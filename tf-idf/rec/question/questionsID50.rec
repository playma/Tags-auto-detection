@LINK:/questions/15149227/interval-set-in-java
@TITLE:Interval set in java
@CONTENT:I have a list of intervals with integer values [eg. [1, 4], [10, 19] etc.]. Is there a way to put these intervals into some java collections' container [eg. Set] such that I can call a 'union' function on the container. The 'union' function should give me a list of intervals such that if any 2 inserted intervals overlap then they should be merged in the output. I tried using the Range class in Guava but ended up comparing all the intervals against each other before merging. An elegant approach to this would be really appreciated ! Here is what I have tried based on the response below. The output is [[1, 15], [17, 20]], which is correct. I wanted to know if there is some exiting API which implements something like this. public static void main(String[] args) {
    // mock data
    List<MyIntRange> rng_lst = new ArrayList<Junk.MyIntRange>();
    rng_lst.add(new MyIntRange(1, 10));
    rng_lst.add(new MyIntRange(5, 15));
    rng_lst.add(new MyIntRange(17, 20));

    // sort intervals by start position
    Collections.sort(rng_lst);

    // merge the intervals which overlap
    List<MyIntRange> res_lst = new ArrayList<Junk.MyIntRange>();
    MyIntRange old_rng = null;
    for (MyIntRange cur_rng : rng_lst) {
        if (old_rng == null) {
            old_rng = cur_rng;
        } else {
            if (old_rng.rng.upperEndpoint() < cur_rng.rng.lowerEndpoint()) {
                // this does not over lap with the next one
                res_lst.add(old_rng);
                old_rng = cur_rng;
            } else {
                // overlap
                old_rng = new MyIntRange(old_rng.rng.lowerEndpoint(),
                        cur_rng.rng.upperEndpoint());
            }
        }
    }
    // add the last range
    res_lst.add(old_rng);

    // done!

    SaveSomewhereElseInternally (str);
    return str;

void useString ()
{

    // Where and how should I cleanup the `str` object?
    // It is not safe `delete str` here because it may be used on another place.

    std::string* str = GetSomeStringFromArbitrarySource ();

If I have a query that returns 100 rows and if I pass 1 to setMaxResults, will this affect the returned result from the SQL server itself(as if running a select top 1 statement) or does Hibernate get all the results first (all 100 rows in this case) and pick the top one itself?

@TITLE:How do I put JPanel on another JPanel?
@CONTENT:I am new to the java (and programming in general) and I am trying to make my very first program. I'm stuck on the same problem for about 5 hours now, so I've decided to ask for help. Basically I'm trying to make a program (2d game) that has about 20 positions on the board. Each position is either blue (owned by player1), red(owned by player2) or black(not owned by anyone). The way I'm going about this is in main I've put a method that calls setup game, and then a method that plays game. I am working on the setup game, basically all it does is it makes an object of class Background (extends JPanel, and overrides paintComponent()) and 20 objects of class Position(extends JPanel, and overrides paintComponent()). So far I'm stuck on putting those Position objects on top of Background object. When I do: Background background= new Background();
frame.getContentPane().add(background);
Position position1= new Position;
frame.getContentPane().add(position1);
frame.setVisible(true);
 it shows only a circle and no background as I was hoping, if I first add position and then background, I only have background and no circle. Anyway I'm new to the java and I am still having trouble founding my way around, however I've tried to search for solutions, and I've found many different solutions to this problem (such as adding position to background first, and then adding background to frame, etc.) but I couldn't make any of them to work. I am aware that the way I am adding them both to frame is (very likely) completely wrong, but I wrote it that way so you would (hopefully) be sure that what I've wrote actually does show you that my code for each of those classes draws something on the screen. PS: I didn't copy my code here as most of variable and method names aren't in English so it's fairly hard to read, but if you still think its needed, I will add it. Also I'm sorry for my probably stupid question, but I'm kinda hitting a wall here and I've no idea what else to try.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out exactly what css is included by the standard call to currentDesign.writeCssIncludes(pagecontext); found in headlibs.jsp. The documentation states simply that it is Convenience method that writes the CSS include strings to the response.
 Looking at what it seems to do, it will include /etc/designs/currentdesign.css which is built off the design components css, and /etc/designs/currentdesign/static.css, which is just a static file. But is this all that is will include? In particular, what I'd like to do is include a clientLib-processed css file as part of my design. One way to do this is to manually build out the css include: <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= currentDesign.getPath() %>/myclientlib.css" />
 But I'd prefer to let that get generated automatically, so that my designers have flexibility to structure the css files differently for different designs (i.e., for the "base" design they are fine with just a static.css file, but for the "fancy" design they want to use LESS css and break up the files more granularly). And it would be helpful to put design-specific css info with the components they affect, rather then needing to separate those.

@TITLE:Regarding internal working of concurrent hashmap
@CONTENT:I was going through the ConcurrentHashMap and this related tutorial, and had some questions. In the article, it was mention that ConcurrentHashMap allows multiple readers to read concurrently without any blocking. This is achieved by partitioning the Map into different parts based on concurrency level and locking only a portion of the Map during updates. Default concurrency level is 16, and accordingly the Map is divided into 16 part and each part is governed with a different lock. This means, 16 threads can operate on Map simultaneously, until they are operating on different parts of the Map. This makes ConcurrentHashMap high performant despite keeping thread-safety intact. Though, it comes with a caveat: Since update operations like put(), remove(), putAll() or clear() are not synchronized, concurrent retrieval may not reflect the most recent change on the Map Another point also mentioned in the article: Another important point to remember is iteration over CHM, Iterator returned by keySet are weakly consistent and they only reflect state of ConcurrentHashMap at a certain point and may not reflect any recent change. I have not understood the points highlighted in bold, could you provide more info or show me in a simple program?

 Is this possible? Any guideline on how to do it? Appreciate in advance.

@TITLE:Is libGDX suited for desktop-only application development?
@CONTENT:I'm currently a few months into teaching myself java via books and online tutorials. Steep learning curve. Since I do that in my sparse free time, I have little hope of getting really good with every aspect of the language anytime soon. I have created simple programs that use lwjgl for the graphics. I am looking for a framework/library that will help me with as much of the technical under-the-hood stuff as possible. I'd rather concentrate on writing a game than becoming an OpenGL genius or inventing a GUI from the ground up when there are libraries "out there" that do it better than I ever could. I simply can't invest the time needed, but would still love to write a game of my own. Would you recommend libGDX for that purpose, considering I only want to write desktop-only applications? Or is it more of an Android-API which also happens to run on Desktop (for debugging?). Are there alternatives better suited for desktop applications? I really like what I've read about libGDX until now, it seems to provide useful tools for every aspect of game-development. I just don't want to invest months in learning about it only to find that library XY would have been even better when it comes to desktop applications. Thanks for your input, any help is appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/15108358/implementing-a-service-locator-with-injected-variations-of-generic-type
@TITLE:Implementing a Service Locator with injected variations of Generic Type
@CONTENT:I have the following: public interface IConverter<TValue, TConverted>
{     
}

public interface IConverterProvider
{
    IConverter<TValue, TConverted> GetConverter<TValue, TConverted>();
}
 With an example binding at setup: Bind<IConverter<System.Int32, System.String>>().To<Int32ToStringConverter>();
Bind<IConverter<System.Guid, System.String>>().To<GuidToStringConverter>();
 So I have a collection of fixed converters and no duplicate bindings. [Question] My question is how do I go about implementing the IConverterProvider and injecting a dictionary of available bindings mapped to singletons? Or in other words, how to avoid the run-time service-locator pattern. Currently I'm just using the NInject kernel to resolve each time, but I believe this an anti-pattern. What I would like is something like this: public class ConverterProvider : IConverterProvider
{
    private Dictionary<Type, object> _converters;

    public ConverterProvider(Dictionary<Type, object> converters)
    {
        _converters = converters;
    }

    public IConverter<TValue, TConverted> GetConverter<TValue, TConverted>()
    {
        var fullTypeResolve = typeof (IConverter<,>).MakeGenericType(typeof (TValue), typeof (TConverted));

        return _converters.Where(x => x.Key == fullTypeResolve).Select(x=>x.Value).Cast<IConverter<TValue, TConverted>>().Single();
    }
}
 But this effectively requires that I'm able to resolve and get a list of all IConverter<,> from the dependency injection kernel, and my previous attempts of doing this from NInject haven't been successful.
@CODE:public interface IConverter<TValue, TConverted>
{     
}

public interface IConverterProvider
{
    IConverter<TValue, TConverted> GetConverter<TValue, TConverted>();
} Bind<IConverter<System.Int32, System.String>>().To<Int32ToStringConverter>();
Bind<IConverter<System.Guid, System.String>>().To<GuidToStringConverter>(); public class ConverterProvider : IConverterProvider
{
    private Dictionary<Type, object> _converters;

    public ConverterProvider(Dictionary<Type, object> converters)
    {
        _converters = converters;
    }

    public IConverter<TValue, TConverted> GetConverter<TValue, TConverted>()
    {
        var fullTypeResolve = typeof (IConverter<,>).MakeGenericType(typeof (TValue), typeof (TConverted));

        return _converters.Where(x => x.Key == fullTypeResolve).Select(x=>x.Value).Cast<IConverter<TValue, TConverted>>().Single();

I am testing using Firefox and the web service is hosted on IIS7 with a self cert (generated with SelfSSL7). Is there any known issues around this? I did check: Cross domain request from HTTP to HTTPS aborts immediately However it mentions the solution is to make sure the cert is trusted, and to my knowledge SelfSSL is doing this using the /T option when I call it.

@LINK:/questions/15080200/gcc-4-7-2-stdthread-with-pointer-to-member-function
@TITLE:GCC 4.7.2: std::thread with pointer to member function
@CONTENT:In writing test code for this question I found that the commented line below does not compile on GCC 4.7.2: #include <thread>
#include <iostream>

struct S {
    void f() {
        std::cout << "Calling f()" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    S s;
    // std::thread t(&S::f, s); // does not compile?
    std::thread t(&S::f, &s);
    t.join();
}
 But cppreference seems to claim that the "this" argument can be passed equivalently as an object, reference to object, or pointer to object: If f is pointer to a member function of class T, then it is called. The return value is ignored. Effectively, the following code is executed: (t1.*f)(t2, ..., tN) if the type of t1 is either T, reference to T or reference to type derived from T. ((*t1).*f)(t2, ..., tN) otherwise. I actually think this sounds terrible, and would prefer std::thread only allow either pointer or reference semantics instead of accepting them interchangeably, but given that it seems like it's supposed to, is the above a GCC/libstdc++ bug (or am I misinterpreting cppreference)?
@CODE:#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

struct S {
    void f() {
        std::cout << "Calling f()" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    S s;
    // std::thread t(&S::f, s); // does not compile?
    std::thread t(&S::f, &s);
    t.join();
} std::thread

@TITLE:iOS: Provide Meaningful Error from NSUrlConnection didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge (Certificate Failure)
@CONTENT:I'm working with the OWASP sample for Certificate and Public Key Pinning. The sample uses random.org, and random.org recently got a new certificate. That means connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: is failing. That is expected and good :) However, the failure is displayed as "NSURLErrorDomain", with a code of -1012. That's not very helpful, and a user will not be able to do anything useful with it. The image is somewhat large, but you can view the screen capture of the useless message at http://i.stack.imgur.com/bxgqB.png. It would be much better to supply a message with text similar to "Warning: the certificate guarding the website has changed...". Another little nit: in connection:didFailWithError:, I cannot tell if the -1012 is due to the pinning failure or another network error. So I would like to supply the message only for the certificate failure, and not other -1012 errors. How does one supply "rich error information" to the call of [[challenge sender] cancelAuthenticationChallenge: challenge] (which is called when connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: fails). NSURLConnectionDelegate Protocol Reference and NSURLAuthenticationChallengeSender Protocol Reference do not mention how to do so. Jeff

@TITLE:Three.js Shader-Texture Blinking
@CONTENT:I'm new to three.js and think it's great. I'm trying to get a better hold on moving texture data to the shader so I can mostly use GPU. I base my program on Mr. Doob's magic dust example, but I'm not using particles rather loaded models stored in a texture. I'm having an issue currently where I get flickering. The code below is a rough example of the flickering and has some closeness to what I'm doing. If anyone could help me understand what I'm doing wrong or where the flickering is coming from ... I'm pretty sure everything is up-to-date, as in the texture mapping and three.js revision. Thanks a lot <!doctype html>

@TITLE:ajaxStart() called only once but ajaxComplete() called multiple times
@CONTENT:I would like to do something on the call of every AJAX request on my page. I read here that ajaxStart (Global Event) This event is broadcast if an Ajax request is started and no other Ajax requests are currently running. and ajaxComplete (Global Event) This event behaves the same as the complete event and will be triggered every time an Ajax request finishes. This means I can only track the start of one ajax event and not each individual request? $(document).ajaxStart(function () {
    var t = new Date(),
        h = t.getHours(),
        m = t.getMinutes(),
        s = t.getSeconds(),
        ms = t.getMilliseconds();
    console.log("Triggered ajaxStart handler   at " + h + ":" + m + ":" + s + ":" + ms);
});


$(document).ajaxComplete(function () {
    var t = new Date(),
        h = t.getHours(),
        m = t.getMinutes(),
        s = t.getSeconds(),
        ms = t.getMilliseconds();
    console.log("Triggered ajaxComplete handler at " + h + ":" + m + ":" + s + ":" + ms);
});

@TITLE:How to get to the DOM element from a knockout binding?
@CONTENT:I have bound a DOM element to a viewModel using knockout. When I change a property on the underlying model it changes the DOM - all ok. However, is there a way to get to the bound DOM element so I can add a class to it when the underlying model gets updated externally? I have used custom binding which gives me access to the DOM element but I was wondering if there is a simpler way directly from the viewModel's bound property? Thanks sample code (TypeScript) SetMyCell(row: number, newValue: any) {

    var ditem = this._DataItems[row];

    // update the actual value    
    ditem.Producer(newValue);

    // Now I wish to decorate the DOM item this Producer property is 
    // bound to with a class. How to go about that?

}

@TITLE:Hover markers missing on disconnected graph
@CONTENT:I'm facing a problem and I am not sure if it's a bug in the highcharts plugin or a programing error. I am using null values to draw a disconnected line graph with only one serie but it seems to be a problem with the hover markers : some of them (on the top of the first line and bottom of the second) just seem to not appear. The code is simple but i can't find what would cause this.

 }); Any idea on how to make those markers reappear ? Thanks in advance. UPDATE 26/02 : I've been testing other scenarios to identify the cause of this problem and here is what i found out : - The problem occurs when lines are too close to each other (on the xAxis) - Zoom doesn't help, even full zoomed on the place where the marker is supposed to appear does not make it appear. - The problem occurs whenever the y values are the same or not UPDATE 25/04 : For an example you can see the bug when trying to hover the point at [47,15] on the green series. Instead of the [47,15] point it is the [47,8] point that is "hovered" and whatever I try (like zooming exactly on it) I just can't "hover" the [47,15] point. I've updated the jsfiddle link and the code above with more exemple to illustrate the problem. Anyone have any idea to fix this ?

@TITLE:Test if subarray of given array
@CONTENT:this is a somewhat basic question from a beginner Numpy user: I have a 2D array of say 5 rows and 2 columns, you can see that as 10 2d-vectors, and I want to test if a given vector is inside the table. For example : >>> tableau = array(range(10), dtype = uint8)
>>> tableau.shape = (5,2)
>>> print tableau
[[ 0  1]
 [ 2  3]
 [ 4  5]
 [ 6  7]
 [ 8  9]]
>>> [0, 1] in tableau
True
 Last line gives True, but '[0, 2] in tableau' too. For the moment, I compute if euclidean distance is 0, but I'm sure there's a simpler answer. Thanks for any help
@CODE:>>> tableau = array(range(10), dtype = uint8)
>>> tableau.shape = (5,2)
>>> print tableau
[[ 0  1]
 [ 2  3]
 [ 4  5]
 [ 6  7]
 [ 8  9]]
>>> [0, 1] in tableau
True

@LINK:/questions/15060005/mvc-side-effect-of-using-httppost-validateinputfalse
@TITLE:MVC Side effect of using [HttpPost, ValidateInput(false)]
@CONTENT:I have a TextArea in my strongly typed View defined with @Html.TextAreaFor(x => x.Text)
 My controller Action originally looked similar to this: [HttpPost]
public ViewResult Index(MyViewModel vm)
{
    using (var db = new MyEntities())
    {
        Post p = new Post();
        p.Text = vm.Text;
        db.Posts.AddObject(p);
        db.SaveChanges();
    }
    return View();
}
 This worked fine. The text the user entered into the TextArea was passed into the controller and saved into the Post table in SQL Server via Entity Framework. The data type for this field is varchar(1000). (There is also Model validation on the Text field using MetadataType with [StringLength(1000)] validation.) I noticed that if I tried to copy some HTML source and paste it into the TextArea and submit it, I received the following error: "A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client" The error led me to this question, and the take away from there was that I could simply add [HttpPost, ValidateInput(false)]
 to my Action to stop that type of validation. This worked wonderfully, but to my surpise, no matter what I tried putting into the TextArea, I couldn't cause any problems. If I paste in javascript, html or T-SQL statements riddled with quote characters, it still works fine. I see the exact characters I entered into the TextArea appearing in the SQL table, and if I display the text back to the View, I see in the source each character is converted to the HTML counterpart, and the display on the screen looks just like it did when I entered it in. I did not do any sort of text conversion to accomplish this. It seems by default everything is working exactly as I want it to. Of course I'm glad for this, but when I read about disabling the validation, it is often followed with a warning that you should understand the consequences of doing this, and I don't think I do. So I wonder, what are the consequences? Is there anything someone could possibly type into my TextArea that could mess things up as a result of disabling the input validation? In case it's relevant, my particular setup is MVC4, .NET 4.0, Entity Framework 4.4, SQL Server 2012 Express.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How do C++ progs get their return value, when a return is not specified in the function? 6 answers I have just spend 3 hours, probably more, trying to find a bug, segfault or bad_allow, depending on the way I modified the code so as to understand what object was messing with the stack or memory: I put all my objects in doubt... I slaughtered classes... ( nonetheless this turned out to be good since those classes revealed themselves useless in the end :-) )... But, indeed, the real mistake was simply: I hadn't written a return statement in a function that should return a value (in my case I needed to return a std::vector<boost::any>). I thought that gcc (4.6.3) couldn't have compiled without it. And I feel even stranger remembering that something similar has happened to me with ms visual 2010. So now I am wondering whether it is legal not to write a return statement ?? What happens in such cases ? Is it related with the fact that the main that can have a return value or not ? Or should I consider going to gcc 4.7 ?

 It loads the data correctly on the first load (the 0 case), but then when I click to expand any of the folders, it is giving me the error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'addBack' 
 Even though the correct id of the expanded node is being logged to the console and the ajax request is being made to the server correctly. Notice also that I have to use a fairly horrific kludge to find the id of the element due to the fact that the documented code produces nothing but errors for me (and I am using the same version of jsTree as the documentation) when trying to access n.attr("id"). Plus, under bind("select_node"... I have to use a non-documented function to find the id again. After hours of troubleshooting, I'm still completely baffled, but something is clearly not operating correctly.

@TITLE:convert from float-point to custom numeric type
@CONTENT:I've created my own fixed-type integer types and the library works fine with many compilers and platforms, the only problem left to solve is to convert from built-in float-point types to my types. The float-point types may have small mantissa but along with exponent it may have big value so if i choose to cast float, double, or long double say to long long or unsigned long long a truncation may occur. If the compiler use IEEE-754 specification it'll be easy to extract mantissa and exponent, but what if the compiler use some other format. So, my question: is there any generic algorithm that allows me to extract the full value from a float-point using only the language features? thanks

        nyansoundm.play()

    return nyansecond,nyanint,spin
 I then def it into my code on the second page I implemented (which works fine). It runs the nyansound, but doesn't run nyansoundm after 6.5 seconds (6500 milliseconds). I'm making this program to help me learn the basics of python and pygame, before moving on to more complex stuff. I can also use it when I want to listen to nyan cat or other looped songs without having to go on youtube and waste precious bandwidth. Don't worry about that, though. Oh, and here is the code I have put into my loop, although I do not think this matters too much: #music
        nyansecond,nyanint,spin = nyanmusic(nyansecond,nyanint,spin)
@CODE:nyansecond=462346
nyanint=0
spin=0
aftin=452345

def nyanmusic(nyansecond,nyanint,spin):
    if nyanint == 0:
        nyansound.play()
        nyanint= 1
    elif nyanint == 1:
        nyansecond = pygame.time.set_timer(USEREVENT+1,7000)
    if nyansecond < 200 and spin == 1:
        spin = 0
        nyansecond = pygame.time.set_timer(USEREVENT+1,7000)
    elif nyansecond > 6500 and nyansecond < 100000 and spin == 0:
        spin = 1
        nyansoundm.play()

    return nyansecond,nyanint,spin #music
        nyansecond,nyanint,spin = nyanmusic(nyansecond,nyanint,spin)

@TITLE:Equal-height scaling cells in an html table

    |             |                 |
    +-------------+-----------------+
 In short, the top of the right-hand two cells is reduced as small as possible, and the bottom one fills the rest of the space. There is an ugly workaround using embedded tables, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution. This can also be circumvented by assuming a fixed height for the left-hand cell, and forcing the size (in pixels) for the right-hand cells. This defeats the purpose of a scaling-height cell, though.

@TITLE:How to prepopulate a dialog in angularjs/bootstrap
@CONTENT:This question is in regards to angluarjs using bootstrap css and javascript. I have a list of items that I want to display and set up so that clicking on them opens a dialog to allow you to change the values. Something like this: <!-- The repeater !-->
<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="item in items" ng-click="showDlg(item)">
        {{item.text}}
    </li>
</ul>
<!-- The dialog !-->
<div id="dlg" class="modal hide fade">
    <div class="modal body">
         <input id="title" type="text">
         <button type="button">ok</button>
    </div>
<div>
 The question is how do I implement the showDlg function to put up #dlg as a pop up dialog prepopulated with the fields from item (in this trivial case putting item.text into the input box.) I can, and in fact do, hack it by setting the values directly:  $scope.showDialog = function(item) {
     $("#dlg #title").val(item.text);
     $(#dlg).modal({});
 }
 But it seems to me that I should be using a controller for the dialog and setting it up as a form. I can see how to set it up as a form, but not how to get the data into the form to start with. Any help would be appreciated.
@CODE:<!-- The repeater !-->
<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="item in items" ng-click="showDlg(item)">
        {{item.text}}
    </li>
</ul>
<!-- The dialog !-->
<div id="dlg" class="modal hide fade">
    <div class="modal body">
         <input id="title" type="text">
         <button type="button">ok</button>
    </div>
<div> $scope.showDialog = function(item) {
     $("#dlg #title").val(item.text);
     $(#dlg).modal({});

@CONTENT:a and b are ActiveRecord::Relation objects which return the same type of objects(Micropost objects in this case) a.class

 Is there some way to "OR" both Relation objects and return another Relation object in Rails 3.2.11? Do I need to use some gem such as squeel to do it? If it can't be done: Why it can't be done? Can I paginate the array resulting from a|b without loading every record from the database? If it can be done: Could anyone please write an example of how to do it? Thanks in advance. EDIT: I copied the wrong variables into the block of code, b was not an ActiveRecord::Relation, it was actually an array and that is why a.merge(b) returned []. My fault. TLDR: Question is wrong, and array can be paginated :)
@CODE:a b a.class

 To generate a larger set -> First define the sample above as Genedata then the additional code (to change variable/column length, just change 1000 to 5000 or 50000 etc.     data <- replicate(1000, abs(rnorm(177)))
    Genedata <- data.frame(Genedata, data)
library(data.table)
    Genedata2 <- data.table(Genedata)
 Then to calculate     #Calculating Maxstat
    library(maxstat)
    maxstat.genes <- as.list( names(Genedata) )[-c(1:3)] #generate a list of column numbers
system.time(maxstat.estimate <-lapply( maxstat.genes, function (x)
{maxstat.test(Surv(time, cens) ~ get (x), data=Genedata2, smethod="LogRank",
pmethod="Lau94")}))
 I originally planned on using the for statement, as i'm familiar with it having a background in python. However, research has told me that using apply should be faster. I also originally used data.frame, but switched to data.table as someone suggested this should be better for performance. However, it seems there is still a significant problem with processing large datasets. Below is an explanation of why. Running 25 variables    user  system elapsed 
   0.04    0.00    0.05  
 Running 1000 variables   user  system elapsed 
   6.54    0.00    6.57 
 Running 5000 variables   user  system elapsed 
 132.89    0.00  133.02 
 As you can see, the processing speed is not linear but rather begins to fall off at a staggering rate. Given that the dataset is 43000 variables long, I can only guess that it would take on the order of hours. Interestingly, if i manually divided the tables into small sets, and ran them individually, it would be faster. I think it has something to do with copying increasingly larger data, but I' not sure how this could be fixed. I already tried the data.table and lapply. Any suggestions? Update 1: Added sample data. Note to reproduce a larger dataset. You can copy columns 4 onwards and paste. Rows can also be copied down. Should work as far as i know. Update 2: Rprof on 1000 variables > Rprof(NULL)
> summaryRprof()

@LINK:/questions/15052044/vim-folding-with-rainbowparentheses
@TITLE:Vim Folding with RainbowParentheses
@CONTENT:So, I've looked everywhere for a good rainbow parentheses plugin that will give different level parentheses different colors. I really like the couple that I've found, because they both do a good job of customizability while highlighting the right thing. It supports more than parentheses; chevrons, braces and brackets all get highlighted, which I really like. It seems like there are quite a few plugins for this!; I'm currently using oblitum's because his is optimized for dark backgrounds (I often work straight from the shell). So, following the tip at the github for that plugin, I have the "always on" snippet in my .vimrc. But when the always on block is above "syntax enable" it doesn't show {} as being highlighted for cpp files. When the always on block is below syntax enable, folding doesn't work. I think its the nature of the plugin that makes it do this; it goes though the file and adds coloration information. I notice that if I use the command :syntax enable after I've loaded the file when its not recognizing folds, then it does recognize the folds. But at this point, it removes the coloration that rainbow parentheses put on it. In my .vimrc, I have the follow pertinent lines: syntax enable
set foldmethod=syntax
set foldenable
set foldlevel=100

let g:rainbow_operators=2
au FileType c,cpp,objc,objcpp call rainbow#activate()
 I think that, from looking at syntax files that come with vim, such as c.vim, you can see that certain blocks are annotated as folding. I bet that if you could just write a regex based upon it, you could identify characters as syntactic groups. Then you could just define a colorscheme for it. In fact, the rainbow plugin is actually calling "syn region" commands, so I think that this route is very doable, I'm just not that knowledgable with vim scripting. Can anybody help me modify possibly the plugin or come up with a script or something that achieves both?
@CODE:.vimrc {} syntax enable :syntax enable .vimrc syntax enable
set foldmethod=syntax

@LINK:/questions/15044342/sum-of-hybrid-data-frames-depending-on-multiple-conditions-in-r
@TITLE:Sum of hybrid data frames depending on multiple conditions in R
@CONTENT:This is a more complex follow-up to my previous question. The answer there was to use a matrix, but that doesn't work with data frames having values of different modes. I want to combine data frames of different sizes, with character and integer columns, and calculate their sum depending on multiple conditions. Conditions sums are only calculated for those rows that have a matching "Name"-value sums are calculated for matching column names only if a cell in df4 is not 0 and not NA, the sum should be df3 + df4 else the sum should be df1 + df2 + df3 Example > df1 <- data.frame(Name=c("Joe","Ann","Lee","Dan"), "1"=c(0,1,5,2), "2"=c(3,1,0,0), "3"=c(2,0,2,2), "4"=c(2,1,3,4))
> df1
  Name X1 X2 X3 X4
1  Joe  0  3  2  2
2  Ann  1  1  0  1
3  Lee  5  0  2  3
4  Dan  2  0  2  4

> df2 <- data.frame(Name=c("Joe","Ann","Ken"), "1"=c(3,4,1), "2"=c(2,3,0), "3"=c(2,4,3))
> df2
  Name X1 X2 X3
1  Joe  3  2  2
2  Ann  4  3  4
3  Ken  1  0  3

> df3 <- data.frame(Name=c("Lee","Ben"), "1"=c(1,3), "2"=c(3,4), "3"=c(4,3))
> df3
  Name X1 X2 X3
1  Lee  1  3  4
2  Ben  3  4  3
 The condition depends on this frame: > df4 <- data.frame(Name=c("Lee","Ann","Dan"), "1"=c(6,0,NA), "2"=c(0,0,4), "3"=c(0,NA,0))
> df4
   Name  X1  X2  X3
1   Lee   6   0   0
2   Ann   0   0  NA 
3   Dan  NA   4   0
 With the above examples, this is the expected result (* values depend on df4): > dfsum
  Name  X1  X2  X3  X4
1  Joe   3   5   4   2
2  Ann   5   4   4   1
3  Lee   7*  3   6   3
4  Dan   2   4*  2   4
5  Ken   1   0   3  NA
6  Ben   3   4   3  NA
 Possible steps? First expand df1, df2, df3, df4 to 5 columns and 6 rows, fill missing data with NA. Then for each data frame: sort rows by "Name" separate "Name" column from "X1"..."X4" transform "X1"..."X4" columns to matrix calculate sums of the matrices like in the answer to my other question but with the additional condition 1 transform result matrix to data frame cbind the "Name" column with the result data frame How can this be done in R? Solution @Ricardo Saporta's solution works with little changes: Add , padValue=NA) in the four addCols(). As answered here, replace the definitions of sumD3D4 and dtsum with: plus <- function(x) {
  if(all(is.na(x))){
    c(x[0],NA)} else {
      sum(x,na.rm = TRUE)}
}

sumD3D4  <- setkey(rbind(dt3, dt4)[,lapply(.SD, plus), by = Name], "Name")
dtsum <- setkey(rbind(dt1, dt2, dt3)[, lapply(.SD, plus), by=Name], "Name")

@CONTENT:I have a little problem in php, which i find hard to explain in words. I have an associative array which contains key-value. I would like to make a function (or if there is already one) which would take an array as input and remove the duplicates but both ways. For example: In my array I have {a -> b} {a -> c} {b -> a} {b -> c} ... From this view it does not seem like there is any duplicate, but to me {a -> b} and {b -> a} are duplicate. So I would like the function to see it as a duplicate and only return one of them. I tried to use array_flip / array_unique to exchange the key and the values, in a loop but didn't quite work. Could you help to find a way to do this even if it is array with a large length? or if there is a php function which does it. Help would be really appreciated, thanks.

system(cmd1)

@TITLE:Enumerator vs Iterator in scala and java
@CONTENT:What is the difference between Enumerator and Iterator? Per my understanding Enumerator is not a fancy alias for enum in Java. Rather, it seems to be a traversal technique similar to an Iterator. So is anyone able to compare and contrast Enumerator and Iterator? Also, I see a usage in Play as val data = getDataStream
val dataContent: Enumerator[Array[Byte]] = Enumerator.fromStream(data)
 EDIT: I am inclined to think that Enumerator gives us actual chunks of data, whereas Iterator gives us pointers to data that is already chunked, such as a list. But I am not convinced that that's the case.

 I know there is hierarchy methods in SQL Server and built-ins like GetLevel and more. Can this be used to get the same results? To create dual table if needed (not sure) - copied from here:http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2010/07/20/sql-server-select-from-dual-dual-equivalent/ CREATE TABLE DUAL
(
DUMMY VARCHAR(1)

GO
INSERT INTO DUAL (DUMMY)

 Specifically looking for examples that would let use smth. like LEVEL in queries. For example: there is only one start date in the table - 4/22/2013. But with LEVEL I'm able to increment it as follows: SELECT start_date, start_date+LEVEL-1 AS start_date_btwn
  FROM my_tab
 WHERE id = 1
CONNECT BY LEVEL<=10

START_DATE    START_DATE_BTWN

 Initially, I was getting this error when I did not define jersey-servlet, but I did some searching, and presumably, jersey-servlet.jar is the one that contains that class. However, that did solve the error.

@TITLE:Can a function be optimized for tail recursion even when there are more than one distinct recursive calls?
@CONTENT:As I mentioned in a recent SO question, I'm learning F# by going through the Project Euler problems. I now have a functioning answer to Problem 3 that looks like this: let rec findLargestPrimeFactor p n = 
    if n = 1L then p
    else
        if n % p = 0L then findLargestPrimeFactor p (n/p)
        else findLargestPrimeFactor (p + 2L) n

let result = findLargestPrimeFactor 3L 600851475143L
 However, since there are 2 execution paths that can lead to a different call to findLargestPrimeFactor, I'm not sure it can be optimized for tail recursion. So I came up with this instead: let rec findLargestPrimeFactor p n = 
    if n = 1L then p
    else
        let (p', n') = if n % p = 0L then (p, (n/p)) else (p + 2L, n)
        findLargestPrimeFactor p' n'

let result = findLargestPrimeFactor 3L 600851475143L
 Since there's only one path that leads to a tail call to findLargestPrimeFactor, I figure it is indeed going to be optimized for tail recursion. So my questions: Can the first implementation be optimized for tail recursion even if there are two distinct recursive calls? If both versions can be optimized for tail recursion, is there one better (more "functional", faster, etc) than the other?
@CODE:let rec findLargestPrimeFactor p n = 
    if n = 1L then p
    else
        if n % p = 0L then findLargestPrimeFactor p (n/p)
        else findLargestPrimeFactor (p + 2L) n

let result = findLargestPrimeFactor 3L 600851475143L findLargestPrimeFactor let rec findLargestPrimeFactor p n = 
    if n = 1L then p
    else
        let (p', n') = if n % p = 0L then (p, (n/p)) else (p + 2L, n)
        findLargestPrimeFactor p' n'

let result = findLargestPrimeFactor 3L 600851475143L findLargestPrimeFactor

@LINK:/questions/15029611/c11-late-binding-of-template-arguments
@TITLE:C++11 late binding of template arguments
@CONTENT:Please don't get my "late binding" wrong, I don't mean usual late binding at runtime, I mean something else and cannot find a better word for it: Consider I am working on a container (or similar) data structure Containor for some value type V that needs to compare these values with a comparator, so my first template looks like this template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>>
struct Containor{};
 Now, my Containor structure makes use of another container internally. Which container is to be used should be configurable by template arguments as well, lets say the default is std::set. So my next version of Containor looks like this: template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>, typename Cont = std::set<Val,Comp>>
struct Containor{};
 and here is where the code begins smelling IMHO. As long as the user is satisfied with the default implementation of the inner container, everything is fine. However, suppose he wants to use the new google btree set implementation btree::btree_set instead of std::set. Then he has to instanciate the template like this: typedef Containor<int,std::less<int>,btree::btree_set<int,std::less<int>> MyContainor;
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 I have underlined the part where my problem lies. The CLIENT CODE has to instanciate the btree_set with the right parameters. This honestly sucks, because the Containor class always needs a set of exactly the same type and comparator as its own first two template arguments. The client can - by accident - insert other types here! In addition, the client has the burden of choosing the right parameters. This might be easy in this case, but it hard if the inner container must for example be a set of pairs of the value type and some other type. Then the client has an even harder time getting the type parameters of the inner set correct. So what I want is a way in which the client code only hands in the raw template and the Containor internally instanciates it with the correct arguments, i.e. something like that: template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>, typename Cont = std::set >
struct Containor{
    typedef Cont<Val,Comp> innerSet; 
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ container instanciates the inner containor
};

typedef Containor<int,std::less<int>,btree::btree_set> MyContainor;
//                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                         client only hands in  raw template
 Of course, this is no valid C++! So I thought about ways to solve this problem. The only solution I could think of was writing "binder classes" for all data structures I want to use, like this: struct btree_set_binder{

    template<typename V, typename C = std::less<V>>
    struct bind{
        typedef btree::btree_set<V,C> type;
    }
};
 Now I can define my Containor with a set binder template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>, typename ContBinder = btree_set_binder >
struct Containor{
    typedef btree_set_binder::bind<Val,Comp>::type innerSet; 
//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ works like a charm
};
 Now, the user must only supply the desired binder class and the Containor will instanciate it with the right arguments. So these binder classes would be okay for me, but it is quite a hassle writing binder classes for all containers. So is there a better or easier way to bind template arguments "late" in C++11, i.e., inside another template that retrieves the raw template as parameter.
@CODE:Containor V template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>>
struct Containor{}; Containor std::set Containor template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>, typename Cont = std::set<Val,Comp>>
struct Containor{}; btree::btree_set std::set typedef Containor<int,std::less<int>,btree::btree_set<int,std::less<int>> MyContainor;
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Containor Containor template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>, typename Cont = std::set >
struct Containor{
    typedef Cont<Val,Comp> innerSet; 
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ container instanciates the inner containor
};

typedef Containor<int,std::less<int>,btree::btree_set> MyContainor;
//                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                         client only hands in  raw template struct btree_set_binder{

    template<typename V, typename C = std::less<V>>
    struct bind{
        typedef btree::btree_set<V,C> type;
    }
}; Containor template<typename Val, typename Comp = std::less<Val>, typename ContBinder = btree_set_binder >
struct Containor{
    typedef btree_set_binder::bind<Val,Comp>::type innerSet; 
//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ works like a charm
}; Containor Cont::key_compare

@CONTENT:I have a HTML table which has records pulled in from the database. The entries from the Column "Time of Call" is retrieved from the MySQL Database. The entries in the column "Timer" is not retrieved from the database, it's a Javascript timer.

@TITLE:Magento changing the dropdown configurable product options for divs
@CONTENT:Friends, once again I need your help, I'm stuck on this... I need to show the options of a configurable product as divs with an "a" inside that let the user make click in the option and select it, instead of the dropdown list. Like a menu (the goal is to show shoe sizes). As many of you know magento uses a Json response to fill the options of the dropdown menu. (var spConfig = new Product.Config(getJsonConfig() ?>) and the class is located in js/varien/product.js (Product.Config = Class.create() ). Then, what I did was to edit the file template/catalog/product/view/type/options/configurable.phtml and replace the original behavior for something like this. '<?php
     echo ' 
                <ul class="super-attribute-select">';
         $resultado = json_decode($this->getJsonConfig(), true);
         $atributo=$resultado['attributes'][162]['options'];
         foreach($atributo as $att){
             echo '<li>';
             echo '<a value="'.$att['id'].'" price="'.$att['price'].'" href="javascript:void()" onclick="return assignValue()">'.$att['label'].'</a>';
             echo '</li>';
             }
     echo ' </ul>
            <div class="clear"></div>';
     ?>'
 This simple mod let me replace the menu for a little grid formed by divs. But now I'm tring to make a javascript function that emulates the native behavior but just for the option when is selected (In this case the shoe size). As I understand the code it sends the option value with the form, so my idea was to create an input hidden an then assign the value throught a javascript function when the user make click, something like this '<script>
  function assignValue(value){
   //assign the value       
      document.getElementById('super_attribute[162]').value = value;
   //mod the class of the selected item
      this.addClassName("selected");
</script>'
 Then I think it could be necessary to create a function or call a method that magento already has to make the value required. Even I don't know if it could be a good idea to set the class "required-entry" on the hidden input. Could you helpme please? Any kind of help or other ideas will be highly apreciated. Warming regards!!
@CODE:'<?php
     echo ' 
                <ul class="super-attribute-select">';
         $resultado = json_decode($this->getJsonConfig(), true);
         $atributo=$resultado['attributes'][162]['options'];
         foreach($atributo as $att){
             echo '<li>';
             echo '<a value="'.$att['id'].'" price="'.$att['price'].'" href="javascript:void()" onclick="return assignValue()">'.$att['label'].'</a>';
             echo '</li>';
             }
     echo ' </ul>
            <div class="clear"></div>';
     ?>' '<script>
  function assignValue(value){
   //assign the value       
      document.getElementById('super_attribute[162]').value = value;

@TITLE:JavaScript sync two arrays (of objects) / find delta
@CONTENT:I have two arrays, old and new, which hold objects at each position. How would I sync or find the delta (i.e. what is new, updated and deleted from the new array compared to the old array) var o = [
    {id:1, title:"title 1", type:"foo"},
    {id:2, title:"title 2", type:"foo"},

    {id:2, title:"title updated", type:"foo"},
    {id:4, title:"title 4", type:"foo"}
];
 With the above data, using id as the key, we'd find that item with id=2 has an updated title, item with id=3 is deleted, and item with id=4 is new. Is there an existing library out there that has useful functions, or is it a case of loop and inner loop, compare each row..e.g. for(var i=0, l=o.length; i<l; i++)
{   
    for(var x=0, ln=n.length; x<ln; x++)
    {
        //compare when o[i].id == n[x].id    
    }

 Do this kind of comparison three times, to find new, updated and deleted?
@CODE:var o = [
    {id:1, title:"title 1", type:"foo"},
    {id:2, title:"title 2", type:"foo"},

@TITLE:Invoking Java from C++: how to catch/detect a fatal JVM error?
@CONTENT:I'm developing a C++ program (Win32, MS Visual Studio 2008) which creates a Java VM via JNI as outlined here. It has been working fine for a long time, with both Java 6 and Java 7. Today I have installed a new version of JRE; something went wrong in the installer, and the JRE become corrupt. I noticed that my C++ program doesn't start and doesn't issue any warning messages. Debugging the program showed that it runs successfully until the JNI_CreateJavaVM call; but calling JNI_CreateJavaVM causes the program to instantly terminate. No return values, no error messages, nothing. Yes, I know that I simply have to reinstall JRE. But nevertheless I'd like my C++ program to be prepared to such situation. If it's unable to create a Java VM, it should show a message "Please reinstall JRE". But I don't have a chance to show that message because the whole program is terminating. Is there a way to detect such type of errors in JRE, or more generally, in a third-party library? I tried using C++ try/catch constructs, I tried using the signal function - nothing helps; the program disappears without calling any catch or signal handlers. Is there a way to detect such JRE crash? Or: is there a way to reliably detect a crash or termination inside a third-party library?

@CONTENT:I have been visiting some services api website but can't find what I am looking for. My question is more aimed at what resources to use rather than how exactly it should be done. My iphone app requirement is to be able to track users that are nearby, are commuting and locate them on map. Additional requirement maybe texting them, call them, have video session with them etc. On a high level, this will convert to something like get user details based on longitude and latitude get to know if they are registered users of the service subscribed Sending message to user/users Call user using iphone phone api or dedicated app session Video call Waze is one of them. While it is open source, there is quite less documentation on how one can use it as backend for real time traffic data. Then there is this Geoloqi which is paid, but has iOS SDK as well as rich api. However I cannot find sections that are useful to me when I look up to my requirements listed above. What I believe is that there must be many apps already relying on such a useful service. If any of them are open source / tutorials, it would be most useful resource for me for feasibility of geoloqi. Geoloqi also charges users for using their api, so it is also important for me to know what features come at what price .

@CONTENT:I have a series of ListView objects in Fragments that are being populated by a CursorAdapter which gets a Cursor from the LoaderManager for the activity.

 I put some log code into my CursorAdapter that tells me when getView(...), getItem(...) or getItemId(...) are being called and it seems as though this is happening on the first getView(...) for a given adapter after a lot of getView(...)s for another adapter. It also happens after a user has navigated around the app a lot. This makes me wonder if the Cursor for an adapter is being retained in the CursorAdapter, but being closed in error by the ContentProvider or the Loader. Is this possible? Should I be doing any housekeeping on the CursorAdapter based on app/activity/fragment lifecycle events? ContentProvider query method: class MyContentProvider extends ContentProvider {

 I have read this question but unfortunately it hasn't got the answer to my problem as it simply suggests using a ContentProvider, which I am. IllegalStateException: attempt to re-open an already-closed object. SimpleCursorAdapter problems IMPORTANT NEW INFORMATION THAT HAS JUST COME TO LIGHT I discovered some other code elsewhere in the project that was NOT using Loaders and NOT managing its Cursors properly. I've just switched this code over to use the same pattern as above; however, if this fixes things, it would suggest that an unmanaged Cursor in one part of a project can kill a properly managed one elsewhere. Stick around. OUTCOME OF NEW INFORMATION That did not fix it. NEW IDEA @Override
onDestroyView() {
    getActivity().getLoaderManager().destroyLoader(mFragmentId);
    //any other destroy-time code
    super.onDestroyView()
}
 ie possibly yes, I should be doing housekeeping on the CursorAdapter (or rather the CursorLoader in line with lifecycle events). OUTCOME OF NEW IDEA Nope. PREVIOUS IDEA Turned out to work once I added in a minor tweak! However it's so complex that I should probably rewrite the entire question.

@LINK:/questions/14956541/serial-i-o-overlapped-non-overlapped-with-windows-windows-ce
@TITLE:Serial I/O Overlapped/Non-Overlapped with Windows/Windows CE
@CONTENT:I'm sorry this isn't much of a question, but more of to help people having problems with these particular things. The problem I'm working on requires the use of Serial I/O, but is primarily running under Windows CE 6.0. However, I was recently asked if the application could also be made to work under Windows too, so I set about solving this problem. I did spend quite a lot of time looking around to see if anyone had the answers I was looking for and it all came across as a lot of misinformation and things that were just basically wrong in some instances. So having solved this problem, I thought I'd share my findings with everyone so anyone encountering these difficulties would have answers. Under Windows CE, OVERLAPPED I/O is NOT supported. This means that bi-directional communication through the serial port can be quite troublesome. The main problem being that when you are waiting on data from the serial port, you cannot send data because doing so will cause your main thread to block until the read operation completes or timeouts (depending on whether you've set timeouts up) Like most people doing serial I/O, I had a reader serial thread set up for reading the serial port, which used WaitCommEvent() with an EV_RXCHAR mask to wait for serial data. Now this is where the difficulty arises with Windows and Windows CE. If I have a simple reader thread like this, as an example:- UINT SimpleReaderThread(LPVOID thParam)
{
    DWORD eMask;
    WaitCommEvent(thParam, &eMask, NULL);
    MessageBox(NULL, TEXT("Thread Exited"), TEXT("Hello"), MB_OK);
}
 Obviously in the above example, I'm not reading the data from the serial port or anything and I'm assuming that thParam contains the opened handle to the comm port etc. Now, the problem is under Windows when your thread executes and hits the WaitCommEvent(), your reader thread will go to sleep waiting for serial port data. Okay, that's fine and as it should be, but... how do you end this thread and get the MessageBox() to appear? Well, as it turns out, it's not actually that easy and is a fundamental difference between Windows CE and Windows in the way it does its Serial I/O. Under Windows CE, you can do a couple of things to make the WaitCommEvent() fall through, such as SetCommMask(COMMPORT_HANDLE, 0) or even CloseHandle(COMMPORT_HANDLE). This will allow you to properly terminate your thread and therefore release the serial port for you to start sending data again. However neither of these things will work under Windows and both will cause the thread you call them from to sleep waiting on the completion of the WaitCommEvent(). So, how do you end the WaitCommEvent() under Windows? Well, ordinarily you'd use OVERLAPPED I/O and the thread blocking wouldn't be an issue, but since the solution has to be compatible with Windows CE as well, OVERLAPPED I/O isn't an option. There is one thing you can do under Windows to end the WaitCommEvent() and that is to call the CancelSynchronousIo() function and this will end your WaitCommEvent(), but be aware this can be device dependent. The main problem with CancelSynchronousIo() is that it isn't supported by Windows CE either, so you're out of luck using that for this problem! So how do you do it? The fact is, to solve this problem, you simply can't use WaitCommEvent() as there is no way to terminate this function on Windows that is supported by Windows CE. That then leaves you with ReadFile() which again will block whilst it is reading NON OVERLAPPED I/O and this WILL work with Comm Timeouts. Using ReadFile() and a COMMTIMEOUTS structure does mean that you will have to have a tight loop waiting for your serial data, but if you're not receiving large amount of serial data, it shouldn't be a problem. Also an event for ending your loop with a small timeout will also ensure that resources are passed back to the system and you're not hammering the processor at 100% load. Below is the solution I came up with and would appreciate some feedback, if you think it could be improved. typedef struct
{
    UINT8 sync;
    UINT8 op
    UINT8 dev;
    UINT8 node;
    UINT8 data;
    UINT8 csum;
} COMMDAT;

COMSTAT cs = {0};
DWORD byte_count;
COMMDAT cd;

ZeroMemory(&cd, sizeof(COMMDAT));
bool recv = false;
do
{
    ClearCommError(comm_handle, 0, &cs);
    if (cs.cbInQue == sizeof(COMMDAT))
    {
        ReadFile(comm_handle, &cd, sizeof(COMMDAT), &byte_count, NULL);
        recv = true;
    }
} while ((WaitForSingleObject(event_handle, 2) != WAIT_OBJECT_0) && !recv);
ThreadExit(recv ? cd.data : 0xFF);
 So to end the thread you just signal the event in the event_handle and that allow you to exit the thread properly and clean up resources and works correctly on Windows and Windows CE. Hope that helps everyone who I've seen has had difficulty with this problem.

 now how do i set my dt as ItemsSource, Datacontext or what ever to get it in to my View also if you could provide me a way to bind directly to my Object ff anything that could help is greatly appreciated

@TITLE:Wrapper's parseXXX() for signed binary misunderstanding
@CONTENT:Let's take Byte.parseByte() as an example as one of the wrappers' parseXXX(). From parseByte(String s, int radix)'s JavaDoc: Parses the string argument as a signed byte in the radix specified by the second argument. But that's not quite true if radix = 2. In other words, the binary literal of -127 is 10000000: byte b = (byte) 0b10000000;
 So the following should be true: byte b = Byte.parseByte("10000000", 2);
 but unfortunately, it throws NumberFormatException, and instead I have to do it as follows: byte b = Byte.parseByte("-111111", 2);
 where parseByte() parses the binary string as a sign-magnitude (the sign and the magnitude), where it should parse as a signed binary (2's complement, i.e. MSB is the sign-bit). Am I wrong about this?
@CODE:Byte.parseByte() parseXXX() parseByte(String s, int radix)'s JavaDoc radix = 2 -127 10000000 byte b = (byte) 0b10000000; byte b = Byte.parseByte("10000000", 2); NumberFormatException byte b = Byte.parseByte("-111111", 2); parseByte()

@CONTENT:So I have my iOS App (it's a social networking one) and I would like to add a messaging and chat system. I've looked up ways to do this but haven't found one that I could either fully understand or implement as most were too complicated for what I want. I have a "friend list" view controller and when touched in one of the names in the list , a "messages" view controller (just like any im window) goes in where you can chat with the selected friend. The ways I found to do this were either XMPP or "a TCP connection". I tried understanding XMPP but for XMPP you need "logging in" etc, and that would require an extra id or something which would complicate things. I already have my in app users ID V I don't want a second one just for chat. The second method V making a TCP connection and sending messages via that connection V I could not fully understand nor find examples of it implemented.

 See that c7 chunk size before json data. How can I read a raw response stream without chunks in Windows Phone using HttpWebResponse? Hint: to make sever disable chunked output, I just have to specify HTTP/1.0 protocol version. But I don't know how to do that as there is no ProtocolVersion property in HttpWebRequest class in Windows Phone or Silverlight

@TITLE:HTML5Boilerplate js structure
@CONTENT:I'm wondering if someone can check my understanding of what the intended purpose of HTML5Boilerplate js directories. I understand that main.js is where I'm expected to place all site specific javascript that I author. Plugins.js is where I would place all jQuery plugins used. Both main.js and plugins.js will be concatenated and minified by the build process. Vendor.js holds javascript libraries. This directory will be minified (unless it is already minified) but not concatenated. If this is true, then my question is where should something like cute slider which has a modular structure be placed? I'm thinking I want it to be minified and concatenated so it shouldn't go in the vendor directory. I don't believe I can add cuteslider's javascript to main.js or plugins.js without destroying it's modular structure. Should I create a new directory, and call it something like apps, to hold cuteslider code and then modify the build code to minified and concatenated it? Here is a snippet of cuteslider's code structure cute

@TITLE:How do Java profilers work, internally?
@CONTENT:I'm in the process of investigating how profilers work internally. It seems there is an old API named JVMPI, as well as a "new" API based on java.lang.instrument. I had the idea that profilers instrument all the classes' bytecode and insert hooks that call via sockets info to a given program's open-point, so establishing a communication with the profiler. Is this the standard approach? Do they differ considerably in approach? Thanks

@TITLE:Vertically centering child div in parent container with JavaScript on page load is not setting position?
@CONTENT:I am using JavaScript to vertically center a child div within a fluid container. I essentially accomplish this by calculating the height of the parent container and the height of the child div.

@TITLE:How does the scheme below garantees there'll be just one definition for the objects cin, cout, K?
@CONTENT:Here you'll find the following statements under Which header ? : Finally, <iostream> provides the eight standard global objects (cin, cout, etc). To do this correctly, this header also provides the contents of the <istream> and <ostream> headers, but nothing else. The contents of this header look like #include <ostream>
#include <istream>

namespace std
{
    extern istream cin;
    extern ostream cout;
    ....

    // this is explained below
    static ios_base::Init __foo;    // not its real name
}
 Now, the runtime penalty mentioned previously: the global objects must be initialized before any of your own code uses them; this is guaranteed by the standard. Like any other global object, they must be initialized once and only once. This is typically done with a construct like the one above, and the nested class ios_base::Init is specified in the standard for just this reason. How does it work? Because the header is included before any of your code, the __foo object is constructed before any of your objects. (Global objects are built in the order in which they are declared, and destroyed in reverse order.) The first time the constructor runs, the eight stream objects are set up. My question: when I include the header file <iostream> in several .cpp files, how does the scheme above guarantees that there will be just one definition for the objects cin, cout, etc... ?
@CODE:<iostream> <istream> <ostream> #include <ostream>

@TITLE:Web API in Flask
@CONTENT:I want to use Flask to create a web API for my application, but have some problems to make my flask app aware of my other objects. I want to use Flask in order to be able to interact with my application through http requests. So the whole flask application in my case is just an external API, and relies on a core application. Let's imagine that my flask application will have to perform database calls. To manage database calls in my application, I use a single object that connects to the db ans implements some kind of Queue. That means my core application running in the background has a reference to my db object in order to make db calls. This is done by giving a reference to my queue object to this core application. Now I want to be able to perform actions on the db using a flask application too. What is the correct way to pass a reference to this Queue object to my Flask application? If I define all my objects at module level, I have no way to interact with them afterwards, do I? All the example of Flask applications use Flask as the core of their system and define everything in their app on module level. How do I make Flask just a part of my app? Thx!

@TITLE:HTML5Boilerplate js structure
@CONTENT:I'm wondering if someone can check my understanding of what the intended purpose of HTML5Boilerplate js directories. I understand that main.js is where I'm expected to place all site specific javascript that I author. Plugins.js is where I would place all jQuery plugins used. Both main.js and plugins.js will be concatenated and minified by the build process. Vendor.js holds javascript libraries. This directory will be minified (unless it is already minified) but not concatenated. If this is true, then my question is where should something like cute slider which has a modular structure be placed? I'm thinking I want it to be minified and concatenated so it shouldn't go in the vendor directory. I don't believe I can add cuteslider's javascript to main.js or plugins.js without destroying it's modular structure. Should I create a new directory, and call it something like apps, to hold cuteslider code and then modify the build code to minified and concatenated it? Here is a snippet of cuteslider's code structure cute

I had the idea that profilers instrument all the classes' bytecode and insert hooks that call via sockets info to a given program's open-point, so establishing a communication with the profiler. Is this the standard approach? Do they differ considerably in approach? Thanks

 But when I change it to the following, I get an error: Array type char is not assignable. char a[10];

 Why is array type char not assignable? Is it because the language is written that way on purpose or am I missing a point?

If array is one-quarter full I create a new array of half the size, and copy items. This is fairly fast algorithm for dynamic memory allocation despite the extra over-head of copying the elements to the newly allocated array.

@TITLE:How does the scheme below garantees there'll be just one definition for the objects cin, cout, K?
@CONTENT:Here you'll find the following statements under Which header ? : Finally, <iostream> provides the eight standard global objects (cin, cout, etc). To do this correctly, this header also provides the contents of the <istream> and <ostream> headers, but nothing else. The contents of this header look like #include <ostream>
#include <istream>

namespace std
{
    extern istream cin;
    extern ostream cout;
    ....

    // this is explained below
    static ios_base::Init __foo;    // not its real name
}
 Now, the runtime penalty mentioned previously: the global objects must be initialized before any of your own code uses them; this is guaranteed by the standard. Like any other global object, they must be initialized once and only once. This is typically done with a construct like the one above, and the nested class ios_base::Init is specified in the standard for just this reason. How does it work? Because the header is included before any of your code, the __foo object is constructed before any of your objects. (Global objects are built in the order in which they are declared, and destroyed in reverse order.) The first time the constructor runs, the eight stream objects are set up. My question: when I include the header file <iostream> in several .cpp files, how does the scheme above guarantees that there will be just one definition for the objects cin, cout, etc... ?
@CODE:<iostream> <istream> <ostream> #include <ostream>
#include <istream>

@CONTENT:I want to use Flask to create a web API for my application, but have some problems to make my flask app aware of my other objects. I want to use Flask in order to be able to interact with my application through http requests. So the whole flask application in my case is just an external API, and relies on a core application. Let's imagine that my flask application will have to perform database calls. To manage database calls in my application, I use a single object that connects to the db ans implements some kind of Queue. That means my core application running in the background has a reference to my db object in order to make db calls. This is done by giving a reference to my queue object to this core application. Now I want to be able to perform actions on the db using a flask application too. What is the correct way to pass a reference to this Queue object to my Flask application? If I define all my objects at module level, I have no way to interact with them afterwards, do I? All the example of Flask applications use Flask as the core of their system and define everything in their app on module level. How do I make Flask just a part of my app? Thx!

@TITLE:Can Git ignore files that has the same content but updated timestamp
@CONTENT:I'm using FTP in my recent web project. And I try use git to keep a local backup of all the changes on the FTP. It seems that the FTP server failed to support MFMT command (or some other thing I got wrong), the downloaded files do not preserve their timestamps. When I do a git diff with the newly downloaded files, Git marks every files as changed. Is there anyway I can tell Git to commit based on the diff result instead of the timestamp?

@TITLE:Using HashSet<int> to create an integer set
@CONTENT:I want to create an class that represents an integer set using a HashSet<int>. I want it to keep track of which values are included in the set using that internal container. I've done this so far: class SetInteger
{
    HashSet<int> intTest= new HashSet<int>();
    intTest.Add(1);
    intTest.Add(2);
    intTest.Add(3);
    intTest.Add(4);

    intTest.Add(6);
    intTest.Add(7);
    intTest.Add(8);
    intTest.Add(9);
    intTest.Add(10);
}
 So, here I think I'm adding some values to the HashSet, but I dont see how this can keep track of which values that are included in the set. Any ideas?
@CODE:HashSet<int> class SetInteger
{
    HashSet<int> intTest= new HashSet<int>();
    intTest.Add(1);
    intTest.Add(2);
    intTest.Add(3);

@CONTENT:I want to know how to make a java JFrame start out maximised. I don't want it to be fullscreen (no window around it) I just want it to start out like a normal program such as a web browser. I already know about using: Dimension screenSize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();
 To get the screen size, but when you apply this Dimension to the JFrame it can still be dragged around even though it takes up almost all of the screen. You can press the maximse button to stop this but I would rather that the window started out maximised. Also, I fear for the effects that maximising the window would have upon the contents of the window. How do I go about doing this?

@TITLE:How to prevent orientation change for just a layout, not the whole screen/activity
@CONTENT:I would need a child layout (can be any layout, like FrameLayout or RelativeLayout) to ignore orientation change and remain always in landscape orientation. But not its parent or any other sibling layouts/views, they should change their orientation accordingly. Hence, I cannot use setRequestedOrientation() or android:screenOrientation="landscape". Or it will lock the orientation for the whole screen or the activity. I need to lock only just this single layout. My layout XML: RelativeLayout (Parent)
  TextView
    FrameLayout/RelativeLayout <-- this need to be locked

@TITLE:Comparing the Mersenne Twister in Java and matlab
@CONTENT:I'm comparing the mersenne twister in Java and matlab. I'm using the same seed in both. My problem is that when i print out ten numbers from each number generator (Mersenne Twister running in Java and Matlab respectively), the resulting output doesn't seem to match. The output data from the Matlab version prints out every second number from the program in Java. Java prints: 0.417, 0.997, 0.720, 0.932, 0.0001.. Matlab prints: 0.417, 0.720, 0.0001.. Can anyone point me in the right direction to figure out why this happens? Java: public class TestRand {
    static MersenneTwister r = new MersenneTwister(1);

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int ant = 10;
        float[] randt = new float[ant];

        for (int i = 0; i < ant; i++){
            randt[i] = r.nextFloat()*1;
            System.out.println(randt[i]);    
        }
        System.out.println("------------twist");
    }
}
 Matlab: s = RandStream('twister','Seed',1)
RandStream.setGlobalStream(s);

r = 1 .* rand(1,10);
 I am using the standard implementation of the Mersenne Twister in MatLab, the Java-version I am using can be found here
@CODE:public class TestRand {
    static MersenneTwister r = new MersenneTwister(1);

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int ant = 10;
        float[] randt = new float[ant];

        for (int i = 0; i < ant; i++){
            randt[i] = r.nextFloat()*1;
            System.out.println(randt[i]);    
        }
        System.out.println("------------twist");
    }
} s = RandStream('twister','Seed',1)
RandStream.setGlobalStream(s);

r = 1 .* rand(1,10);

@TITLE:ELMAH: Elmah pages not styled making them difficult to read
@CONTENT:Setup: I have ELMAH installed via NuGet on an ASP.NET MVC 4 site. On the dev machine the app is installed at the root. It all works and is styled as ELMAH pages usually are. It always does that, work on the dev machine I mean, doesn't it? But on the server, the app installed in a sub folder (~/tracker). Although ELMAH works fine, the pages are unstyled, making them difficult to read. Question: What do I need to do to get the pages to style? Presumably, the styling comes from a resource that can be configured in the web.config. But how? Edit: I have found that I am getting a highly relevant error: System.Web.HttpException: A public action method 'stylesheet' was not found on controller 'Elmah.Mvc.ElmahController'.
 The path is given as: /tracker/elmah/stylesheet
 This is obviously related to the Link tag in the source of the ELMAH pages: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tracker/elmah/stylesheet" />
 But how do I configure this url?
@CODE:System.Web.HttpException: A public action method 'stylesheet' was not found on controller 'Elmah.Mvc.ElmahController'. /tracker/elmah/stylesheet <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tracker/elmah/stylesheet" />

@TITLE:Starting a jar with double click starts in 32bit JVM, but from console in 64bit JVM
@CONTENT:Since I'm using native libraries I have different JARs for 32bit and 64bit platforms. Now when there are two JVMs installed on the system, one 32bit and one 64bit I face this behaviour: Double clicking the 32bit JAR -> works Double clicking the 64bit JAR -> App doesn't start Starting the 32bit JAR from console -> Error: This Java instance does not support a 32-bit JVM.Please install the desired version. Starting the 64bit JAR from console -> works On Mac I can start the 32bit JAR from console, when adding -d32 to the command. But on Windows, this doesn't work. I expect, that on a system, where a 64bit JVM is installed, the JAR should start in 64bit JVM, no matter if started by double click or via console. I there a way to accomplish that?

@TITLE:When pushing branches and tags, get error: cannot spawn git: no such file or directory
@CONTENT:I have an existing, bare, Git repository created from importing our source and history from CVS. I make a mirror, using: git clone --mirror git://aserver.adomain.com/myrepo
 Then, I want to push all branches and tags to our internal Git repo host, but the push doesn't seem to see the bare repository as a Git repo. I have tried the following: git clone --mirror git://aserver.adomain.com/myrepo
git remote set-url origin http://user@anotherserver.adomain.com/project/myrepo.git
git push origin
 which results in: $ git push origin

user@SOMEMACHINE /some/path/myrepo.git (BARE:master)
$ git push --all mygithost
Password for 'xxxx':
error: cannot spawn git: No such file or directory
 What is the meaning of "cannot spawn git"? How can I push a bare repo, with all branches, to an empty existing one? I have googled several possibilities and reviewed several SO issues, but I don't see a solution to this problem. Clearly, my understanding of this process is flawed. Update I guess my understanding was not flawed. The error somehow misled me to think that there was something wrong with the bare repository, as I could clone and push branch by branch just fine from "regular" clones. As it turns out, this is a bug in MSysGit. I moved to Linux because retaining all of the history was a requirement, in my case. I couldn't simply remove branches and tags, as these needed to be pushed to the empty remote repo. So, the following did work: $ git remote rm origin
$ git clone --mirror git://aserver.adomain.com/myrepo
$ cd /some/path/myrepo.git
$ git remote add mygithost http://user@anotherserver.adomain.com/project/myrepo.git

Summary: Python Interpreter base package
Description:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language, and is
often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme, or Java.  You can find an overview
of Python in the documentation and tutorials included in the python-doc
(HTML) or python-doc-pdf (PDF) packages.

This package contains all of stand-alone Python files, minus binary
modules that would pull in extra dependencies. patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts 12.1-25.21.1.x86_64

@TITLE:Retrieve data from a website via Visual Basic
@CONTENT:There is this website that we purchase widgets from that provides details for each of their parts on its own webpage. Example: http://www.digikey.ca/product-search/en?lang=en&site=ca&KeyWords=AE9912-ND. I have to find all of their parts that are in our database, and add Manufacturer and Manufacturer Part Number values to their fields. I was told that there is a way for Visual Basic to access a webpage and extract information. If someone could point me in the right direction on where to start, I'm sure I can figure this out. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to select Document Mode in Firefox and Chrome without setting a DOCTYPE?
@CONTENT:I am working on converting a web page that was creating using old web standards to support modern web browsers. The web page currently renders in Quirks Mode within Internet Explorer 9, Firefox, and Chrome. In IE9, I am able to select the "Document Mode" in which I would like the web page I am viewing to render in. This makes things easier, as I can jump between Quirks Mode and IE9 Standards Mode. I do not have to add/modify the DOCTYPE tag within the code of the web page. Can I do the same in Firefox and Chrome?

@TITLE:Measuring server response time (client-side) [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Find out how long an Ajax request took to complete 3 answers I would like to implement a script that would measure the response time of my server (= remote url) from a client using a regular browser without any extra plugins (Java etc.). I'm only looking at the network speed (response time), not the page loading speed. What would you recommend me to measure? It has to run on tcp/ip, not anything else like ICMP (ping). How would you go around the implementation on the client side? I would prefer to use JavaScript (JQuery). Update: As I need a cross domain check, the ajax calls don't seem to be an option Furthermore, the ajax method doesn't seem to precise at all. Results seem to have an overhead of about 50ms (it's almost a constant value, no matter what the domain is - I guess it's the processing time in between) on the testing machine in comparison to information from FireBug

@TITLE:Encoding NSViewController for Lion's user interface resume feature
@CONTENT:Any idea what are the best practices for archiving an NSViewController inside a window for resume (user interface preservation) purposes? I've tried archiving it in the window controller's encodeRestorableStateWithCoder: methods only to find out that the view controller doesn't get unarchived when restoreStateWithCoder: is called. // NSWindowController subclass

-(void)encodeRestorableStateWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder
{
    [super encodeRestorableStateWithCoder:coder];
    NSViewController* contentViewController = self.contentViewController;
    if (contentViewController) {
        [coder encodeObject:contentViewController forKey:BSContentViewControllerResumeKey];

}

-(void)restoreStateWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder
{
    [super restoreStateWithCoder:coder];
    NSViewController* contentViewController = [coder decodeObjectForKey:BSContentViewControllerResumeKey];
    if (contentViewController) {
        // somehow this never get executed since contentViewController always comes out nil
        self.contentViewController = contentViewController;
    }
}
 Note that this view controller contains other view controllers that manages their own subviews, and thus will need some scoping in the NSCoder instance V simply passing the provided coder object downwards will cause name clashes in the archive. Thanks in advance!

 I did find this workaround (which works for me): if RUBY_VERSION =~ /1.9/
  Encoding.default_external = Encoding::UTF_8
  Encoding.default_internal = Encoding::UTF_8
end
 But I think that later it causes a different error so I'd rather not use it and just try to understand what's really wrong here. I know for sure this same code works on a different system...

When I start the hubconnection on the other pc I don't get a connectionId. I tried to change the url to my IP-Address without effect. Browser call to hub works but the Application doesn't work. The call looks like this: private bool tryToConnectToCoffeService()
    {
        try
        {
            this.hubConnection = new HubConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["coffeeConnection"].ConnectionString);

            this.hubConnection.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials;

            this.coffeeService = this.hubConnection.CreateHubProxy("coffee");

            this.hubConnection.Start();

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(hubConnection.ConnectionId))
            {
                return false;
            }

            return true;
        }
        catch(Exception ex)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
 The Global.asax: public class Global : System.Web.HttpApplication
{

    protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        RouteTable.Routes.MapHubs();
    }
 The hub like this [HubName("coffee")]
public class CoffeeHub : Hub
{
 My Hub Connection String is this: "http://pcthi-and:8080/"
 Or: "http://My-Current-IP-Address:8080/"
 I use SignalR 1.0 rc2. Does anyone have an idea? Thanks for helping. Cheers Frank

@CONTENT:I'm creating an ASP.NET MVC 4 app using the service stack MVC powerpack, utilizing service stack's auth and session providers. I'm copying lot of logic from the social bootstrap API project.

 which is implemented as: public class ControllerBase : ServiceStackController<CustomUserSession> {}
 CustomUserSession inherits from AuthUserSession: public class CustomUserSession : AuthUserSession
 After I log in, my CustomUserSession OnAuthenticated() method runs, but when I redirect back to my controller, the UserSession is not populated, e.g. public override void OnAuthenticated(IServiceBase authService, IAuthSession session, IOAuthTokens tokens, Dictionary<string, string> authInfo)
{
    base.OnAuthenticated(authService, session, tokens, authInfo);
    CustomFoo = "SOMETHING CUSTOM";

@TITLE:Adding a field to an empty struct
@CONTENT:Assuming I have a struct S of size 0x1 with the fields a and b, what is the most elegant way to add a field c to it? Usually I am able to do it like this: S = struct('a',0,'b',0); %1x1 struct with fields a,b
S.c = 0
 However, if I receive an empty struct this does not work anymore: S = struct('a',0,'b',0);
S(1) = []; % 0x1 struct with fields a,b
S.c = 0;
% A dot name structure assignment is illegal when the structure is empty.  
% Use a subscript on the structure.
 I have thought of two ways to deal with this, but both are quite ugly and feel like workarounds rather than solutions. (Note the possibility of a non-empty struct should also be dealt with properly). Adding something to the struct to ensure it is not empty, adding the field, and making the struct empty again Initializing a new struct with the required fieldnames, filling it with the data from the original struct, and overwriting the original struct I realize that it may be odd that I care about empty structs, but unfortunately part of the code that is not managed by me will crash if the fieldname does not exist. I have looked at help struct, help subsasgn and also searched for the given error message but so far I have not yet found any hints. Help is therefore much appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/14828476/confusion-about-using-stdless-and-stdgreater-with-stdsort
@TITLE:confusion about using std::less and std::greater with std::sort
@CONTENT:In C, sort usually implements as in the following example: #include <stdio.h>

void Sort( int* arr, int n, bool(*cmp)(int,int) )
{
    for( int i=0; i<n-1; i++ )
    {
        for( int j=i+1; j<n; j++ )
        {
            if( cmp(arr[i], arr[j]) )
                swap( arr[i], arr[j] );
        }
    }
}

int ascending( int a, int b ) { return a > b; }    // greater
int descending( int a, int b ) { return a < b; }   // less

void main()
{
    int arr[10] = { 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10 };

    // ascending
    Sort( arr, 10, ascending );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        printf( "%d ", arr[i] );

    printf( "\n" );


    // descending
    Sort( arr, 10, descending );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        printf( "%d ", arr[i] );

    printf( "\n" );
}
 So I wrote some source as in the following example, expecting same result: #include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>    // for sort
#include <functional>   // for less & greater
using namespace std;

bool gt( int a, int b ) { return a > b; }   // greater
bool ls( int a, int b ) { return a < b; }   // less

void main()
{
    int x[10] = { 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10 };

    // ascending but descending
    sort( x, x+10, gt );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        cout << x[i] << " ";

    cout << endl;

    // descending but ascending
    sort( x, x+10, ls );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        cout << x[i] << " ";

    cout << endl;


    greater<int> g; // a > b
    less<int> l;    // a < b

    // ascending but descending
    sort( x, x+10, g );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        cout << x[i] << " ";

    cout << endl;

    // descending but ascending
    sort( x, x+10, l );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        cout << x[i] << " ";

    cout << endl;
}
 But my expectation was not correct. Why does not sort in STL work like sort in C?
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>

void Sort( int* arr, int n, bool(*cmp)(int,int) )
{
    for( int i=0; i<n-1; i++ )
    {
        for( int j=i+1; j<n; j++ )
        {
            if( cmp(arr[i], arr[j]) )
                swap( arr[i], arr[j] );
        }
    }
}

int ascending( int a, int b ) { return a > b; }    // greater
int descending( int a, int b ) { return a < b; }   // less

void main()
{
    int arr[10] = { 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10 };

    // ascending
    Sort( arr, 10, ascending );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        printf( "%d ", arr[i] );

    printf( "\n" );


    // descending
    Sort( arr, 10, descending );
    for( int i=0; i<10; i++ )
        printf( "%d ", arr[i] );

    printf( "\n" );
} #include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>    // for sort
#include <functional>   // for less & greater
using namespace std;

bool gt( int a, int b ) { return a > b; }   // greater
bool ls( int a, int b ) { return a < b; }   // less

void main()
{
    int x[10] = { 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10 };

@TITLE:C++ casting a floating point value to an enum - but not with VS 2010
@CONTENT:I have some template code that works fine with Xcode 4.5 and LLVM 3.0, but fails with the VS 2010 Express C++ toolchain (v 10.0.30319.1). I'm using a third-party API that I have no control over. It provides values to my code as black-box 'blobs' that can only be interpreted by API functions: // API_Secret is a black-box encapsulation of a floating-point number or a boolean value.
// It is provided by a third-party API, with associated access functions.
// For all intents and purposes, it's a complete black box.
// This enum represents the internal 'type' of a secret value.
enum API_SecretTypeEnum {
  API_Number,
  API_Boolean,
};
// Other API declarations:
API_SecretTypeEnum API_GetType(const API_Secret &value);
double API_AsNumber(const API_Secret &value);
bool API_AsBoolean(const API_Secret &value);

// my code:
template <typename ValueType>
class Extractor {
 public:
  ValueType extract(API_Secret value) {
    if (API_GetType(value) == API_Number) {
      return static_cast<ValueType>(API_AsNumber(value));
    } else if (API_GetType(value) == API_Boolean) {
      return API_AsBoolean(value) ? ValueType(1) : ValueType(0);
    }
    return ValueType();
  }
};

// boolean specialization - not 100% sure it's needed though
template<>
class Extractor <bool> {
 public:
  bool extract(API_Secret value) {
    return API_AsBoolean(value);
  }
};
 Then, later: API_Secret API_GetSomeValue(int some_sort_of_handle);

// get some black-box values from the API
API_Secret secret0 = API_GetSomeValue(0);
API_Secret secret1 = API_GetSomeValue(1);
API_Secret secret2 = API_GetSomeValue(2);

// for certain external reasons we expect this to be an integer representation:
Extractor<int> e0;
int v0 = e0.extract(secret0);

// for certain external reasons we expect this to be a double representation:
Extractor<double> e1;
double v1 = e1.extract(secret1);

// for certain external reasons we expect this to be a boolean representation:
Extractor<bool> e2;
bool v2 = e2.extract(secret2);
 Now for the difference between Xcode, LLVM and VS 2010. In Xcode & LLVM, the following will compile (as part of the full program): enum MyEnum {
  Enum0,
  Enum1,
};
Extractor<MyEnum> ee;
MyEnum ve = ee.extract(secret0);
 I.e. the class template uses a static_cast to convert from a floating point number to an enum. This seems to work fine, and the explanation section of this page suggests this is valid: 8) Integer, floating-point, or enumeration type can be converted to any enumeration type (the result is unspecified if the value of expression, converted to the enumeration's underlying type, is not one of the target enumeration values) However with VS2010, the following compiler error is encountered: error C2440: 'static_cast' : cannot convert from 'double' to 'MyEnum'      Conversions between enumeration and floating point values are no longer allowed
 And this MSDN article seems to confirm this by not mentioning floating-point types and explicitly stating 'integral' value: The static_cast operator can explicitly convert an integral value to an enumeration type. If the value of the integral type does not fall within the range of enumeration values, the resulting enumeration value is undefined. So it appears that there is a significant difference here between VS 2010 and the other compilers. I am wondering whether this is something that can be bypassed in VS 2010? Is it a newer feature of the language that VS 2010 simply doesn't support? However I query this as the error message says "no longer allowed", implying it's explicitly disallowed. I know of a workaround - instead of casting to an enum (with Extractor<MyEnum>), I can use an Extractor<int> instead, and then simply assign this to the target MyEnum variable. However this template is actually used as part of a larger system that calls wrapped functions, and in this case the wrapped function takes a MyEnum value. This prevents the template from matching properly as the ValueType parameter is actually picked up automatically from the signature of the wrapped function. Alternatively, is it possible to write a template specialization of Extractor that matches enum types only? Then I can cast to an integral type first. Or maybe the base template could always cast to an int first, then I could write a floating-point specialization that doesn't do this - but I'm not sure how to write a template that catches all floating-point types (float, double, ...).
@CODE:// API_Secret is a black-box encapsulation of a floating-point number or a boolean value.
// It is provided by a third-party API, with associated access functions.
// For all intents and purposes, it's a complete black box.
// This enum represents the internal 'type' of a secret value.
enum API_SecretTypeEnum {
  API_Number,
  API_Boolean,
};
// Other API declarations:
API_SecretTypeEnum API_GetType(const API_Secret &value);
double API_AsNumber(const API_Secret &value);
bool API_AsBoolean(const API_Secret &value);

// my code:
template <typename ValueType>
class Extractor {

  ValueType extract(API_Secret value) {
    if (API_GetType(value) == API_Number) {
      return static_cast<ValueType>(API_AsNumber(value));
    } else if (API_GetType(value) == API_Boolean) {
      return API_AsBoolean(value) ? ValueType(1) : ValueType(0);
    }
    return ValueType();
  }
};

// boolean specialization - not 100% sure it's needed though
template<>
class Extractor <bool> {
 public:
  bool extract(API_Secret value) {
    return API_AsBoolean(value);
  }
}; API_Secret API_GetSomeValue(int some_sort_of_handle);

// get some black-box values from the API
API_Secret secret0 = API_GetSomeValue(0);
API_Secret secret1 = API_GetSomeValue(1);
API_Secret secret2 = API_GetSomeValue(2);

@CONTENT:I have written a .java file, called Main.java, and have compiled it using the javac in the Windows Command Prompt. The compiler is creating multiple .class files (called Main.class, Main$1.class, & Main$2.class--presumably because I have anonymous inner classes in my Main.java file). I am trying to create a runnable .jar file so I can double click a shortcut to run this application (it is a Java Swing application), but I am unsuccessful when I navigate to the directory of the three class files and type: jar cfv file.jar Main.class Main$1.class Main$2.class
 The Command Prompt then outputs this text: added manifest

@TITLE:jQuery UI's Draggable and page scrolling
@CONTENT:I noticed when I use jQuery UI's draggable feature and I have to drag the element so far up/down the page that it forces a scroll. The element being dragged seems to jump (about) twice as fast as my mouse cursor. This causes very erratic behavior and makes it almost impossible to use. An example of what I mean can be found here. http://tinyurl.com/ae6g5qe I even get this behavior on the sample code on the jQuery UI's site. http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#scroll I have a guess that it is using both the mouse movement AND the window scroll to increase the movement of the element (So twice as much). I'm about to delve into jQuery UI's code and see if I can find anything, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this or if it is just me? Also, if anyone has - have you gotten around it somehow?

 And I am supposed to insert in all the three tables or any one of them using JDBC. Below are the three use cases I have- From the command prompt if suppose I am passing Table1 only, then I am suppose to insert only in Table1 columns by making connection to Table1. And if I am passing Table1, Table2 from the command prompt then I am suppose to insert in both Table1 and Table2 columns by making connection to Table1 and Table2. And if I am passing Table1, Table2 and Table3 then I am suppose to enter in all the three tables using there respective connection parameter I am not able to understand how to write code for the above particular scenario in such a cleaner way so that it can be extended in near future as well if I come up with four tables. I can have a one constant file which can store the SQL that needs to be executed for any of the three tables and some other constant thing as well. public static void main(String[] args) {


}


 class Task implements Runnable {

    private Connection dbConnection = null;
    private PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;

    public Task() {

    }

    @Override
    public void run() {

    dbConnection = getDbConnection();

    //prepare the statement and execute it

    }
  }


    private Connection getDBConnection() {

    Connection dbConnection = null;

          Class.forName(Constants.DRIVER_NAME);
      dbConnection = DriverManager.getConnection( , , );

      return dbConnection;
    }
 Can anyone provide some thoughts on this how should I proceed forward? Note:- Column in each table will differ a lot. Like in some tables, column can be 10 and in some other table, column can be 20.

@TITLE:Checking for violations of android:minSdkVersion automatically
@CONTENT:I'm working on an android app, and worried that we have introduced code that uses functionality from API levels later than its minSdkVersion. I'd like to know if there's any way to detect some of these violations automatically. In this app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it specifies: <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="8"
          android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
 ndk-build is seems to be giving me a warning about this (or is this warning for another reason?): Android NDK: Found stable platform levels: 14 3 4 5 8 9

 While I realize any tool cannot be 100% accurate due to runtime dispatch, other than: a full audit of the source code, or a complete testing of all code paths on a device running minSdkVersion (in this case android-8 = 2.2 = Froyo) ...is there a lint-like tool, a build setting change, or anything else I can use to identify at least the most obvious/blatant violations? If no such thing exists, is there a comprehensive API list or something that will make an audit easier?

@CONTENT:I have data as follows: 10 states Each state has two types Each type has between 1 and 29 entities Each state-entity-type has a count Complete data available as a gist. I'm trying to visualize what proportion of the counts were made for each entity. To do that, I've used the following code: icc <- transform( icc, state=factor(state), entity=factor(entity), type=factor(type) )
p <- ggplot( icc, aes( x=state, y=count, fill=entity ) ) +
  geom_bar( stat="identity", position="stack" ) +
  facet_grid( type ~ . )
custom_theme <- theme_update(legend.position="none")
p
 Unfortunately, I'm losing a lot of information because state-types with lots of entities aren't displaying enough unique colors. As mentioned above, I have 125 entities, but the most entities in a state-type is 29. Is there a way to force ggplot2 and colorbrewer to assign a unique (and hopefully fairly distinct) color within each entity-type? The only way I've come up with so far is to coerce entity to an integer, which works but doesn't provide much color differentiation between levels.
@CODE:icc <- transform( icc, state=factor(state), entity=factor(entity), type=factor(type) )
p <- ggplot( icc, aes( x=state, y=count, fill=entity ) ) +

@TITLE:Pix, A couple of issues I'm not understanding
@CONTENT:I've been asked to split questions which I asked here: HLSL and Pix number of questions I thought two and three would both fit in the same question as a solution of one may help resolve the other. I'm trying to debug a shader and seem to be running into issues. Firstly Pix seems to be skipping a large amount of code when I'm running analyse mode. This is analysing an experiment with F12 captures and with D3DX analysis turned off. I have to turn it off as I'm using XNA. The shader code in question is below: float4 PixelShaderFunction(float2 OriginalUV : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0
{   

    // Get the depth buffer value at this pixel.  
    float4 color = float4 (0, 0,0,0);
    float4 finalColor = float4(0,0,0,0);

    float zOverW = tex2D(mySampler, OriginalUV);  
    // H is the viewport position at this pixel in the range -1 to 1.  
    float4 H = float4(OriginalUV.x * 2 - 1, (1 - OriginalUV.y) * 2 - 1,  
    zOverW, 1);  
    // Transform by the view-projection inverse.  
    float4 D = mul(H, xViewProjectionInverseMatrix);  
    // Divide by w to get the world position.  
    float4 worldPos = D / D.w;  

    // Current viewport position  
    float4 currentPos = H;  
    // Use the world position, and transform by the previous view-  
    // projection matrix.  
    float4 previousPos = mul(worldPos, xPreviousViewProjectionMatrix);  
    // Convert to nonhomogeneous points [-1,1] by dividing by w.  
    previousPos /= previousPos.w;  
    // Use this frame's position and last frame's to compute the pixel  
       // velocity.  
    float2 velocity = (currentPos - previousPos)/2.f;  

    // Get the initial color at this pixel.  
    color = tex2D(sceneSampler, OriginalUV);  
    OriginalUV += velocity;  
    for(int i = 1; i < 1; ++i, OriginalUV += velocity)  
    {  
        // Sample the color buffer along the velocity vector.  
        float4 currentColor = tex2D(sceneSampler, OriginalUV);  
        // Add the current color to our color sum.  
        color += currentColor;  
    } 
    // Average all of the samples to get the final blur color.  
    finalColor = color / xNumSamples;  


    return finalColor;
}
 With a captured frame and when debugging a pixel I can only see two lines working. These are color = tex2D(sceneSampler, OriginalUV) and finalColor = color / xNumSamples. The rest of it Pix just skips or doesn't do. Also can I debug in real time using Pix? I'm wondering if this method would reveal more information. Cheers,

 Can someone please help me get the selected item binding hooked up properly. The combobox displays all the right items, but they do not bind to the EmployeeSelection.idStatus. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Setting a single row of a CellRendererToggle to inconsistent
@CONTENT:On Gtk+3, I'm using a TreeModel to store nested information and I display it with a CellRendererText and a CellRendererToggle. The user can clic on every toggle button, and when there are nested ones and they are not in the same state, I want the ones of upper level to reflect the 'inconsistent' state. How can I set this property for one element ? For more clarity, an example of what I?want to achieve from the Transmission bittorrent client : I know how to set all the buttons of the cell renderer to the inconsistent state with myCellRendererToggle.set_properties(inconsistent=True) but it seems I can't access one single element from here; I know how to access a particular row of my TreeStore model, but I can only set ?True? and ?False? values. My code is fairly close to the official documentation so you can help me with it : https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cellrenderers.html#cellrenderertoggle (I use a treeStore instead of a listStore) And this is my code : class HelloMyApp:

 Thanks ! edit :?to answer Marcus : I can't figure it out, when I?change the property of my CellRendererToggle inside the function, it changes every row. edit for the solution : as Marcu pointed out, we have to set the property in every case, that's why I?added the else part. def cellRenderer_func(column, cellRenderer, treeModel, treeIter, userData):
    if 'cat' in treeModel.get_value(treeIter, 0): 
        # it happens only ones in my model,

        cellRenderer.set_property('inconsistent',True)

    else:

 I am having a hard time finding a cure for this ailment... I have created unit tests for dot net test projects. With the default unit test framework. The automated tool created an accessor - which would be used for testing private methods. [ I know the theory, private methods should be tested through their callers - but then, it depends on their purpose, content, context and so on... so if I can, I will test them.] I have done this in the past on a couple of projects, and it worked fine. But on these two projects I am trying to test now, I am running into this problem... Note: I am using Framework 3.5 - that may be an issue ? - but the accessor should know that ! I see absolutely nowhere where I can modify the runtime for the assembly... which I imagine is the accessor. And yes, I did clean and rebuild, I did completely erase the output folder and rebuilt, I did delete the accessor and private method and re-create it. Please help me find how to fix this ! Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/14757474/how-to-store-universal-references
@TITLE:How to store universal references
@CONTENT:I need to store universal references inside a class (I am sure the referenced values will outlive the class). Is there a canonical way of doing so? Here is a minimal example of what I have come up with. It seems to work, but I'm not sure if I got it right. template <typename F, typename X>
struct binder
{
    template <typename G, typename Y>
    binder(G&& g, Y&& y) : f(std::forward<G>(g)), x(std::forward<Y>(y)) {}

binder<F&&, X&&> bind(F&& f, X&& x)

    bind(f, i)();   // X&& is int&
    bind(f, j)();   // X&& is const int&
    bind(f, 3)();   // X&& is int&&
}
 Is my reasoning correct or will this lead to subtle bugs? Also, is there a better (i.e., more concise) way to write the constructor? binder(F&& f, X&& x) will not work, since those are r-value references, thus disallowing binder(f, i).
@CODE:template <typename F, typename X>

{

@TITLE:Copy-initialization of simple RAII wrapper with lambda fails unexpectedly under GCC and Clang
@CONTENT:I've come across an unexpected problem while creating a trivial RAII wrapper. Let alone the logical incompleteness of the code below (copy-constructor and assignment operator not deleted etc., this is meant to be an SSCCE), what strikes me is that copy-initialization of my wrapper with a temporary lambda results in a compilation error, while direct-initialization does not. This behavior can be observed both on GCC 4.7.2 and on Clang 3.2, while ICC 13.0.1 and VC10 compile both versions without problems. #include <iostream>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;

struct A

    template<typename F>
    A(F&& f) : _f(forward<F>(f)) { }

private:

};

int main()
{
    // A a = [] () { cout << "Hello" << endl; }; // ERROR!
    A a([] () { cout << "Hello" << endl; }); // OK

 Who is right, and what is the problem with those who are wrong? Is it an issue with the implementation of the C++ Standard Library, or rather a compiler issue? References to the C++11 Standard are particularly welcome. EDIT: Here is the error produced by Clang 3.2: Compilation finished with errors:

@TITLE:Compiling Regular Expressions in Python
@CONTENT:I'm working through Doug Hellman's "The Python Standard Library by Example" and came across this: "1.3.2 Compiling Expressions re includes module-level functions for working with regular expressions as text strings, but it is more efficient to compile the expressions a program uses frequently." I couldn't follow his explanation for why this is the case. He says that the "module-level functions maintain a cache of compiled expressions" and that since the "size of the cache" is limited, "using compiled expressions directly avoids the cache lookup overhead." I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could please explain or direct me to an explanation that I could better understand for why it is more efficient to compile the regular expressions a program uses frequently, and how this process actually works.

@TITLE:The parallel data warehouse (PDW) features are not enabled
@CONTENT:I have a WinForms client application that executes the following SQL statement with parameters. SELECT a.CaseNo, (c.Claimant + ' -v- ' + c.Defendant) AS CaseName, 
       a.Allocation - ISNULL(LAG(a.Allocation) 
       OVER (PARTITION BY a.CaseNo, a.FeeEarner ORDER BY a.AllocID), 0) AS Billing, a.AllocID

WHERE a.CaseNo > 0 AND FeeEarner = @FeeEarner 
AND a.Date >= @StartDate 
AND a.Date <= @EndDate ORDER BY a.Date;
 When I run this on my laptop where I do my development work, the query executes with no issues. The information returned is used to populate a datagrid within the client application. I am using SQL Server 2012 Express. However, when the exact same client application is run at my customer's premises the code returns an error. The majority of the error message is generated by my application which simply enables me to pinpoint where in the code the problem arises. However, at the end of the message where I append the system generated error, I get the following: The parallel data warehouse (PDW) features are not enabled
 I have never seen this message before and so am at a loss to determine what the problem is. I tried Google searches for this error message but have not found anything useful. My customer is using SQL Server 2008 R2 Express. Is PDW a feature in SQL Express 2012 that isn't in the 2008 R2 version? What is it about my query that requires PDW? Is it the use of PARTITION, because that is a keyword I had not used previously until this query which is causing the issues? Without getting the customer to change their SQL version is there any way to address this problem e.g. by changing my SQL query, or enabling something in SQL? Any help would be most appreciated.

 Is it possible to do? Is WPF WebBrowser control very limited to execute local web page with ActiveX? Any clue? P.S. I've tried to do the same with WInForm WebBrowser control - no joy...

 But sadly, I was not using my database with this one but instead I just wrote it straight in a php file. EDIT Anyways, moving on. I have modified my code and ended up like this. <?PHP
    $consoleQuery = "SELECT * ".
    "FROM consoleConsole ".
        "JOIN consoleModel ".
                "ON consoleConsole.consoleId = consoleModel.consoleId ".
            "JOIN consoleGame ".
                "ON consoleModel.modelId = consoleGame.gameId";

$consoleResult = mysql_query($consoleQuery);

$consoleFields = array_fill_keys(array(
    'consoleName',
    ), null);

$modelFields = array_fill_keys(array(
    'modelName',
    ), null);

$console = array();
$rowConsole = array();

while ($rowConsole = mysql_fetch_assoc($consoleResult)) {
    $consoleId = $rowConsole['consoleId'];
    $modelId = $row['modelId'];
    if (isset($console[$consoleId]['Information'])) {
        $console[$consoleId]['Information'][] = array_intersect_key($rowConsole, $modelFields);
    }

    else {
        $console[$consoleId] = array_intersect_key($rowConsole, $consoleFields);
        $console[$consoleId]['Information'] = array(array_intersect_key($rowConsole, $modelFields));
    }
}

$console = array_values($console);
echo json_encode($console);

?>
 I was able to produce an output but it doesn't look like the output above. [
  {
    "consoleName": "PlayStation",
    "Information": [
      {
        "modelName": "PlayStation"

@TITLE:iOS Ad-Hoc OTA distribution works for iOS 6 and fails with iOS 5
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble with over the air (OTA) distribution for my Ad-Hoc builds. Building a universal iPhone/iPad app with base SDK 6.1, deployment target 5.0, architectures armv7 and armv7s. The very same ad-hoc build installs OTA on iOS 6 devices (3 different iPhone5, one iPhone4 and iPad2), but fails to install OTA on iOS 5 devices (iPhone4S and iPad1). The OTA happens via IIS with all MIME types set properly (otherwise it would fail for iOS 6). On iOS 5 devices it starts installation showin app icon with progress bar, first title is "Waiting...", then changes to app name, then alert view shows up saying Unable to Download Application could not be downloaded at this time. Done/Retry Connected device to Xcode to see logs in organizer. Console has the following: apsd[48] : : Stream error occurred for : Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=61 "The operation couldn-t -b-e -c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e-d-. -C-o-n-n-e-c-t-i-o-n -r-e-f-u-s-e-d-" -U-s-e-r-I-n-f-o-=-0-x-1-4-7-0-8-0 -{-} Exactly like that, including "-" characters. Installing same ad-hoc build on same iOS 5 devices via iTunes sync works as expected, no errors. Account type is a "plain" developer account, not Enterprise. I already tried to create all provisioning profiles from scratch. Didn't try to delete and create new certificates yet, hope it's not required. App does not use iCloud or Pushes, or anything. No Entitlements.plist is included into the bundle. Might be important to mention the fact that app is build with CocoaPods - a bunch of 3rd party libraries built as Pods target.

@TITLE:Can any third-party load embedded resources from my project?
@CONTENT:Please refer to one of my previous questions. I'm asking about loading a compiled resource from a DLL. Then refer to the answer by David Heffernan. His suggestion is to use a built-in mechanism to load a resource directly from the DLL's instance, without even using my own exported function. This pointed out a security loophole to me. If this is really the case, if this type of solution is possible, then can any outside third-party load resources from any Delphi Application/DLL? How secure are embedded resources? Suppose I compile a DLL with an embedded resource. Can someone take this DLL and extract the resource? How easy is it, considering they must know the resource name? Are they able to detect what resources are compiled and get a listing of named resources? If this is so, then I will have to implement my own level of security and encrypt every embedded resource and decrypt it with login.

@TITLE:Making a multipart post request with compressed jpeg byte array with spring for android
@CONTENT:I've been using spring for android successfully in my android app to get/post data from/to the server. Now, I have to do a post request for a multipart form, but I've been unable to get it working the way I want. Use case: 1. Pick a photo from the gallery 2. Load it to a bitmap using the file source 3. Compress the bitmap to a ByteArrayOutputStream 4. Pass the byte array ( ByteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray() ) to the server. (I need to send this as jpeg not application/octet-stream) The server endpoint for upload photo accepts a MultipartFile with only the following Mime types ( Note, it does not accept MimeType: application/octet-stream ): GIF("image/gif")
PNG("image/png", "image/x-png")
JPG("image/jpeg", "image/jpg", "image/pjpeg")
BMP("image/bmp")
 I've tried using the sample code, but been unsuccessful so far. With the following code I get the following error: org.springframework.web.bind.MissingServletRequest ParameterException: Required MultipartFile parameter 'file' is not present Help on this matter is greatly appreciated. Thanks and keep up the good work. Here's my code: bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile("/mnt/sdcard/DCIM/Camera/20130205_162546.jpg");

#include <set>


class a
{
public:
    ~a() 
    {}
std::set <int> myset;
};

int main()
{
a object;
object.myset.insert(55);
object.~a();
object.myset.insert(20);
std::cout << object.myset.size();
}
 I get: "* glibc detected * /.app: double free or corruption (fasttop):" and then "ABORT". If it matters I have c++11 flag enabled. So what does empty constructor actually do? It does something and I read it doesn't.
@CODE:#include <iostream>
#include <set>


class a
{
public:
    ~a() 
    {}
std::set <int> myset;
};

int main()
{
a object;
object.myset.insert(55);
object.~a();
object.myset.insert(20);
std::cout << object.myset.size();
} object.~a();

@LINK:/questions/14720110/understanding-virtual-copy-constructors
@TITLE:understanding virtual copy constructors
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble understanding what's really happening with the code in a book I'm using to learn C++. Here's the code: class Base
{
    public:
        Base() {};
        virtual ~Base() {};

        virtual Base* Clone() {return new Base(*this);}

class Derived
{
    public:
        Derived() {};
        virtual ~Derived() {};

        virtual Base* Clone() {return new Derived(*this);}
};
 So in this Clone() function I understand that the function returns a pointer to a Base class object. What I don't understand is what's happening within that function. When I've previously used new as in int *pInt = new int, I was under the impression that new essentially allocates enough memory on the free store for an integer, then returns that address, applying the address to the pointer pInt. With that same logic I'm trying to understand the new Derived(*this) portion of the code. So, I think it is allocating enough memory on the free store for a Derived class object, and returning the address, which is then returned by the function Clone(). Why, though, does it pass *this through the constructor, if that is a constructor? I understand *this means its passing the address of whatever object is being cloned, but I don't understand the syntax of class_name(address_of_an_object) in the context of the new function. Could someone please explain what's happening in that portion? Thanks in advance.
@CODE:class Base
{
    public:
        Base() {};
        virtual ~Base() {};

        virtual Base* Clone() {return new Base(*this);}
};

class Derived
{
    public:
        Derived() {};
        virtual ~Derived() {};

        virtual Base* Clone() {return new Derived(*this);}

@CONTENT:I have a MS SQL Server 2008 database on a shared hosting and I need to reduce the used storage space as much as possible. My largest table has the following definition: CREATE TABLE [stage](
    [station_id] [smallint] NOT NULL,
    [time_utc] [smalldatetime] NOT NULL,
    [stage_mm] [smallint] NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT [PK_stage] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([station_id] ASC,[time_utc] ASC)
 I tried to find out the average number of bytes per record in my table. According to theory the size should be: 4B (row header) + 2B (smallint) + 4B (smalldatetime) + 2B (smallint) which is 12 bytes. However, when I ran the command: dbcc showcontig ('stage') with tableresults
 It shows: MinimumRecordSize=15, MaximumRecordSize=15 So according to SQL Server, the bytes per record is 15 and not 12 The number 15 bytes per record seems also correct when I look at the total disk space taken by the table and divide it by number of rows. What is taking up the 3 extra bytes ???
@CODE:CREATE TABLE [stage](

So, I would rather build a multi-page app instead of a single page web app. Backbone.js provides me with the "structure" so my javascript does not turn into sphagetti mess. But , I'm completely clueless on how to build multi-page apps using Backbone. Do you include the main.js file on every page render? What about routes? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with modularizing, etc? I wish there was a tutorial on how to build multi-page javascript apps using Backbone.

@LINK:/questions/14712633/multiple-curl-requests-when-to-close-the-handle
@TITLE:multiple curl requests, when to close the handle?
@CONTENT:I'm confused with curl's init() and close() functions. I want to know when should I close the curl handle in each of these situations: 1. using a single handle to get a "single" URL, with different options. for example: $curl=curl_init('google.com');
curl_setopt($curl,CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,true);
curl_exec($curl);
 now i want to set FOLLOWLOCATION to false. should i do curl_close($curl), and do everything from the beginning, or just set the option and execute it again like this: curl_setopt($curl,CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,false);
curl_exec($curl);
 2.using a single handle to get "multiple" URLs. for example: $curl = curl_init('google.com');
curl_exec($curl);
 now i want to get stackoverflow.com. should i close the handle and start from the beginning or i can set another URL without closing the handle. like this: $curl = curl_init('stackoverflow.com');
curl_exec($curl);
 3.using a mulit handle to get mutltiple URLs. This is my code: $CONNECTIONS=10;
$urls=fopen('urls.txt','r');
while(!feof($urls))
{
   $curl_array=array();
   $curl=curl_multi_init();
   for($i=0;$i<$CONNECTIONS&&!feof($urls);$i++)             
            //create 10 connections unless we have reached end of file
   {
        $url=fgets($urls);                    //get next url from file
        $curl_array[$i]=curl_init($url);      
        curl_multi_add_handle($curl,$curl_array[$i]);
   }
   $running=NULL;
   do
   {
       curl_multi_exec($curl,$running);
   }while($running>0);
   for($i=0;$i<$CONNECTIONS;$i++)    
   {
       $response=curl_multi_getcontent($curl_array[$i]);
       curl_multi_remove_handle($curl,$curl_array[$i]);
       curl_close(($curl_array[$i]));
   }
   curl_multi_close($curl);
}
 As you can see: after getting the contents of each single handle, I'm removing the handle from the multi handle, closing the single handle, and then closing the multi handle after the for loop. Is this practice correct or I am OVERCLOSING the handles? thanks
@CODE:init() close() $curl=curl_init('google.com');

@TITLE:CTE vs. T-SQL loop for determining depth of object hierarchy
@CONTENT:I have a table consisting of about 70,000 rows and two columns (both VARCHAR(16)): id and parent_id. I'd like to populate a 'depth' column that shows how far a particular record is from the 'root' node. e.g. id,parent_id,depth
A,NULL,0
B,A,1
C,A,1
D,B,2
E,D,3
 etc. I started by writing a query based on this answer to a similar question: WITH myCTE(id, depth) AS
(
    SELECT id, 0 FROM objects where id = 'A'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT objects.id, depth + 1 FROM myCTE JOIN objects ON objects.parent_id = myCTE.id
)
SELECT id, depth FROM myCTE
 With my dataset (~80,000 rows) the above takes almost two hours to execute! I then wrote my query as a loop and got far better performance: ALTER TABLE objects ADD depth INT NULL
DECLARE @counter int
DECLARE @total int
SET @counter = 0
UPDATE objects SET depth = 0 WHERE id = 'A'

SELECT @total = COUNT(*) FROM objects WHERE depth IS NULL

WHILE (@total > 0)
BEGIN
    UPDATE objects SET depth = @counter + 1 WHERE parent_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM objects WHERE depth = @counter
    )
    SELECT @total = COUNT(*) FROM objects WHERE depth IS NULL
    SET @counter = @counter + 1
END
 The above code only takes a couple of minutes (and it has the benefit of adding the results to the existing table) My question is whether my results are typical of using a CTE for this problem or whether there is something I have overlooked that might explain it? Indexes, maybe? (I have none on the table right now)
@CODE:VARCHAR(16) id parent_id id,parent_id,depth
A,NULL,0
B,A,1
C,A,1
D,B,2
E,D,3 WITH myCTE(id, depth) AS

    SELECT id, 0 FROM objects where id = 'A'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT objects.id, depth + 1 FROM myCTE JOIN objects ON objects.parent_id = myCTE.id

SET @counter = 0
UPDATE objects SET depth = 0 WHERE id = 'A'

SELECT @total = COUNT(*) FROM objects WHERE depth IS NULL

Whatever the case, the column displays, but no data is produced. (And the page errors out when I try to sort). Any ideas on this? Update This post is an extension of this SO thread I've updated it to match the modules current status. That is, I'm adding columns to both sales_flat_order and sales_flat_order_grid. From that post, I've got an action that takes place to set this attribute value (after the order has been completed). My question at this point is - how does updateGridRecords() come into play? => updateGridRecords appears to be called automatically when the $order->save() gets called (something I'm doing manually after the order is complete). If I understand this correctly, because I'm not pulling data from any other model, the _prepareColumns call is all that's required. => yep. Displaying and sorting properly after the attr is saved.

@TITLE:insert event to calendar using intent
@CONTENT:I know this has been asked previously in this forum, but I tried everything written here and still nothing works for me. What I want to do is to insert an event to the calendar. Since there are several calendar applications on my device, I want to enable the user to choose which calendar application should contain the new event, similar to what happens when the user attempts to view a location using a map application (the user can select whether to activate google maps, the internet, ...). For this reason, I have to use an Intent. BTW, I'm aware that inserting new events to the calendar using Intents is allowed only on devices with SDK version 14 or higher. My device has an API level of 15, so it supports the calendar API. Here's my code: Intent calendarIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_INSERT);
calendarIntent.setData(Events.CONTENT_URI);
calendarIntent.putExtra(Events.TITLE, "title");
calendarIntent.putExtra(Events.EVENT_LOCATION, "address");
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
cal.set(Calendar.MONTH, 0);
cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2013);
cal.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 20);
cal.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0);
calendarIntent.putExtra(CalendarContract.EXTRA_EVENT_BEGIN_TIME, cal.getTime().getTime());
cal.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 20);
cal.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 30);
calendarIntent.putExtra(CalendarContract.EXTRA_EVENT_END_TIME, cal.getTime().getTime());

@TITLE:Laravel 4: save a polymorphic relationship's record: undefined method newQuery()
@CONTENT:I have a polymorphic relationship in Laravel 4 and it's working like I want. I have another one, which doesn't work when I try to insert the related model, even though it is identical to the first one and I use it in the same way. I have Event model and an Article model: // Article Model
class Article extends Eloquent {
    public function events() {
        return $this->morphMany('Event', 'eventable');
    }
    ...

// Event Model
class Event extends Eloquent {
    public function eventable() {
        return $this->morphTo();
    }
}
 Usage: $article = Article::find($article_id);
// insert
// neither of the following lines work
$article->events()->create(array("type" => "click"));
$article->events()->save(new Event(array("type" => "click")));
 I get the same error: Error: Call to undefined method Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event::newQuery() in

 What am I doing wrong? I have an identical situation with an Article and it's Photos, but there it works (it's also a polymorphic relation).

@TITLE:How to get Email from Task object record using SOQL
@CONTENT:I am trying to get the Contact/Lead email from the Task object using SOQL (I am creating an interface in PHP to back up messages with a specific subject). Here is my query right now: SELECT Subject,Who.FirstName,Who.LastName,Who.Email,Who.Phone,Description FROM Task
 This works/doesn't throw an error and gives me results, but Who.Email is always empty (and, coincidentally Who.Phone is as well, but it is not very important for this). If I try just using Email I get an error that the field doesn't exist, which is weird because Email is under Task Fields as a standard field. I have also tried several google searches with no sort of assistance found.

@TITLE:Using c#/ASP.NET to programmatically fake a login to a website
@CONTENT:So I'm in the process of attempting to simulate multiple logins all generating exceptions at the same time on our corporate website for the purpose of testing our logging framework (which we think there may be issues with thread synchronization). Anyway, so I need to log in to our website programatically. Here's what I have so far:         // Block 1
        Uri url = new Uri("http://withheld");
        HttpWebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(url) as HttpWebRequest;
        request.Method = "GET";
        HttpWebResponse response = request.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;
        string viewState = string.Empty;
        string previousPage = string.Empty;
        string eventValidation = string.Empty;
        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()))
        {
            string strResponse = reader.ReadToEnd();
            viewState = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(GetTagValue(strResponse, "__VIEWSTATE"));
            previousPage = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(GetTagValue(strResponse, "__PREVIOUSPAGE"));
            eventValidation = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(GetTagValue(strResponse, "__EVENTVALIDATION"));
        }


        // Block 2
        string username = "user01";
        string password = "password99";
        HttpWebRequest request2 = WebRequest.Create(url) as HttpWebRequest;
        request2.KeepAlive = true;
        request2.Method = "POST";
        request2.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
        string postData = string.Format("__LASTFOCUS=&ctrlCreateNewPassword_scriptManagerMaster_HiddenField=&__EVENTTARGET=&__EVENTARGUMENT=&__VIEWSTATE={0}&__PREVIOUSPAGE={1}&__EVENTVALIDATION={2}&UserName={3}&Password={4}&LoginButton=Log+in", new string[] { viewState, previousPage, eventValidation, username, password});
        byte[] dataBytes = UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData);
        request2.ContentLength = dataBytes.Length;
        using (Stream postStream = request2.GetRequestStream())
        {
            // Here's the problem
            postStream.Write(dataBytes, 0, dataBytes.Length);
        }
        HttpWebResponse httpResponse = request2.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;
        // At this point httpResponse.Cookies is null
        // I believe it's because the line above has actually initiated another
        // request/response which DOES NOT include the authentication cookie.
        // See fiddler output below to understand why I think that.


        // Block 3
        //Uri url2 = new Uri("http://Withheld/GenerateException.aspx");
        //http = WebRequest.Create(url2) as HttpWebRequest;
        //http.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
        //http.CookieContainer.Add(httpResponse.Cookies);
        //HttpWebResponse httpResponse2 = http.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;
 Looks reasonably straightforward right? Well it doesn't work. I don't know whether I need the viewState and whatnot or not, but I figured I'd mimic what a regular browser does as closely as possible. Near as I can tell what's happening is this: We hit the page with a simple GET. That gives us the viewstate, etc which is parsed out to be included in the following request. We now post the viewstate, username, password, etc to the server using postStream.Write(). The server at this point responds with an authentication cookie, and forwards us off to /Default.aspx. Now we execute reqest2.GetResponse(), but instead of getting the response that forwarded us to /default.aspx and had he authentication cookie, it looks like this line is actually causing ANOTHER request to get us the resource at /default.aspx. The problem is httpWebResponse DOES NOT include the authentication cookie we need for the next request (which is commented out currently). Why? Why is this behaving in this manor, and how do I handle it properly. Here's the output from fiddler to further explain what's going on: Block 1 generates this request/response Request Header: GET http://withheld/Login.aspx HTTP/1.1

 Note that the above response includes an authenication cookie. Now we run the following line of code with the intention of getting that cookie: HttpWebResponse httpResponse = request2.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;
 But instead the following request/response is generated in fiddler: Request: GET http://withtheld/Default.aspx?locale=en HTTP/1.1

 I believe this is the response that httpResponse now contains. How can I actually get the cookie to request up another protected page after the login is done? Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/14691452/filter-habtm-associated-model-with-conditions
@TITLE:filter HABTM-associated model with conditions
@CONTENT:preamble: a few days ago I asked a question to solve a HABTM-filter, I'm not able to do it even with tutorials, so "Obi Kwan Kenobi youre my only hope". What I want to achieve: Filtering Staff by GroupID which is used in StaffStaffgroup I'm having the following tablelayout staffs (a person can belong to many groups) staff_staffgroups (HABTM-linking table) staffgroups (has a groupname) The variable $tmp gets me a working array, but the problem is that Staff is a child object of StaffStaffgroups. I could parse throu and reassemble a array, but this isnt a nice solution. So I want to use the condition on Staff (see comented line) but then I get the error 1054 "column not found: 1054 Unknown column". I tried to bind and unbind, but no result there. $group_id = 2;
$tmp = $this->Staff->StaffStaffgroup->find('all',
        array('conditions' => array(
            'StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => $group_id,
            'Staff.isActive =' => "1",
            'Staff.last_name LIKE' => "%$name%",
            )
         )
);

debug($tmp);
 //$tmpConditions['AND'][] = array('StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => $group_ids);
 EDIT: I tried it with conditions and containable behaviour, but unfortunatelly its not filtering anything at all     $this->Staff->contain(array('StaffStaffgroup'));
    $this->paginate = array('StaffStaffgroup' =>array(
                                    array('conditions'  => array(
                                            'StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => '2'
                                        )
                                    )
                                )
    );
 I added to all models: public $actsAs = array('Containable'); I tried also with an inner join but no filtering there:  $this->paginate = array( 
 'conditions' => array('StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => 2 ),
 'joins' => array(
    array(
        'alias' => 'StaffStaffgroup',
        'table' => 'staff_staffgroups',
        'type' => 'INNER',
        'conditions' => 'StaffGroup_id = StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id'
    )
 )
 );
@CODE:$group_id = 2;
$tmp = $this->Staff->StaffStaffgroup->find('all',
        array('conditions' => array(
            'StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => $group_id,
            'Staff.isActive =' => "1",
            'Staff.last_name LIKE' => "%$name%",
            )
         )
);

debug($tmp); //$tmpConditions['AND'][] = array('StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => $group_ids); $this->Staff->contain(array('StaffStaffgroup'));
    $this->paginate = array('StaffStaffgroup' =>array(
                                    array('conditions'  => array(
                                            'StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => '2'
                                        )
                                    )
                                )
    ); $this->paginate = array( 
 'conditions' => array('StaffStaffgroup.staffgroup_id' => 2 ),

    array(
        'alias' => 'StaffStaffgroup',

@TITLE:Vim background with gnu screen
@CONTENT:I am having trouble with my colorscheme in vim. When editing a file using a vim session started in GNU screen, the text background is not rendered correctly. In a session outside screen, the entire background is gray (how it should be). For a vim window inside screen, only the background directly behind the text appears gray. The rest is black. I have TERM set to xterm-256color in both my .cshrc and .screenrc. My .vimrc has set t_Co=256 I am using csh. Edit: I am connecting through cygwin.

@TITLE:C# class without main method
@CONTENT:I'm learning C# and I'm very new to it, so forgive me for the seemingly stupid question. I have some experience in Java, and I noticed that C# programs also need a main() method in their main class. What if I want to create a class that isn't a main class, i.e. one that I import into a main class? I tried to do that, and when I compile (via cmd using csc File.cs) the compiler says that the .exe that it will make has no main() method. Does that mean that I was wrong, and every class needs a main() method, or that I'm compiling it wrongly? Maybe the problem's in the code (since I'm relying on my knowledge of Java syntax), which looks like this: public class Class {
    int stuff;
    public Class(int stuff) {
        this.stuff = stuff;
        stuff();
    }
    public void method() {
        stuff();
    }
}
 EDIT: I'm afraid this is terribly misunderstood. I'm not asking if the file needs a main method, I'm asking how I can import this class into another class, because I realise that if I am to do this I can't have a main (as I said, I have some Java experience), but whenever I try to compile without one the compiler tells me that I need one.
@CODE:main() csc File.cs main() main() public class Class {
    int stuff;
    public Class(int stuff) {
        this.stuff = stuff;
        stuff();
    }
    public void method() {
        stuff();
    }
} Class stuff(); Class class

@TITLE:How to make a socket a stream? To connect https response to S3 after imagemagick
@CONTENT:I am node and programming in general, and I have been really struggling with this... I want to take a https response, resize it with graphicsmagick and send it to my amazon S3 bucket. It appears that the https res is an IncomingMessage object (I can't find any info about that) and the stdout from graphicsmagick is a Socket. The weird thing is that I can use pipe and send both of these to a writeStream with a local path, and both res and stdout create a nice new resized image. And I can even send res to the S3 (using knox) and it works. But stdout doesn't want to go to the S3 :-/ Any help would be appreciated! https.get(JSON.parse(queryResponse).data.url,function(res){

    var headers = {
        'Content-Length': res.headers['content-length']
        , 'Content-Type': res.headers['content-type']
    }

    graphicsmagick(res)
      .resize('50','50')
      .stream(function (err, stdout, stderr) {

        req = S3Client.putStream(stdout,'new_resized.jpg', headers, function(err, res){
        })
        req.end()
    })

})

@TITLE:How to define/declare utf-8 code points for Turkish special chars (non-ascii) to use them as standart utf-8 encoding?
@CONTENT:T?rkish chars '????????????' are not handled correctly in utf-8 encoding altough they all seem to be defined. Charcodes of all of them is 65533 (replacemnt character, possibly for error display) in usage and a question mark or box is displayed depending on the selected font. In some cases 0/null is returned as charcode. On the internet, there are lots of tools which give utf-8 definitions of them but I am not sure if tools use any defined (real/international) registry or dynamicly create the definition with known rules and calculations. Fonts for them are well-defined and no problem to display them when we enter code points manually. This proves that they are defined in utf-8. But on the other hand they are not handled in encodings or tranaformations such as ajax requests/responses. So the base question is "HOW CAN WE DEFINE A CODEPOINT FOR A CHAR"? The question may be tailored as follows to prevent mis-conception. Suppose we have prepared the encoding data for "?" like this -> Character : ? Character name : LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA Hex code point : 00C7 Decimal code point : 199 Hex UTF-8 bytes : C387 ...... Where/How can we save this info to be a standard utf-8 char? How can we distribute/expose it (make ready to be used by others) ? Do we need any confirmation by anybody/foundation (like unicode/utf-8 consortium) How can we detect/fixup errors if they are already registered but not working correctly? Can we have custom-utf8 configuration? If yes how? Note : No code snippet is needed here as it is not mis-usage problem.

@TITLE:Embedded MongoDB Document not getting an ID on save with C# Driver
@CONTENT:When I have a root document that has a list of documents and I save/insert, the root document always gets an ID from MongoDB, but the documents in the list don't, they remain the same as ObjectId.Empty. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if this is intended behavior? Here's an example of what I'm trying to do: Given the classes: public class Foo
{
    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public IList<Bar> Bars { get; set; }
}

public class Bar
{
    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
 With a Factory: public class Factory
{
    public Foo CreateFoo(string name)
    {
        return new Foo {
            Id = new ObjectId(),
            Name = name,
            Bars = new List<Bar>()
        };
    }

    public Bar CreateBar(string name)
    {
        return new Bar {
            Id = new ObjectId(),
            Name = name
        };
    }
}
 When I run a sample like this: public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost");
        var server = client.GetServer();
        var database = server.GetDatabase("Example1");
        if (!database.CollectionExists("foos")) database.CreateCollection("foos");

        var factory = new Factory();
        var foo1 = factory.CreateFoo("first");
        foo1.Bars.Add(factory.CreateBar("bar"));
        var collection = database.GetCollection("foos");
        collection.Insert(foo1);

        var foo2 = factory.CreateFoo("second");
        collection.Insert(foo2);
        foo2.Bars.Add(factory.CreateBar("bar"));
        collection.Save(foo2);
    }
}
 Both foo1 and foo2 get _id's generated by MongoDB, but none of the Bars do. All the Bars still have the ObjectId.Empty. Now an easy solution is to update the factory to use ObjectId.GenerateNewId(), but I'd feel more comfortable with it being generated from the DB. Does anyone have any insight on this? Am I doing something wrong? Is this even possible? Thanks for the input.

 I run SCALA 2.9.2 with json4s 2.9.2:3.1.0 with the jackson parser 2.1.1 before i went to "json4s" i tryed jackson directly and got not even the the provided examples to work with extraction so i figure something is off here but not rly a clue where to start looking. Thanks in advance for help :)

 I want to find all the descendants (with all children up until leaf node) of a particular node. For example, here test's descendants are test1,test12,test123,test1234 & test12345 If I find descendants for test1, then result will be test12,test123,test1234. $(document).ready(function(){
$.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "test.xml",
    dataType: "xml",
    success: function(xml) {
        $(xml).find('child[value="test"]').children().each(function(){
            var i = $(this).attr('value');
            alert(i);

        });
    }
});
});
 The use of jQuery .children() gives me only that node's immediate child. It will not give its grandchildren. For example, for test it will alert only test1 & test12345.

@TITLE:Least intrusive compile barrier for Java on x86
@CONTENT:If I hava a Java process interacting with some other process via a shared ByteBuffer or similar, what would be the least intrusive equivalent of a compiler barrier in C/C++? No portability is required - I am specifically interested in x86. For example I have 2 processes reading and writing to an area of memory as per the pseudocode: p1:
    i = 0
    while true:
      A = 0
      //Write to B
      A = ++i

p2:
    a1 = A
    //Read from B
    a2 = A

    if a1 == a2 and a1 != 0:
      //Read was valid
 Due to the strict memory ordering on x86 (loads to separate locations not reorder and reads to separate locations not reordered) this does not require any memory barrier in C++, just a compile barrier between each write and between each read (i.e. asm volatile). How can I achieve the same ordering constraint in Java in the least expensive manner. Is there anything less intrusive than writing to a volatile?
@CODE:p1:
    i = 0
    while true:
      A = 0
      //Write to B
      A = ++i

p2:
    a1 = A
    //Read from B
    a2 = A

    if a1 == a2 and a1 != 0:

@TITLE:Why does one work and one crash?
@CONTENT:This has been driving me nuts for over a week. Below are two snippets of Lua code from a robot player in the game Bitfighter (written in C++, using a variant of LuaWrapper for binding). When I first start the Lua script, both work exactly as expected. But after some minutes of intense object creation and destruction, variant 2 stops working, and gives me the following error: robot.lua:253: attempt to call missing or unknown method 'getEnergy' (a nil value)
 To my eyes these should function identically. Who can explain the difference? Notes: target is a (heavy) userdata representing a C++ object. getEnergy and getHealth are properly registered C++ functions. I can reproduce this differing behavior easily. This is Lua 5.1, using the luavec mod. Variant 1 - always works local mt = getmetatable(target)
local pow = mt.getEnergy(target) + mt.getHealth(target)
 Variant 2 - starts failing after script has been running for an arbitrary amount of time  local pow = target:getEnergy() + target:getHealth()
@CODE:robot.lua:253: attempt to call missing or unknown method 'getEnergy' (a nil value) local mt = getmetatable(target)

@TITLE:How to declare interface that inherits from IClosable/IDisposable
@CONTENT:After being told in this question that my preferred solution was impossible, I'm now trying to implement a workaround. Instead of declaring my interface that inherits from IClosable in C++/CX, I'm declaring it in raw IDL. But that doesn't seem to work either. I've created an IDL file FooSpace.idl containing import "inspectable.idl";
import "Windows.Foundation.idl";
namespace FooSpace
{
    [uuid(01234567-89AB-CDEF-FEDC-BA9876543210)]
    [version(42)]
    interface Foo : IInspectable requires Windows.Foundation.IClosable
    {
    }
}
 and generate Windows Runtime metadata from it with midlrt /nomidl /metadata_dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\References\CommonConfiguration\Neutral" FooSpace.idl
 The generated FooSpace.winmd looks alright when I disassemble it with ildasm -- in particular, Foo appears to inherit from IClosable in just the same way IInputStream does in the system-provided Windows.winmd. However, when I try to use it from C++/CX -- not even implement it, just pretending for the time being that someone else has implemented it with WRL or whatever -- it doesn't seem to work. Here's my test C++/CX source file: void works(Windows::Storage::Streams::IInputStream^ istream) {
  Platform::IDisposable^ local = istream ;
}
void doesnt(FooSpace::Foo^ foo) {
  Platform::IDisposable^ local = foo ;
}
 which produces an error for Foo but not for IInputStream: C:\cygwin\tmp>cl /nologo /c /ZW /FU FooSpace.winmd  testit.cpp
testit.cpp
testit.cpp(5) : error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'FooSpace::Foo ^' to 'Platform::IDisposable ^'
        No user-defined-conversion operator available, or
        Types pointed to are unrelated; conversion requires reinterpret_cast, C-style cast or function-style cast
 What am I doing wrong here? On the other hand the equivalent C# code seems to compile fine: public class Whatever {
  public static void Works(Windows.Storage.Streams.IInputStream istream) {
    System.IDisposable local = istream ;
  }
  public static void AlsoWorks(FooSpace.Foo foo) {
    System.IDisposable local = foo ;
  }

@TITLE:Follow up: Boost serialized custom C++ object passed over ZeroMQ pull socket
@CONTENT:This is a follow up problem that I opened up earlier in another thread at Boost: De-serializing a custom C++ object passed over ZeroMQ pull socket. The problem in that thread has been resolved based on the answer provided. Now I have another problem at runtime. Please, see the below description. I am realtively new to C++ realm so I appreciate if you tell me any necessity for improvement in any part of the code provided in addition to what I descibed under problem statment. Description: I have a C++ class named GenericMessage which simply holds an id and data as its members (See code snippet 2 below - GenericMessage.hxx). My intention is to serialize an instance of this class and send it via a ZeroMQ socket which implements the push pattern. The serialization and sending task has been implemented in class ZMQHandler (see sendToBE function) which is placed in a header file name ZMQHandler.hxx shown in the code snippet 3 below. This class is instantiated by TestFE.cxx shown in the 4rd code snippet below. The receiving and de-serialization of the GenericMessage instance is implemented in TestBE.cxx available in the 5th code snippet below. My intention is to receive the GenericMessage instance over the ZMQ socket (i.e. pull socket), de-serialize it and then print its members to standard output. I verified that seriazalition and the GenericMessage object that is transferred over the ZeroMQ socket works fine. Deserialization seems to work as well cause I dont get any exception or segmentation fault like thing. Problem Statement: What is expected from the code in TestBE.cxx (see code snippet 5) is to receive the GenericMessage object over the ZeroMQ socket deserialize it and then print its two members namely id and data which is a string object in this case. More precisely it should first print the content of the char stream it gets and then the members of the de-serialized object. Instead, it does not print these members at all. Al, it puts weird symbols including question marks into the received char stream. Please see the 1st code snippet below, you'll see my point. QUESTIONs: i) Why cannot I get the expected output? Why do I see the question marked weird symbols in the output? Why I don't see the id and data fields printed although they are visible in the printed char stream? ii) The data field in the GenericMessage class is a template type which is set to std::string for testing purposes. However, in real use, I plan to transfer a much more complex object in a serialized form. In this respect, do you think the use of classes boost::archive::text_iarchive and boost::archive::text_oarchive is useful. Should I use binary instead? If so, is there some pitfalls/possible problems that you think I should be aware of? Thanks in advance. SNIPPET 1: Program output vs. expected output   *******************

@TITLE:EF Fault when retrieving data: wrong table name in SQL
@CONTENT:I have a simple edmx with 2 tables. The tables are related by a single Navigation Property. (1 to many). When I run my code I get an Exception: "Invalid Object Name dbo.Enquiries" There is no dbo.Enquiries in the database (it is actually called dbo.Enquiry), so the error itself is self explanatory. But where is it finding that Name, and how do I fix it? Edited to show code as requested.  var foo = (from  d in context.Dealerships

@TITLE:How to disable parent hover, when hovering over child
@CONTENT:I will try to show my problem on some simple example. What I have? http://jsfiddle.net/JGzSh/3/ Here is some simple button, which will have onlick events later. When i hover over green div (parent), :hover works changing its color a bit. What's the problem? The problem is, when I hover over yellow part, i want to change background of yellow element, but i don't want to parent :hover to work. Question So how can i disable parent :hover when hovering over child? (so parent's background will go back to starting color?) Those are only css rules about hovering so far .przycisk:hover{
    background-color: #383;
}
.skrot:hover{
    background-color: red;
}
 What have I tried so far? Thats most important question, I know. I did some research, and so far i found some solutions which could help me, but they all use jQuery, and my question is, if its possible to do it in CSS only, to keep it as simple as possible? Example of solution in jQuery found in google: $('.przycisk').hover(function(e){
    if($(e.target).is('.skrot')){
        // your child span is being hovered over
        e.stopPropagation();
    }else if($(e.target).is('.przycisk')){
        // your parent element is being hovered over
    }
});
@CODE::hover :hover :hover .przycisk:hover{

}
.skrot:hover{
    background-color: red;
} $('.przycisk').hover(function(e){
    if($(e.target).is('.skrot')){
        // your child span is being hovered over
        e.stopPropagation();

@LINK:/questions/14640184/does-the-java-foreach-loop-create-a-new-object
@TITLE:Does the Java foreach loop create a new object?
@CONTENT:Will Java create a new object each time a foreach loop is entered? I'm not talking about each iteration, but if you have a foreach loop that is used multiple times, is it creating objects each time? Simple Example: for(Object o : Objects)
{
    for(Object p : Objects2)
    {
    }
}
 Would there only be one p per execution, or would p be instantiated for each Object o? Does the Garbage Collector have to recover an object from the foreach loop each time it is exited? More specifically, I'm writing some Android based game code. It will iterate over all the game objects at a given rate per second, or as fast as it can depending on the circumstances. It may be a case of premature optimization, but if using an explicit for or while loop can guarantee me that I won't have excess garbage collection from my loops, then I can establish that as a coding standard for the project. More specifically: public void update()
{
    for(GameObject gObj : gameObjects)
    {
        gObj.update();
    }
}
 With update() being called from a thread designed to make the calls based on the timing I described before. Update: I am asking if there is a new Reference p being created for each o in Objects. Not if it copies the objects in Objects2. So does the VM have to create a new Reference p, and then does it collect that reference between iterations of the outter loop? And more specifically in my case, does it collect the reference between method calls? Update: From comments on Matt Ball's answer. Which would create less Garbage Collection work? //Loop just to have it run a number of times
//Could be running the inner foreach numerous time for any reason
for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{

@TITLE:Do I need a database reference for a linked server in a SQL Server database project?
@CONTENT:In my database project, I have added a reference to a linked server. When I use this linked server in a view and try to build my database project, SSDT reports errors because it cannot understand references to any of the schemas referenced on the linked server: [LinkedServer].[DB1].[dbo].[Table1]
 The above would returns an error that SSDT cannot decipher the reference to [DB1].[dbo].[Table1]. I tried to add a reference to this database, but SSDT required either a .dacpac file (produced by another database project) or a system database on the same server as the database in my project. How do I handle referencing an external database? There are use cases where a project needs to reference an remote database that is not an SSDT database project. In my case, I am accessing the database of another company and putting this database under version control as a SSDT project is out of the question.

Right now the only help I found online was for: Menu>Build>Configuration> Active Solution Platform defaulted to Any CPU, and I tried that but didn't work on 32-bit machine (unless I did something wrong) Tried Add a new one to the Debug configuration for platform x86 with build checked Compiled and ran the app on 32-bit machine getting error A.exe is not a valid Win32 application. My above was similar to what was done here: Link to Stack Overflow Similar Question UPDATE 1: The target OS is WinXP SP3 but we dont believe it has .NET 4.5 on it. I will be testing to see if compiling earlier ver of the app in .NET 4.0 will solve the problem and fix the problem. The problem may not be what the error message is displaying.

@TITLE:C# - Killing a process by a part of it's name
@CONTENT:I'm searching for how to do it in C#, like this : foreach (Process proc in Process.GetProcessesByName("cheatengine-x86_64"))
{
    proc.Kill();
}
 I am using this statement, but there are different versions of the program, like just cheatengine or cheatengine-x86, I'd like to close any of these, by starting with the name 'cheat', or just 'cheate', just to avoid the older versions.

@TITLE:jsonrpc4j: How to add type info to parameters?
@CONTENT:I am using jsonrpc4j and got stuck. I made a little example to show my problem: Abstract class: @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME)
@JsonSubTypes(value = { @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Walnut.class) })
public abstract class Nut {

}
 Concrete subclass: public class Walnut extends Nut {

}
 Interface for the service: public interface ServiceInterface {
    public Nut getNut();
    public void setNut(Nut nut);
}
 The service itself: public class Service implements ServiceInterface {
    public Nut getNut() { return new Walnut(); }
    public void setNut(Nut nut) {}
}
 Server: JsonRpcServer rpcServer = new JsonRpcServer(new ObjectMapper(), new Service());
StreamServer streamServer = new StreamServer(rpcServer, 50, 1420,
        50, InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1"));
streamServer.start();
 Client: JsonRpcClient jsonRpcClient = new JsonRpcClient(new ObjectMapper());
ServiceInterface remoteService = ProxyUtil.createClientProxy(
        ServiceInterface.class.getClassLoader(),
        ServiceInterface.class, jsonRpcClient,
        new Socket(InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1"), 1420));
 If i call remoteService.getNut() everything works as expected, the log prints: JSON-PRC Request: {"id":"6064348714687420633","jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getNut"}
JSON-PRC Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"6064348714687420633",
        "result":{"@type":"Walnut"}}
 If i call remoteService.setNut(new Walnut()) the server throws an exception, the log prints: JSON-PRC Request {"id":"9194853851254039397","jsonrpc":"2.0",
        "method":"setNut","params":[{}]}
Error in JSON-RPC Service com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException:
        Unexpected token (END_OBJECT), expected FIELD_NAME:
        missing property '@type' that is to contain type id  (for class Nut)
 The type information of the parameter is missing because the proxy wraps all parameters into one object array (see my last question to understand why the info type is missing in this case). How can i achieve the desired serialization? I tried to enable default typing and to annotate (with @JsonTypeInfo) the Object.class via mix-in, but both failed (exceptions below). With enabled default typing [remoteService.getNut(), error on server side]: Exception while handling request
        com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException:

 Any ideas?

@CONTENT:I would like to populate a combo box with a list of logical drives but I would like to exclude any mapped drives. The code below gives me a list of all logical drives without any filtering. comboBox.Items.AddRange(Environment.GetLogicalDrives());
 Is there a method available that can help you determine between physical drives and mapped drives?

 Ok, so this error makes sense to me, clearly it can't load a dynamic library. At first I thought I had to adjust my binding.gyp to include the linker settings, so I tried several different configurations. At the moment this is what it looks like: {

        {
            "target_name": "puzzle",

                ],
            }
        }
    ]

@TITLE:Elegant way to express shift left OR right in template
@CONTENT:I currently have a template function which, depending on its template parameters A and B, may shift a value either left or right: template <int A, int B> void f(X) {
// ...
if (A >= B)
{
  SetValue(X << (A-B));
}
else // (A < B)
{
  SetValue(X >> (B-A));
}
 When I instantiate the template for A<B, I get a warning for a negative shift right on the (unreachable) first branch, and else I get a warning for a negative shift left on the first branch. Our codebase is warning-free so this isn't acceptable. Is there a concise, readable alternative to these two shift statements? Similar questions (e.g. Dynamically shift left OR right) don't have this spurious warning as the shift distance is a runtime variable there.
@CODE:template <int A, int B> void f(X) {
// ...
if (A >= B)
{
  SetValue(X << (A-B));
}
else // (A < B)
{
  SetValue(X >> (B-A));
} A<B A B A B

 I have fixed my code so I no longer will exceed the limit, but still getting the error even after 4 days. I really don't need more than the normal quota so how do I get past this? Also what do they mean by Please sign up? Are they talking about requesting additional quota limits? Is there a way to query Freebase to keep track of your query count on a per second basis and a 24 hour cycle? I am passing in my API Key.

@TITLE:How to provide const interface with iterators to a collection?
@CONTENT:I would like to create a function with a signature like this: // Set found to be an iterator to the location of key in map or end()
// if not found.
bool lookup(const Key &key,
            const std::map<Key, Value> &map,
            std::map<Key, Value>::const_iterator &found);
 But I would like to also call it in cases where the map and iterator are not const so that I can modify the found value: const Key key;
std::map<Key, Value> map;
std::map<Key, Value>::iterator found;

if (lookup(key, map, found)) {
  found->second.modifingNonConstFunction()
}
 But I do not believe I can pass a std::map<Key, Value>::iterator object to a function expecting a reference to a std::map<Key, Value>::const_iterator since they are different types, whereas I normally could if the const was part of C++ declaration of the type like this and I could promote the non-const type to a const type: void someFunction(const int &arg);

int notConstArg = 0;
someFunction(nonConstArg);
 Other than by using templates to provide two definitions for lookup(), one as shown with const arguments 2 and 3 and another with non-const arguments 2 and 3, is there a better way in C++ to accomplish this more akin to how const int & can be passed a non-const int in the example above. In other words, can I just have a single function and not two?
@CODE:// Set found to be an iterator to the location of key in map or end()
// if not found.
bool lookup(const Key &key,
            const std::map<Key, Value> &map,
            std::map<Key, Value>::const_iterator &found); const Key key;
std::map<Key, Value> map;
std::map<Key, Value>::iterator found;

if (lookup(key, map, found)) {
  found->second.modifingNonConstFunction()
} std::map<Key, Value>::iterator std::map<Key, Value>::const_iterator const void someFunction(const int &arg);

int notConstArg = 0;
someFunction(nonConstArg); lookup() const const int & int int int

@TITLE:Convert from ArrayList<String[]> to Collection<Object[]>?
@CONTENT:I have a method that must return a Collection of Arrays. (It's a parameterized test in JUnit.) I actually only need to return three strings, but they need to be in a Collection of Arrays. This is my method: public static Collection<Object[]> browserList() {
    String[] firefox = { "firefox" };
    String[] chrome = { "chrome" };
    String[] ie = { "ie" };
    ArrayList<String[]> list = new ArrayList<String[]>(3);
    list.add(firefox);
    list.add(chrome);
    list.add(ie);
    return list;
}
 This gives an error: Type mismatch: cannot convert from ArrayList<String[]> to Collection<Object[]>. So really two questions: (a) what is wrong with this, considering that ArrayList is an implementation of Collection and String is derived from Object; and (b) how would I fix it? Thanks for any help.
@CODE:public static Collection<Object[]> browserList() {
    String[] firefox = { "firefox" };
    String[] chrome = { "chrome" };
    String[] ie = { "ie" };
    ArrayList<String[]> list = new ArrayList<String[]>(3);
    list.add(firefox);
    list.add(chrome);
    list.add(ie);
    return list;

@TITLE:Rails return JSON serialized attribute with_indifferent_access
@CONTENT:I previously had: serialize :params, JSON
 But this would return the JSON and convert hash key symbols to strings. I want to reference the hash using symbols, as is most common when working with hashes. I feed it symbols, Rails returns strings. To avoid this, I created my own getter/setter. The setter is simple enough (JSON encode), the getter is:   def params
    read_attribute(:params) || JSON.parse(read_attribute(:params).to_json).with_indifferent_access
  end
 I couldn't reference params directly because that would cause a loop, so I'm using read_attribute, and now my hash keys can be referenced with symbols or strings. However, this does not update the hash: model.params.merge!(test: 'test')
puts model.params # => returns default params without merge
 Which makes me think the hash is being referenced by copy. My question is twofold. Can I extend active record JSON serialization to return indifferent access hash (or not convert symbols to strings), and still have hash work as above with merge? If not, what can I do to improve my getter so that model.params.merge! works? I was hoping for something along the lines of (which works):   def params_merge!(hash)
    write_attribute(:params, read_attribute(:params).merge(hash))
  end

  # usage: model.params_merge!(test: 'test')
 Better yet, just get Rails to return a hash with indifferent access or not convert my symbols into strings! Appreciate any help.
@CODE:serialize :params, JSON def params
    read_attribute(:params) || JSON.parse(read_attribute(:params).to_json).with_indifferent_access
  end params read_attribute model.params.merge!(test: 'test')
puts model.params # => returns default params without merge model.params.merge! def params_merge!(hash)
    write_attribute(:params, read_attribute(:params).merge(hash))
  end

  # usage: model.params_merge!(test: 'test') model.params.merge!(test: 'test').save model.params = model.params.merge(test: 'test') params{} model.params[:test] = 'test' model.params = ... Hash.merge

 I am trying to count the number of vehicles that exists within one or more price ranges. BMW is only in 1 range, while Audi is in 3 ranges and Ford is in 3. The result I am after should look something like this: VehiclesPerRange:

 I have read through lots of posts on this forum and elsewhere about grouping by a range. But those examples are focused on 1 single price that should be grouped towards a range. I understand how to do this via a join etc., but I cant figure out how to write SQL to group a range towards a range. Any suggestions is highly appreciated!

@TITLE:Converting IEEE 754 Float to MIL-STD-1750A Float
@CONTENT:I am trying to convert a IEEE 754 32 bit single precision floating point value (standard c float variable) to an unsigned long variable in the format of MIL-STD-1750A. I have included the specification for both IEEE 754 and MIL-STD-1750A at the bottom of the post. Right now, I am having issues in my code with converting the exponent. I also see issues with converting the mantissa, but I haven't gotten to fixing those yet. I am using the examples listed in Table 3 in the link above to confirm if my program is converting properly. Some of those examples do not make sense to me. How can these two examples have the same exponent? .5 x 2^0 (0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000) 
-1 x 2^0 (1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000)
 .5 x 2^0 has one decimal place, and -1 has no decimal places, so the value for .5 x 2^0 should be .5 x 2^0 (0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010)
 right? (0010 instead of 0001, because 1750A uses plus 1 bias) How can the last example use all 32 bits and the first bit be 1, indicating a negative value? 0.7500001x2^4 (1001 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 0100)
 I can see that a value with a 127 exponent should be 7F (0111 1111) but what about a value with a negative 127 exponent? Would it be 81 (1000 0001)? If so, is it because that is the two's complement +1 of 127? Thank you

@TITLE:What is satellite information in data structures?
@CONTENT:Taken from Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen: "To keep things simple, we assume, as we have for binary search trees and red-black trees, that any satellite information associated with a key is stored in the same node as the key. In practice, one might actually store with each key just a pointer to another disk page containing the satellite information for that key. The pseudocode in this chapter implicitly assumes that the satellite information associated with a key, or the pointer to such satellite information, travels with the key whenever the key is moved from node to node." So I've been trying to Google the meaning of the term satellite information but I can't find any (covered by things about NASA). My understanding based on the text alone is that "satellite information" is an address to the location of the actual key value like a pointer? Am I correct or did I misunderstand it?

@TITLE:Scala: immutability and path-dependent type compatibility
@CONTENT:I have asked a few questions around this topic but this time I want to make it a more general discussion, since it seems to me that Scala is lacking some very important blocks. Consider the following code (which is simplified from my real project), trait World {
  type State <: StateIntf
  def evolve(s: State): State
  def initialState: State
}

class Algorithm(world: World) {
  def process(s: world.State) {
    val s1 = world.evolve(s)
    // ... do something with s and s1
  }
}
 Everything seems so beautiful and mathematical, but object SomeWorld extends World {...}
new Algorithm(SomeWorld).process(SomeWorld.initialState)  // incompatible type
 Certainly you can do in the following way trait World {
  type State <: StateIntf
  var s: State
  def evolve: Unit      // s = next state
  def initialize: Unit  // s = initial state
  def getState: StateIntf = s
}
 But we are just back to the mutable world. I am told that this is because Scala does not have flow analysis. If that is the problem, shouldn't Scala get that piece? I only need that compilor can be aware that values passed from val to val are the same so that their inner types must agree. This seems so natural to me, as: val is the most foundamental concept that involves immutability in scala Path dependent type compatability is needed to model things like World with complete immutability (which is highly desired from a mathematical perspective) Flow analysis of passing vals solve the problem Am I asking for too much? Or is there already a nice way of solving it?
@CODE:trait World {
  type State <: StateIntf
  def evolve(s: State): State
  def initialState: State
}

class Algorithm(world: World) {
  def process(s: world.State) {
    val s1 = world.evolve(s)

  }
} object SomeWorld extends World {...}

@TITLE:NVD3 - uneven ticks when updating data
@CONTENT:When I update the data in an existing NVD3 chart, the ticks along the x-axis are not rendering at fixed intervals. I'm creating a multiBarChart with data sourced from d3.json(). The data represents hits over a date range. I have a separate date range picker which updates the chart's data. I have the following to create the graph (simplified): initGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {
    nv.addGraph(function() {
      chart = nv.models.multiBarChart();

      d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
      nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);

      return chart;
    });
  });
};
 And the following function to update it, which is invoked in the date picker: redrawGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {

    d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
    nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);
  });
};
 Everything seems fine, however occasionally the tick spacing ends up inconsistent: This only occurs when updating an existing chart. I've spent quite some time verifying that the data is correct - that the x values are incrementing by fixed values - so I can only think that I'm missing something when redrawing the chart.
@CODE:multiBarChart d3.json() initGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {
    nv.addGraph(function() {
      chart = nv.models.multiBarChart();

      d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
      nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);

      return chart;
    });
  });
}; redrawGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {

    d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
    nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);
  });

}
 the NSLog setProgressiveDownloadProgressBlock works perfectly, i can see all the byte i download, but the progressBar don't update itself, remain always at zero...i can't understand how do it...and this is how i display the cell, and call the method to download: - (void)startDownload:(NSString *)downloadUrl
{
    //DocumentCell *cell = (DocumentCell *)[self.collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:self.downloadPath]; i have tried also in this way
     DocumentCell *cell = (DocumentCell *)[self.collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier forIndexPath:self.downloadPath];

[cell downloadDocumentWithUrl:requestUrl];
}

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.

    UINib *cellNib = [UINib nibWithNibName:@"DocumentCell" bundle:nil];

@TITLE:JSON to JQuery: What am I doing wrong?
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to javascript and jquery development. I have a table of values I'm fetching in PHP and formatting as a JSON string, because JSON looks like a great way to get data into javascript. But I'm having trouble addressing the javascript variable. The JSON data is in a very simple format. It looks like this: [
    {"id":"1","name":"Bob","haircolor":"brown"},
    {"id":"2","name":"Carol","haircolor":"Red"}
]
 And so on. None of the entries are complex. It's just flat rows of data. I'm using $.getJSON() from JQuery to place the data in a variable like so: var people;
$.getJSON("php/getpeople.php", function(data){ //getpeople.php generates the JSON
    people.push(data);
});
 According to console.log(data), the object 'data' is getting populated with the contents of my JSON string. But the push is generating these errors in the javascript console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of undefined
 What am I missing? And is there any other information you need to help me on this? I've ground to a halt on this project because of this problem, and I'm just too much of a javascript newbie to figure it out.
@CODE:[
    {"id":"1","name":"Bob","haircolor":"brown"},

@TITLE:logical inconsistence between Set and SortedSet interfaces in Java [closed]
@CONTENT:I noticed a logical inconsistence between Set and SortedSet interfaces in Java. SortedSet recognizes different objects (by equal() method) as equals if they are the same during the comparison, but it is logically incorrect. Comparing of objects should be responsible only for order of objects. For example: I can have many products and I want to sort them by price. In this case the SortedSet cant contain different products with the same price: [salt,0.5$], [milk, 1$], [bread, 1$], [bananas, 2$] In example above milk will be replaced by bread. In this case the contract of inherited Set interface will be violated, because unequals objects replace each other. I red JavaDoc of SortedSet and know that this behavior well documented, but I think it is a logical failure. What is your opinion, maybe you have already similar problems with Set and SortedSet?

@TITLE:Detect 'server offline' with SignalR
@CONTENT:We are attempting to use SignalR in an low-bandwidth environment where the connection to the backend server can come and go randomly, and we want our web application to respond appropriately. It looks like this connection API has been in flux over the past year, but in accordance with the latest documentation, I have tried hooking up to $.connection.hub.stateChanged to detect changes in the connection status, and I get a couple hits on startup when the client goes from disconnected -> connecting -> connected, but when I stop the server, the event handler does not fire, and when I start the server again, the real-time messaging is no longer working. To test this scenario, I am on Windows 7 running the ASP.NET web server in IIS and the web client is running in Google Chrome. Once the site is running, and messages are being exchanged, I kill the website in IIS, and the messages stop but the client does not receive any notification. Here's a quick snippet (using TypeScript): $.connection.hub.stateChanged((change) => {
   console.log("state changed...");
   console.log(change);

   if (change.newState === $.signalR.connectionState.reconnecting) {

@TITLE:Subclassing method with ellipsis array argument?
@CONTENT:I would like to subclass an object that has the ellipsis syntax in the init header. i.e. -(void) initObjectWith:(NSString*)argument arguments:(NSString*)someArgument,...;
 I'm unsure how to pass along the arguments array in this case. I suspect it would be something like: - (void) initObjectWithCustomInitializer:(NSString*)argument additionalArgument:(NSString*)additionalArgument argument:(NSString*) someArgument,... {
  self = [super initObjectWith:argument arguments:someArgument,...];
  if (self) {
     //custom init code here
  }
  return self
}
 This compiles but the nil-terminated 'arguments' array is only getting the first argument. How do I pass along the objects of a nil-terminated array?
@CODE:-(void) initObjectWith:(NSString*)argument arguments:(NSString*)someArgument,...; - (void) initObjectWithCustomInitializer:(NSString*)argument additionalArgument:(NSString*)additionalArgument argument:(NSString*) someArgument,... {
  self = [super initObjectWith:argument arguments:someArgument,...];

@TITLE:Log4j2 auto config
@CONTENT:I have a problem applying the log4j2.xml auto configuration properly, and I think it has something to do with my folder arrangement. I'm using maven to add log4j2 libs and arrange my projects as follows: - one project to contain all "common" classes, used by server and client side of my system. - another "core" project - the server side application. Both projects use the same general package hierarchy (like com.foo.specific.package) In the Common project I define a logger wrapper: public class LogWrapper
{
    static Logger systemParentLogger = LogManager.getLogger("com.foo");

    public static Logger getLogger(Class<?> cls)
    {
        return LogManager.getLogger(cls.getName());
    }
}
 Moreover, the Common project contains the log4j2.xml file under META-INF (alongside the persistence.xml file for Hibernate usage). <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <appenders>

        </logger>
    </loggers>

</configuration>
 While running a sample code in the Core project (using the LogWrapper I wrote and some JPA voodoo), I could still see INFO hibernate logs, and no log file was created. I should state that while debugging the code, I could see that the logger fetched was given some weird value "com.foo.core.persistence.PersistenceXMLTest:ERROR in sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@2f600492"
@CODE:public class LogWrapper

    static Logger systemParentLogger = LogManager.getLogger("com.foo");

This is how it looks like: This is how I initialize the UIActionSheet:     UIActionSheet *styleAlert = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:AMLocalizedString(@"SELECT_PICTURE_TITLE", @"?berschrift des Actionsheets")
                                                            delegate:self
                                                   cancelButtonTitle:AMLocalizedString(@"CANCEL_BUTTON_TITLE", @"Abbrechen butten")
                                              destructiveButtonTitle:nil
                                                   otherButtonTitles:AMLocalizedString(@"TAKE_PICTURE_BUTTON_TITLE", @"Bild aufnehmen button"),
                                 AMLocalizedString(@"CAMERA_ROLL_BUTTON_TITLE", @"Aus Bibliothek ausw?hlen"), nil];

    // use the same style as the nav bar
    [styleAlert showInView:self.parentViewController.tabBarController.view];
    //[styleAlert showInView:[self.navigationController view] ];
    [styleAlert release];
 and - (void)willPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet {
    actionSheet.layer.backgroundColor = GLOBAL_TINT_COLOR.CGColor;
}
 I could not figure out how to set the border with the same color. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

 I have confirmed that Audience Manager is installed and working on the server. By running the programme from a shell logged in as the MTS User, we can avoid this problem. At first we thought the issue was with file system permissions on the log folder, however, even granting full control does not help. When comparing procmon output from running the code as the two users, we could see that the user for whom it failed was getting ACCESS DENIED for creating a file within C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys - the filename is a long string of random-looking characters. This ACCESS DENIED is not seen for MtsUser.

 Is one preferable over the other? Are there performance differences, or would one method not work but the other would in particular situations?

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to detect when a checkbox checked value has been changed. addEventListener() or jQuery on() mostly work, but neither will detect a change made this way: <input type="checkbox" id="testCheckbox">

<script type="text/javascript">
   document.getElementById("testCheckbox").checked = true;

 Is there a way I can detect this change ? Even something that only works in the latest browsers would be great. Edit: To be clear, I want to detect changes made by any script on the page. I don't necessarily control them, so I can't trigger an event myself.

    // ... do something with s and s1
  }
}
 Everything seems so beautiful and mathematical, but object SomeWorld extends World {...}
new Algorithm(SomeWorld).process(SomeWorld.initialState)  // incompatible type
 Certainly you can do in the following way trait World {
  type State <: StateIntf
  var s: State
  def evolve: Unit      // s = next state
  def initialize: Unit  // s = initial state
  def getState: StateIntf = s
}
 But we are just back to the mutable world. I am told that this is because Scala does not have flow analysis. If that is the problem, shouldn't Scala get that piece? I only need that compilor can be aware that values passed from val to val are the same so that their inner types must agree. This seems so natural to me, as: val is the most foundamental concept that involves immutability in scala Path dependent type compatability is needed to model things like World with complete immutability (which is highly desired from a mathematical perspective) Flow analysis of passing vals solve the problem Am I asking for too much? Or is there already a nice way of solving it?
@CODE:trait World {
  type State <: StateIntf
  def evolve(s: State): State
  def initialState: State
}

class Algorithm(world: World) {
  def process(s: world.State) {
    val s1 = world.evolve(s)
    // ... do something with s and s1
  }
} object SomeWorld extends World {...}
new Algorithm(SomeWorld).process(SomeWorld.initialState)  // incompatible type trait World {
  type State <: StateIntf
  var s: State
  def evolve: Unit      // s = next state
  def initialize: Unit  // s = initial state
  def getState: StateIntf = s
} val val val World val

@TITLE:NVD3 - uneven ticks when updating data
@CONTENT:When I update the data in an existing NVD3 chart, the ticks along the x-axis are not rendering at fixed intervals. I'm creating a multiBarChart with data sourced from d3.json(). The data represents hits over a date range. I have a separate date range picker which updates the chart's data. I have the following to create the graph (simplified): initGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {
    nv.addGraph(function() {
      chart = nv.models.multiBarChart();

      d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
      nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);

      return chart;
    });
  });
};
 And the following function to update it, which is invoked in the date picker: redrawGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {

    d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
    nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);
  });
};
 Everything seems fine, however occasionally the tick spacing ends up inconsistent: This only occurs when updating an existing chart. I've spent quite some time verifying that the data is correct - that the x values are incrementing by fixed values - so I can only think that I'm missing something when redrawing the chart.
@CODE:multiBarChart d3.json() initGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {
    nv.addGraph(function() {
      chart = nv.models.multiBarChart();

      d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
      nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);

      return chart;
    });
  });
}; redrawGraph = function(url) {
  d3.json(url, function(data) {

    d3.select('#chart svg').datum(data).transition().duration(500).call(chart);
    nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);

 the NSLog setProgressiveDownloadProgressBlock works perfectly, i can see all the byte i download, but the progressBar don't update itself, remain always at zero...i can't understand how do it...and this is how i display the cell, and call the method to download: - (void)startDownload:(NSString *)downloadUrl
{
    //DocumentCell *cell = (DocumentCell *)[self.collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:self.downloadPath]; i have tried also in this way
     DocumentCell *cell = (DocumentCell *)[self.collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier forIndexPath:self.downloadPath];

[cell downloadDocumentWithUrl:requestUrl];
}

@TITLE:JSON to JQuery: What am I doing wrong?
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to javascript and jquery development. I have a table of values I'm fetching in PHP and formatting as a JSON string, because JSON looks like a great way to get data into javascript. But I'm having trouble addressing the javascript variable. The JSON data is in a very simple format. It looks like this: [
    {"id":"1","name":"Bob","haircolor":"brown"},
    {"id":"2","name":"Carol","haircolor":"Red"}
]
 And so on. None of the entries are complex. It's just flat rows of data. I'm using $.getJSON() from JQuery to place the data in a variable like so: var people;
$.getJSON("php/getpeople.php", function(data){ //getpeople.php generates the JSON
    people.push(data);
});
 According to console.log(data), the object 'data' is getting populated with the contents of my JSON string. But the push is generating these errors in the javascript console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of undefined
 What am I missing? And is there any other information you need to help me on this? I've ground to a halt on this project because of this problem, and I'm just too much of a javascript newbie to figure it out.

@TITLE:logical inconsistence between Set and SortedSet interfaces in Java [closed]
@CONTENT:I noticed a logical inconsistence between Set and SortedSet interfaces in Java. SortedSet recognizes different objects (by equal() method) as equals if they are the same during the comparison, but it is logically incorrect. Comparing of objects should be responsible only for order of objects. For example: I can have many products and I want to sort them by price. In this case the SortedSet cant contain different products with the same price: [salt,0.5$], [milk, 1$], [bread, 1$], [bananas, 2$] In example above milk will be replaced by bread. In this case the contract of inherited Set interface will be violated, because unequals objects replace each other. I red JavaDoc of SortedSet and know that this behavior well documented, but I think it is a logical failure. What is your opinion, maybe you have already similar problems with Set and SortedSet?

@CONTENT:I am using the linux-headers-2.6.32-21 package on Virtual Machine. I am going to write a new system call. I have found the other files to write initials of system calls but I am unable to find this syscall_table_32.S in arch/x86/kernel/ directory. Please help me how and where I can find this file. I am doubted that it might be hidden due to permission issues or others.

@TITLE:Detect 'server offline' with SignalR
@CONTENT:We are attempting to use SignalR in an low-bandwidth environment where the connection to the backend server can come and go randomly, and we want our web application to respond appropriately. It looks like this connection API has been in flux over the past year, but in accordance with the latest documentation, I have tried hooking up to $.connection.hub.stateChanged to detect changes in the connection status, and I get a couple hits on startup when the client goes from disconnected -> connecting -> connected, but when I stop the server, the event handler does not fire, and when I start the server again, the real-time messaging is no longer working. To test this scenario, I am on Windows 7 running the ASP.NET web server in IIS and the web client is running in Google Chrome. Once the site is running, and messages are being exchanged, I kill the website in IIS, and the messages stop but the client does not receive any notification. Here's a quick snippet (using TypeScript): $.connection.hub.stateChanged((change) => {
   console.log("state changed...");
   console.log(change);

   if (change.newState === $.signalR.connectionState.reconnecting) {
      this.raise('action:disconnected');
   }
   else if (change.newState === $.signalR.connectionState.connected) {
      this.raise('action:connected');
   }
});
 Any guidance would be much appreciated, thanks! -Jeremy

@TITLE:Subclassing method with ellipsis array argument?
@CONTENT:I would like to subclass an object that has the ellipsis syntax in the init header. i.e. -(void) initObjectWith:(NSString*)argument arguments:(NSString*)someArgument,...;
 I'm unsure how to pass along the arguments array in this case. I suspect it would be something like: - (void) initObjectWithCustomInitializer:(NSString*)argument additionalArgument:(NSString*)additionalArgument argument:(NSString*) someArgument,... {
  self = [super initObjectWith:argument arguments:someArgument,...];
  if (self) {
     //custom init code here
  }
  return self
}
 This compiles but the nil-terminated 'arguments' array is only getting the first argument. How do I pass along the objects of a nil-terminated array?
@CODE:-(void) initObjectWith:(NSString*)argument arguments:(NSString*)someArgument,...; - (void) initObjectWithCustomInitializer:(NSString*)argument additionalArgument:(NSString*)additionalArgument argument:(NSString*) someArgument,... {

@TITLE:Log4j2 auto config
@CONTENT:I have a problem applying the log4j2.xml auto configuration properly, and I think it has something to do with my folder arrangement. I'm using maven to add log4j2 libs and arrange my projects as follows: - one project to contain all "common" classes, used by server and client side of my system. - another "core" project - the server side application. Both projects use the same general package hierarchy (like com.foo.specific.package) In the Common project I define a logger wrapper: public class LogWrapper
{
    static Logger systemParentLogger = LogManager.getLogger("com.foo");

    public static Logger getLogger(Class<?> cls)
    {
        return LogManager.getLogger(cls.getName());
    }
}
 Moreover, the Common project contains the log4j2.xml file under META-INF (alongside the persistence.xml file for Hibernate usage). <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    </loggers>

</configuration>
 While running a sample code in the Core project (using the LogWrapper I wrote and some JPA voodoo), I could still see INFO hibernate logs, and no log file was created. I should state that while debugging the code, I could see that the logger fetched was given some weird value "com.foo.core.persistence.PersistenceXMLTest:ERROR in sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@2f600492"
@CODE:public class LogWrapper

    static Logger systemParentLogger = LogManager.getLogger("com.foo");

@TITLE:UIActionSheet backGroundColor on iPad
@CONTENT:I'm struggeling with an issuse for quite a while now. Since I don't really find a solution, I hope somebody here will be able to help me. I have a UIActionSheet that I want to have a different background color. With [[myAlert layer] setBackgroundColor:[UIColor redColor].CGColor]; I am able to change most of the alert's color. This is how it looks like: This is how I initialize the UIActionSheet:     UIActionSheet *styleAlert = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:AMLocalizedString(@"SELECT_PICTURE_TITLE", @"?berschrift des Actionsheets")
                                                            delegate:self

    [styleAlert release];
 and - (void)willPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet {
    actionSheet.layer.backgroundColor = GLOBAL_TINT_COLOR.CGColor;
}
 I could not figure out how to set the border with the same color. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

 I have confirmed that Audience Manager is installed and working on the server. By running the programme from a shell logged in as the MTS User, we can avoid this problem. At first we thought the issue was with file system permissions on the log folder, however, even granting full control does not help. When comparing procmon output from running the code as the two users, we could see that the user for whom it failed was getting ACCESS DENIED for creating a file within C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys - the filename is a long string of random-looking characters. This ACCESS DENIED is not seen for MtsUser.

 Is one preferable over the other? Are there performance differences, or would one method not work but the other would in particular situations?

@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to detect when a checkbox checked value has been changed. addEventListener() or jQuery on() mostly work, but neither will detect a change made this way: <input type="checkbox" id="testCheckbox">

<script type="text/javascript">
   document.getElementById("testCheckbox").checked = true;

 Is there a way I can detect this change ? Even something that only works in the latest browsers would be great. Edit: To be clear, I want to detect changes made by any script on the page. I don't necessarily control them, so I can't trigger an event myself.

@TITLE:Should Git be used to store continuous integration builds?
@CONTENT:In an environment where multiple builds (release candidate packages) can be created daily but only one a month gets promoted to production, I think storing every build in Git would be wasteful but there should be a short term location that the last few builds are published. I'm currently publishing these to a shared directory. I have see IVY used for this sort of binary publishing in the past. Git seems like overkill as it would bloat due to it's model of never delete anything. Is there an agreed, standardized way of managing/publishing these transient build artifacts?

@LINK:/questions/14486930/typescript-event-handler-function-for-event-type-field-incorrect-context
@TITLE:Typescript event handler function for event type field - Incorrect context
@CONTENT:This is a jquery interface from jquery.d.ts: export interface IDialogEvent extends DialogEvent {
    (event: Event, ui: DialogUIParams): void;
}
 This is my custom interface mimicking partial functionality of the DialogOptions interface of jquery.d.ts: export interface IDialogOptions {
    open: IDialogEvent;
}

export class DialogClass implements IDialogOptions { 

    //Dialog options
    public open: IDialogEvent;

    //Class related fields
    public someField: any;
    public dialogEl: JQuery;

    constructor() { 
        this.open = this.OpenHandler;
        this.dialogEl = $("<div></div>").dialog(this); 
        //Passing "this" initializes the dialog by mapping relevant class fields
        //to the dialog's "option" object, in this case the only "relevant" field is "open".
    }

    public OpenHandler(event: Event, ui: DialogUIParams) { 
        var value = this.someField; //BAD. "this" is not type BaseClass
    }

    public NonEventHandlerMethod() { 
        var value = this.someField; //GOOD. "this" is type BaseClass
    }  
}

var dialog = new DialogClass();
dialog.dialogEl.dialog("open"); 
 The last line fires OpenHandler() but inside it, this is not type BaseDialog (unlike in NonEventHandlerMethod). The reason I need an event handler function for the dialog options field and the reason why I can't simply do this:  export class DialogClass implements IDialogOptions { 
     ...
      constructor() { 
          this.open = () => {
                //event handling logic
          };
          ...
      }
      ...
 }        
 is because I need to add additional open-event handling logic in classes that extend DialogClass and there is no differentiation between this.member and super.member... there is only differentiation between this.function() and super.function():  export class LoginDialog extends DialogClass { 
     ...
      constructor() { 
          this.open = this.OpenHandler;
          ...
      }

      public OpenHandler(event: Event, ui: DialogUIParams) { 
           super.OpenHandler(); //Base handling logic

           //Additional handling logic
      } 
      ...
 } 
 I think this may be a bug because    export class DialogClass implements IDialogOptions { 
     ...
      constructor() { 
          this.open = () => {
                var test = this.someField;  //Correct context
          };
          ...
      }
      ...
   }  
 and calling the method directly:    var dialog = new DialogClass();
   dialog.OpenHandler();  //Correct context when called directly
   //Note: I haven't actually tested this persay but this function is no different
   //than any other functionso a direct call should certainly not be problem.

    (event: Event, ui: DialogUIParams): void;

The problem is that if the page reload is cancelled by the user, the table stays greyed out. I would like to notice if the page submit was cancelled, and if so, fade the table back in and remove the overlay. My question is: Is there an event I can bind to using either straight Javascript or jQuery for when loading of a new page is cancelled?

pilot_object.study_name = self.data['study_name']
pilot_object.file_list = files_list #file paths (strings)
 where self.data is the data received from the form. Now I want to serialize to JSON this object (pilot_object) as described in the documentation: data_serialized = serializers.serialize('json', [pilot_object, ])

 Now the important thing I need here... FOR EACH category, I want to show the latest post and topic title in each category. However, this select statement is going INSIDE a foreach loop looping around the general categories which is found my main_cat. So there are 5 main categories with 3-8 subcategories.. this is the subcategory query. BUT FOR EACH subcategory, I need to grab the latest post.. However, it only runs this SELECT query for each main category so it's only select THE LATEST post between all subcategories combined... I want to get the latest post of EACH subcategory, but I rather not run this query for each subcategory... since I want the page load to be fast. BUT REMEMBER, some subcategories WILL NOT have a latest post since some of them may not even contain a topic yet! So hence the left join. Does anyone know how to go about doing this? AND BTW, there is an error it gives me (WHERE ft.cat_id = c.id) in the subquery because c.id is an unknown column. But I'm trying to reference it from the outer query so can someone help me on that issue as well? Thank you! All tables: forum_cat (Subcategories)

@TITLE:ASP.NET WebForms Checking all Checkboxes in a GridView using jQuery v1.9.0 doesn't work
@CONTENT:I've a problem with my application regarding jQuery. I tried a code example ( http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/120810-1.aspx ) to use a Header CheckBox to check/uncheck all rows inside a GridView. The sample code works with jQuery v1.4.4 but doesn't work with the latest jQuery release v1.9.0. Here's the code. <script type="text/javascript">
    var allCheckBoxSelector = '#<%=gvFileList.ClientID%> input[id*="chkAll"]:checkbox';
    var checkBoxSelector = '#<%=gvFileList.ClientID%> input[id*="chkSelected"]:checkbox';

    function ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded() {
        var totalCheckboxes = $(checkBoxSelector),
            checkedCheckboxes = totalCheckboxes.filter(":checked"),
            noCheckboxesAreChecked = (checkedCheckboxes.length === 0),
            allCheckboxesAreChecked = (totalCheckboxes.length === checkedCheckboxes.length);

        $(allCheckBoxSelector).attr('checked', allCheckboxesAreChecked);
    }

    $(document).ready(function () {
        $(allCheckBoxSelector).live('click', function () {
            $(checkBoxSelector).attr('checked', $(this).is(':checked'));

            ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded();
        });

        $(checkBoxSelector).live('click', ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded);

        ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded();
    });
</script>
 With jQuery v1.4.4 everything works perfect. Using jQuery v1.9.0 every page load I get a "Object doesn't support this property or method: .live" error. If I use the syntax: $(allCheckBoxSelector).click(function () {...
 instead of the one above, I avoid the error but the Header Checkbox works only once. If I click it again nothing appens. I also tried the .on syntax: $(allCheckBoxSelector).on('click', function () {...
 but it doesn't work too. I'd like to know if that issue is due to a change or a bug in jQuery v1.9.0.
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript">
    var allCheckBoxSelector = '#<%=gvFileList.ClientID%> input[id*="chkAll"]:checkbox';
    var checkBoxSelector = '#<%=gvFileList.ClientID%> input[id*="chkSelected"]:checkbox';

    function ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded() {
        var totalCheckboxes = $(checkBoxSelector),
            checkedCheckboxes = totalCheckboxes.filter(":checked"),
            noCheckboxesAreChecked = (checkedCheckboxes.length === 0),
            allCheckboxesAreChecked = (totalCheckboxes.length === checkedCheckboxes.length);

        $(allCheckBoxSelector).attr('checked', allCheckboxesAreChecked);
    }

    $(document).ready(function () {
        $(allCheckBoxSelector).live('click', function () {
            $(checkBoxSelector).attr('checked', $(this).is(':checked'));

            ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded();
        });

        $(checkBoxSelector).live('click', ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded);

        ToggleCheckUncheckAllOptionAsNeeded();
    });

 I'm aware of the limitation of floating point representation. Just curious why the more clumsy expression seems to give "better" result.

@TITLE:Singleton pattern for IndexWriter and IndexSearcher Lucene.net
@CONTENT:I'm using Lucene.net 3.0.3.0(the latest version right now). I would like to know if using a single instance of IndexWriter and IndexSearcher is a good choice in production environment(considering thread safety).

@TITLE:Bash base 62 to decimal conversion
@CONTENT:I would like to reverse the operation performed by the following bash command: $ echo $((62#a39qrT))
9207903953
 i.e. convert decimal to base 62, keeping bash standard of {0..9},{a..z},{A..Z}. I know I can do this by using bc, but I will have to manually convert each character then. For example, I do this currently: BASE62=($(echo {0..9} {a..z} {A..Z}))
for i in $(echo "obase=62; 9207903953" | bc)
do
    echo -n ${BASE62[$i]} #Doesn't work if bc's output contains leading zeroes
done
 There must be a way to do this in a less 'hackier' way. Do you know of a way to do this more efficiently? EDIT: changed bc input
@CODE:$ echo $((62#a39qrT))
9207903953 {0..9},{a..z},{A..Z} BASE62=($(echo {0..9} {a..z} {A..Z}))

@LINK:/questions/14470448/postgresql-password-authentication-fail-after-adding-group-roles
@TITLE:PostgreSQL - Password authentication fail after adding group roles
@CONTENT:I'm pretty new to PostreSQL. I've spent all morning trying to get user logins working properly, and I'm terribly frustrated by now! So, I have a PostGIS database, version 9.2, as part of the OpenGeo suite of software. I could access the database with the postgres user, but want to make a group role and user with access to a database so that it can create tables and update/select/delete etc. in that database. I can create a user, that works, and I can login with that user. I can create a group role and assign privileges to the role. I can then add the user to the group role, and then can NO LONGER LOGIN! It even got so that when I added the user postgres to the group, that user can't login. I remove the group but the inability to login persists. Now, I have played with pg_hba.conf a lot. And I can now login as postgres, but only if 'trust' is enabled, and I can't login with any software, such as PGAdminIII. It would be great to get some advice as to what is going wrong, and to enable authenticated logins again. pg_hba: Code:
# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
local   all             postgres                                trust
local all gisadmin trust

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all         opengeo                           md5
local   all         opengeo                           md5

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5

host all gisadmin localhost trust


# IPv6 local connections:

# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication     postgres                                peer

#host    replication     postgres        ::1/128                 md5
 Just as a final note, I would like to be able to login via a SSH tunnel. I could do that originally with the 'postgres' user, but now that I added and removed that user from a group, I can't. Edit: the error messages... If I login via SSH tunnel in PGAdmin with the correct password, I get the error "FATAL: password authentication failed for the user ..." If I try to login via SSH tunnel in PGAdmin without a password, while the trust option is set, I get the error: "error connecting to the server: fe_sendauth: no password supplied". The first error still happens when logging in locally, just via SSH and psql, but the second one goes away and I can log in. output of \du+: output of \dg+

@LINK:/questions/14468478/hard-coded-id-column-in-laravel-query-php
@TITLE:Hard coded id column in Laravel query.php
@CONTENT:I've ran into a problem with some queries in Laravel due to the fact that some methods in query.php have a hard coded id as a column. Hence, if you use some other name than id in your database, these functions will fail miserably. In my case I have an existing MSSQL database were the identity column of the user table is UserId not id. In my case the problem arises after a user has logged in - the script barfs with: SELECT TOP 1 [userid] FROM [User] WHERE [id] = ?
 Fluent seems to call one of those problematics functions, find in query.php, when trying to retrieve user data. Has anyone addressed this problem and if so how did you deal with? UPDATE: I do use Fluent as Auth driver and the error is triggered when doing Auth::check() or Auth::guest().

@TITLE:Get *coarse* location from GPS provider on Android
@CONTENT:My app only needs very rough location data, so I originally set my manifest permissions to ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, and set up a location listener for NETWORK_PROVIDER. This gave me exactly the kind of rough location estimate I needed, but only with Google Location Services turned on. I was expecting that if the user only had GPS enabled, that I would still receive a rough estimate of their location. But it seems like the only way to get ANY location information from the GPS_PROVIDER is by using the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission. So, is it true that with only GPS enabled, an app cannot receive location information unless it has the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission? In other words, the GPS_PROVIDER can't send rough location estimates if the app only has ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission?

@TITLE:Is the root node an internal node?
@CONTENT:So I've looked around the web and a couple of questions here in stackoverflow here are the definition: Generally, an internal node is any node that is not a leaf (a node with no children) Non-leaf/Non-terminal/Internal node V has at least one child or descendant node with degree not equal to 0 As far as i understand it, it is a node which is not a leaf. I was about to conclude that the root is also an internal node but there seems to be some ambiguity on its definition as seen here: What is an "internal node" in a binary search tree? As the wonderful picture shows, internal nodes are nodes located between the root of the tree and the leaves If we follow that definition then the root node isn't going to be counted as an internal node. So is a root node an internal node or not?

FieldTest app is a hidden app on ios devices, and can be started by typing a series of keys on the iPhone phone app keypad. I would like to run FieldTest on iPad, but iPad doesn't have a phone app/keypad. In older versions of IOS one is able to run it by doing the 5-finger swipe while in Safari, but it no longer works.

@TITLE:Knowing where memory is being allocated using FastMM
@CONTENT:I am trying to debug memory usage in a large application using Delphi 7. I was able to installed fastmm debug full dll and with it solve some leak problems. I also installed the memory usage tracker, allowing me to see which blocks were allocated and of what size they are. My question is, is there a way to find out where the blocks were allocated? I know it is possible because if the memory wasn't freed a stack trace gets printed. Is there a way to 'poke' at fastmm to get it to print the stack trace for a given allocation? Side question: if the start address of an allocation is known, is there a way to find out which class the object is? (assuming that the allocation was for a object.

@TITLE:Matching binary patterns in C
@CONTENT:I'm currently developing a C program that needs to parse some bespoke data structures, fortunately I know how they are structured, however I'm not sure of how to implement my parser in C. Each of the structures are 32-bits in length, and each structure can be identified by it's binary signature. As an example, there are two particular structures that I'm interested in, and they have the following binary patterns (x means either 0 or 1)  0000-00xx-xxxx-xxx0
 0000-10xx-10xx-xxx0
 Within these structures the 'x' bits contain the actual data I need, so essentially I need a way of identifying each structure based on how the bits are written within each structure. So as an example in pseudo-code: if (binaryPattern = 000010xxxxxxxxx0) {
do something with it;
}
 I'm guessing that reading them as ints, and then performing some kind of bitmasking would be the way to go, but my knowledge of C isn't great, and maybe a simple logical OR operation would do it, but I just wanted some advice on doing this before I start. Thanks Thanks very much to everyone that has answered, very helpful!!

@TITLE:Zipping 2 arrays in ruby in random locations
@CONTENT:Is there an easy way to zip 2 arrays in random locations and keep their original order? for example a=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


b=["one","two","three","four"]
 and a random number from 0 to 5 with rand(5) zipped = [0,"one",1,2,3,"two",4,"three",5,6,7,8,"four",9,10]
 and the random series would be 1,3,1,4 as location to where to "zip" each element of b into a The best I could do is i=0
merged=a
b.each do |x|
rnd = rand(5)
merged.insert(i+rnd,x)
i=i+rnd
end
@CODE:a=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

@TITLE:How can I spawn an IPython qtconsole within my app while passing existing objects to that console
@CONTENT:I am trying to embed an IPython qtconsole in my application, in a similar way that I can embed an IPython text console, thus: from IPython.frontend.terminal.embed import InteractiveShellEmbed
myobj={'jason':10}
shell = InteractiveShellEmbed()
shell.user_ns = myobj
shell()
 I can start a QT console in my application by using from IPython.frontend.qt.console.qtconsoleapp import IPythonQtConsoleApp
app = IPythonQtConsoleApp()
app.initialize()
app.start()
 But this has no access to existing objects. I can start a kernel in my application which has access to existing objects, using: import IPython
myobj={'jason':10}
IPython.embed_kernel(local_ns=myobj)
#No more code executes
 And then connect to it using ipython qtconsole --existing
 Or, in another python script: from IPython.lib.kernel import find_connection_file
from IPython.frontend.qt.console.qtconsoleapp import IPythonQtConsoleApp

cf=find_connection_file("*")
app = IPythonQtConsoleApp(existing=cf[-1])
app.initialize()
app.start()
 But these are not monolithic solutions, both require another shell. The kernel runs in a thread that does not yield, so no more code executes until the kernel exists. So, my question is, how can I achieve the above in one script? I've tried using threads and multiprocessing, but as embed_kernel() never returns and obviously must be run before IPythonQTConsoleApp() or the connection file would be missing, I don't see how to manage this. P.S. Will somebody with a rep of >1000 please add a qtconsole tag.
@CODE:from IPython.frontend.terminal.embed import InteractiveShellEmbed
myobj={'jason':10}
shell = InteractiveShellEmbed()
shell.user_ns = myobj

@TITLE:Can you have a pointer to member to a member of a union?
@CONTENT:All descriptions that I can find talk about "pointer to member" in the context of a class. Unions are very similar to structures, and in particular have members too. Can you have a pointer to those members too? E.g. union x {
    int a;
    float b;
};
int x::*p = &x::a;
 I'm not talking about pointer to the union as a whole, pointers as members of a union, etc. p in the example above would really be an offset, obviously of size 0. I'd need this construct to answer this question.
@CODE:union x {
    int a;
    float b;
};
int x::*p = &x::a; p &x int * a

@LINK:/questions/14370929/how-do-i-keep-two-git-repositories-in-sync
@TITLE:How do I keep two git repositories in sync?
@CONTENT:Here is the scenario. I have two machines, "desktop" and "laptop". On desktop I do: mkdir git_test
cd git_test
git init
dd if=/dev/urandom of=test.img bs=1k count=1000
git add test.img
git commit -m "Added first image"
 Then on laptop I do: git clone [USER]@desktop:/home/[USER]/git_test    
cd git_test
dd if=/dev/urandom of=test2.img bs=1k count=1000
git add test2.img
git commit -m "Added second image"
 Then I want the git repo on my desktop to look like the git repo on my laptop. On the laptop, I issue the following: git push origin master But then I get: remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master
remote: error: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
remote: error: is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent
remote: error: with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match

remote: error: 
remote: error: To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set

 How do I keep these two repos in sync? The error messages seem to imply that git has the functionality that I desire, but for some reason it seems to be a more advanced workflow. I heard someone say once that you can't push to the branch you are currently on, can someone elaborate on that as a possible solution? I would have no problem with a solution of that nature, ie, I could work on a certain branch on my laptop, and a different branch on my desktop, and then just sync those up somehow so they are identical. Please note the following! I do not want to use a centralized repo, like github, for several reasons. The first is security. The second is simplicity. The third is that due to circumstances I won't go into here, I can't count on having an internet connection to some remote server, I just have my two machines connected via LAN. Finally, I want to learn how to do things the way I requested here, as to gain that specific piece of knowledge. I also do not want to use a bare repo, as a bare repo has a bunch of cruft in the root dir. This is ugly and messy. The whole reason I moved to git from subversion is that git looked like a much cleaner, decentralized solution. Also, I have some somewhat non-technical people that will be operating in the root dir of the desktop, they will get quite confused by the cruft. The beauty of git is (I thought) that everything hides in .git folders. Edit: Apparently I wasn't clear enough with this point. Imagine I have a "Documents" folder with the following sub folders: mydata1 and mydata2. This isn't a contrived example, this is exactly the issue I am trying to deal with. mydata1 should contain "test.img" and that file only, but instead it now has: branches config description HEAD hooks info objects refs I wanted to be able to just cd into mydata1 and start editing files, but instead I have to try and cd through branches, or whatever even just to get work done. And to have this sort of directory structure for every subfolder that was in "documents" is just unworkable. Please, please don't tell me to do things this way. Please just answer the question. Thanks. These two points are the entire reason I am posting this question here. Please only reply if you have an answer to this question. :) Thanks!!

@TITLE:Can't get IIS 7/Coldfusion to deliver 404
@CONTENT:So... we have a custom CMS. We have a rewrite rule that any page request (when a file doesn't exist) goes to the root/index.cfm file. There we search our DB for the page in question. If the page exists, we serve up the correct template,etc. If the page doesn't exist I want to server up a 404 page. Now I "think" I cannot do this in IIS since I need to handle the request in CF, so it has to get through. The file will always exist. When the page doesn't exist I've tried using <cfheader statusCode="404" > and then include some html, it puts The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. at the top of the page before my html. In order to get it to display the page I had to remove the 404 status code handler from IIS. In addition when I fetch as Google, it get's a 301. However when I view response headers in Firefox I get.

404 Not Found
 I've tried a combination of redirecting and all sorts of things. I open to letting IIS handle the 404, if there is a way, but I cannot figure out how to get Coldfusion to correctly deliver a 404 so Google gets it right. Webmaster tools gets mad at me because I am delivering "Soft 404s" before this point, so I am trying to fix that. I've also tried setting <httpErrors existingResponse="PassThrough" /> whatever the hell that does, but didn't work either. I've been looking up other threads trying to figure this out and just can't. EDIT: Looking further into this, viewing the header info in both Firebug & Chrome I clearly see the headers say 404. Why would Fetch as Bing and Fetch as Google say differently? I tested the fact that if I add .cfm to the URLs, it Fetch as Google will deliver see 404. However without the .cfm, it thinks it's 301. Firebug sees both as 404. This seems like a Google issue. ANSWER Kind of: So I was doing more testing this morning (Right after I added a bounty actually), and I noticed in webmaster tools, Google correctly noted one of my pages as a 404. So I started looking into it. I have an "Add Trailing Slash Rule". Google notices domain.com/page as a 301 (Correct I guess) to domain.com/page/. But it does notice domain.com/page/ as a 404. I think using the trailing slash rule as I have it is the right way, however, should I be doing something different, or is using the redirect with the slash the "correct" way of doing things, even though Google wants to ding me for it sometimes.

@TITLE:How to setCurrentPage in ViewPager according to user selection & how do I know which list item called the activity
@CONTENT:I'm new to Android programming. I have a list of items, when the user clicks on an item it takes them to a screen with that item details. I want the user to have the ability to swipe right and left to view other items' details in the list, instead of going back to the list and choosing another item. I read that I need to use ViewPager for the ability to swipe right and left, so I did that. ViewPager works fine, but my problem when I click any item on the list I always get to the first page in the ViewPager. I don't want that, what I want is if I click on item 4 on the list it takes me to page 4 in the view pager and still have the ability to swipe right and left to view the details of other items.

@TITLE:CSS Animations stall when running javascript function
@CONTENT:Let's say I have this javascript function:    function pauseComp(ms) {
     var date = new Date();
     var curDate = null;
     do { curDate = new Date(); }

 and a css3 animation (for instance, <i class="icon-spinner icon-spin"></i> from the new font-awesome 3). When I run the javascript function above, it stops the spinner while the function is running. See what I'm talking about here. Basically, javascript stops css animations, and I'm wondering why, or if anyone else has noticed this/found a workaround. I've tried putting it in a setTimeout(fn,0), where fn is the long process, but then realized why that will also not work (js is not multithreaded). Anyone seen this happening? Update: Interestingly, it looks like this isn't as much of a problem in Safari, although interaction with the browser interface is still being affected.

@TITLE:Binding Command of Button in AppBar does not work
@CONTENT:Why does the Command in the following example not execute? I have a named Page with an AppBar and a Button in it:    <Page
    x:Class="App13.MainPage"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"

           <Button Content="OK" Command="{Binding OkCommand, ElementName=myPage}" />
        </AppBar>
    </Page.BottomAppBar>
</Page>
 The Command "OkCommand" is defined in the code-behind like this (using MVVM light framework): public RelayCommand OkCommand
{
    get
    {
        return m_OkCommand
            ?? (m_OkCommand = new RelayCommand(
                                  async () =>
                                  {
                                      await new MessageDialog("OkCommand").ShowAsync();
                                  }));
    }
}
 There are no binding-errors nor any other hints in the output-window that give me an idea why this does not work. (Aside: if the button is placed outside the AppBar, everything works fine) Does anyone have an idea what is wrong here?

@TITLE:Capybara and before(:all) in rspec
@CONTENT:Here's my complete spec: require 'spec_helper'

describe "Idea page", js: true do

  subject { page }

  before(:all) do
    create(:idea)
    visit root_path
    click_link "Log In"
  end

        click_link "Claim"
      end
      it {should have_selector('a', text:'Claimed')}
    end

  end
end
 Without (:all) (i.e, when it's just before in the first block), the browser opens, clicks on the Login link, goes to the right page, and clicks on the link. Nice. But then it does it all over again before it tries clicking the second link ("Claim"), which is both time-consuming and error-prone. So I tried to fix this with before(:all). But now, it just pops open Firefox, waits for a moment, and closes it again without doing anything. Test fails say: Failures:

  1) Idea page Single idea 
     Failure/Error: page.find(:xpath, '//*[@id="accordion"]/div/div[1]/a').click

 Obviously, since the browser page was blank. What am I missing? Thank you. Edit: Maybe there's something basic I don't understand. With before(:each) here's what the test tries to do: 1) Log in to the webapp, make sure there's a 'Claim' button. 2) Log in to the webapp again, open the accordion again, and now click that 'Claim` button to see what's going to happen. So the beginning of every step is exactly the same, the browser doing the same thing again and again. Is that how it's supposed to be? If so, why do I get errors when I do this? Specifically, with before(:each) I get this: Failures:

 Even though I see the browser clicking the button, turning it to "Claimed", and there is no modal dialog shown. Edit 2: I stand corrected! There was a modal dialog there after all! I fixed the JS to stop showing it, and the test now passes. I still think it's weird that the framework has to repeat the whole sequence from scratch every step (seems like a waste of work), but whatever. Thank you!

@TITLE:Partial branch or partial merge or other way to help me to sync dotfiles?
@CONTENT:I don't know how to make my requirement short in title, sorry if it is not meaningful. I will explain here: Many people put their dotfiles on bitbucket or github, to ease later installation or configuration, sync over different pc. I did the same, however I want to do something special, I am not sure how mecurial/git could help. What I have: I have 3 machines, say Home, Office and Client, all linux OS (could be different distributions). To make the example simple, say I just want to put one file the .zshrc into repo. The problem is, the three OS have different system variables(or other settings). e.g. Office has JBOSS installed, then in .zshrc I need export JBOSS_HOME var. Client has Oracle installed, then export different set of vars. Office has to export HTTP_PROXY, but HOME not, Client needs it too, but different proxy value etc. Now what I did is, I extract those machine specific settings (mostly export, alias statement) to another file, say myVar.sh. and source it at the end of the .zshrc. So 3 machines have common part (same .zshrc), and different parts (myVar.sh). What I want: on any machine, if I found some nice settings, I change the .zshrc file (common part) and push. The changes should be easily sync to other machines (by pull, for example) if I changed the myVar.sh (different part) on HOME, and push, it should not affect Office's myVar.sh if I do pull on Office machine. What I am doing: now I have one Repo on bitBucket, and three branches (H,O,C). On Home PC, I just play with Home branch. Same for Office, Client. The problem is, if I changed the common part on one pc, the change is in its own branch, a little bit difficult to sync to the other two. Because I would never merge those branches. I also think about to mk different directories for different pc. e.g. /.zshrc
|--/HOME/myVar.sh
|--/Office/myVar.sh
|--/Client/myVar.sh
 and write shell script, e.g. check $HOST to decide writing myVar.sh to which directory. but I doubt that if it is the best way to achieve my goal. And when I look my dotfiles dir, I see all 3 pcs' setting. I should be careful and enter the correct one to read the file. In real world, the common part contains much more than .zhsrc (tmux,vimrc,xdefault..), so does the different part. I don't know can we somehow make a partial branch or do a partial merge on a repository... I use hg much more than git, if hg can solve it I would prefer hg, if not, git is also acceptable. I don't have much git experience except for clone, push, pull, up, merge,ci. now, how should I do? and, thank you for reading this... EDIT more about the different part I would thank you all guys for giving me answers. As I said above, the different part in my real machines is not as simple as myVar.sh. For example, I take my company-laptop (Office) to different clients (There are about 6 clients, not all clients provide us PCs, it is good because I could work with Linux everywhere), and configured printers for each by cups. I would put those configurations in Repo too. Because if one day I have to refresh my system, or harddisk failed, I could setup those printers very easy. Other things that belongs to different part but I cannot simply "source xxx" like Xorg.conf for trackpoint .hgrc file (since in company we have our own repo, uid, pwd, proxy..) some pre-configured systemd modules, basically .conf files. But machine specific, e.g. radeon.conf only for my Home laptop. And Client pc has no systemd installed at all. That's why I thought about different directory for PCs. As I said right now I am with 3 branches way, and have a myConf directory, within this directory I have getConf.sh, to copy dotfiles, different confs etc to myConf. In fact the getConf.sh belongs to different part too, because the script is not same for all pcs. Therefore I think the if-else/switch then source may not work in this case. Yesterday I just took the .zshrc, and try to make the example simple. If it mislead you guys, sorry about that.
@CODE:.zshrc .zshrc myVar.sh .zshrc .zshrc myVar.sh .zshrc myVar.sh myVar.sh /.zshrc
|--/HOME/myVar.sh
|--/Office/myVar.sh

@TITLE:How to avoid having to manually evaluate defrecords and defprotocols while unit testing in Clojure?
@CONTENT:In my Clojure codebase, I have defined several protocols and several defrecords. I am using clojure.test to unit test the concrete functions defined within my defrecords. For example, let's say I have the following source files: In src/foo/protocols.clj: (ns foo.protocols)

(defprotocol RequestAcceptability
  (desired-accepted-charset [this]))
 In src/foo/types.clj: (ns foo.types
  (:use [foo.protocols :only [RequestAcceptability desired-accepted-charset]])

(defrecord RequestProcessor
  [field-1 field-2]
  RequestAcceptability
  (desired-accepted-charset [this]
    ...implementation here...))
 In test/foo/types_test.clj: (ns foo.types-test
  (:use [clojure.test])
  (:use [foo.protocols :only [RequestAcceptability desired-accepted-charset]])
  (:import [foo.types RequestProcessor]))

(deftest test-desired-accepted-charset_1
  ...test code here...)
 I am using Clojure 1.4, Leiningen 2, nrepl within Emacs. The annoyance I am facing is that when I go to run my unit tests (e.g., using C-c C-, sequence), I get a ClassNotFoundException: foo.types.RequestProcessor. To get around this, I'm doing the manual work of evaluating, individually, each of my protocol and defrecord forms. I.e., I'll navigate over to my protocols.clj and evaluate (C-M-x key sequence for nrepl) my defprotocol form; and then I'll navigate to my types.clj and evaluate my defrecord form; and then finally I'm able to successfully run my unit tests w/out getting the ClassNotFoundException. Of course, in my real code base, I have to do this for all my protocols and defrecords, and so it is very tedious and time consuming. Also, if I simply drop to a shell and do lein test, I get the same ClassNotFoundException. Is there a better way? Thank you for your time and help.
@CODE:(ns foo.protocols)

@TITLE:Java : detect triple-click without firing double-click
@CONTENT:I have a JTable in which I want to call a function when a cell is double-clicked and call another function when the cell is triple-clicked. When the cell is triple-clicked I do not want to call the double-click-function. What I have right now is (mgrdAlarm is the JTable) : mgrdAlarm.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()
{
  public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)
  {
    System.out.println("getClickCount() = " + e.getClickCount());
    if (e.getClickCount()==2)
    {
      doubleClick();
      System.out.println("Completed : doubleClick()");
    }
    if (e.getClickCount()==3)
    {
      tripleClick();
      System.out.println("Completed : tripleClick()");
    }
  }
});
 When double-clicked the console shows : getClickCount() = 1
getClickCount() = 2
Completed : doubleClick()
 When triple-clicked the console shows : getClickCount() = 1
getClickCount() = 2
Completed : doubleClick()
getClickCount() = 3
Completed : tripleClick()
 When triple-clicked I want the console to show : getClickCount() = 1
getClickCount() = 2
getClickCount() = 3
Completed : tripleClick()
 So I do not want to call the function doubleClick() when the cell is triple-clicked, but I do want to call the function doubleClick() when the cell is double-clicked. [EDIT] As all replies suggest the solution seems to be to delay the double-click-action and wait a certain time for the triple-click. But as discussed here that might lead to a different type of problem : The user might have set his double-click-time quite long, which might overlap with the timeout of my triple-click. It is no real disaster if my double-click-action is executed before my triple-click-action, but it does generate some extra overhead, and especially some extra data traffic which I would like to prevent. As the only solution so far might lead to other problems, which might actually be worse than the original problem, I will leave it as it is right now.
@CODE:mgrdAlarm.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()
{
  public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)
  {
    System.out.println("getClickCount() = " + e.getClickCount());

@TITLE:Nginx proxy redirect to another URI
@CONTENT:Our site is an image repository of sorts. Each image has the notion of an external URL and an internal URL. External URL's are seen by clients and they change as we experiment with SEO. The internal URL's are permanent URL's that point to our image hosting service. We use our Ruby on Rails app to provide the URL translation. Here's an example of a request: --------           -----     -------     -------          ------------

--------           -----     -------     -------          ------------
 The architecture is working, but streaming the image through RoR is inefficient. I want to have Nginx do the proxying. That's what it's for. The proposed architecture would look something like this: --------           -----     -------         -------
|      | --eURL--> |   | --> |     | ------> | RoR |

 What response can I send to Nginx to have it proxy the data? I don't mind adding Nginx modules to my infrastructure and of course I'm open to changing my nginx.conf. X-Sendfile is the closest thing I've found, but that only allows streaming from the local filesystem. Maybe there is some other obscure HTTP response header or status code I'm unaware of.

@TITLE:Platform-specific IoC in MVVMCross
@CONTENT:I'm giving a MVVMCross a spin, to see if it will be of use in some bigger projects coming up, and it's great. I like the navigation, viewModel location and general cross-platform approach, which is just what I need. However, I'm a bit stuck on splitting out some of the dependency injection depending on the platform. So, we have the basic application, with a shared portable library, that initialises the service references when starting up:     public TwitterSearchApp()
    {
        InitaliseServices();
    }

    private void InitaliseServices()
    {
        this.RegisterServiceInstance<ITwitterSearchProvider>(new TwitterSearchProvider());
    }
 Fine. That defines the service implementations that will be used across all the platforms. But what about the situation where I will need different implementations on different platforms - for instance perhaps storage/caching, where the core requirement is the same, but needs to be handled differently on a phone than on a tablet. I thought it might go in Setup somewhere: public class Setup : MvxBaseWinRTSetup
    {
        public Setup(Frame rootFrame): base(rootFrame)
        {
        }

        protected override MvxApplication CreateApp()
        {
            var app = new TwitterSearchApp();//set platorm specific IoC here maybe?
            return app;
        }

        protected override void AddPluginsLoaders(Cirrious.MvvmCross.Platform.MvxLoaderPluginRegistry loaders)
        { // or perhaps here?
            loaders.AddConventionalPlugin<Cirrious.MvvmCross.Plugins.Visibility.WinRT.Plugin>();
            base.AddPluginsLoaders(loaders);
        }
    }
 but I'm not sure. I've seen the references to replacing the ViewModel locator, but is there are similar way of replacing the other IoC services? thanks, great job on the framework in general, I really like how it works (apart from this bit, which I don't understand properly yet) Toby
@CODE:public TwitterSearchApp()
    {
        InitaliseServices();
    }

    private void InitaliseServices()
    {
        this.RegisterServiceInstance<ITwitterSearchProvider>(new TwitterSearchProvider());
    } public class Setup : MvxBaseWinRTSetup
    {
        public Setup(Frame rootFrame): base(rootFrame)
        {
        }

        protected override MvxApplication CreateApp()
        {
            var app = new TwitterSearchApp();//set platorm specific IoC here maybe?
            return app;
        }

@TITLE:Knockout Validation of two interdependent fields
@CONTENT:Consider the following piece of code - var MyObjectModel = function(myObject){
var self = this;
self.myNumber1 = ko.observable(myObject.number1).trimmed();
self.myNumber2 = ko.observable(myObject.number2).trimmed();
 I would like to extend myNumber1 and myNumber2, to add knockout validations such that it throws an error if both are empty, and stays fine if either has a value. Any idea how I could go about achieving this ?

@TITLE:Why does isItemChecked() return true when in ActionMode?
@CONTENT:I've set up an ActionMode callback for use as the contextual ActionBar (CAB) within an ActionBarSherlock using project. I'm trying to set up multiple select so that I can delete multiple items in a ListView. I noticed while debugging, when the contextual ActionBar (CAB) is not open and I call isItemChecked() on a list item that I touch, it returns false as it should. But when the CAB IS open, items that I touch (that I haven't touched before) return true on calls to isItemChecked(). Then when I call delete on the array from getCheckedItemIds(), that array does not contain the items that were previously returning true for isItemChecked(). Has anyone seen this? @Override

@TITLE:How to make a serializable class that contains an instance of one class from a set of classes
@CONTENT:In .Net 4 or 4.5, how would you design a serializable class that contains an instance of one class from a set of classes? For instance, suppose I have a Garage class, which can hold an instance of any "vehicle" type classes, say Car, Boat, Motorcycle, Motorhome. But the Garage can only hold an instance of one of those classes. I have tried a few different ways of doing this, but my problem is to make it serializable. Here is a starting example where there is only one option for the instance in the Garage class. You should be able to plug it right into a new console app and try it. using System;

@TITLE:How can I know when a value is re-selected in a ComboBox?
@CONTENT:I am using a ComboBox to insert a text template into a RichEdit control (the name of the template is in the picklist for the ComboBox.) It all works great except when the user selects the same value in the list again. Then the SelectionChanged is not firing. That makes sense based on the name of the event (SelectionChanged), but I need to know that the value was re-selected so I can insert it again. Is there a way to know that an item was re-selected from the ComboBox? (Or a better control to use?) I tried using the DropDownClosed event, but that fires even if the item was not re-selected. (They open the drop down then click on another control.)

@TITLE:PredicateBuilder returning zero records
@CONTENT:I'm using PredicateBuilder to create a dynamic Where clause to query data from a DataTable. I have a Dictionary that contains my column names and values I need to search for. I'm simply iterating over the dictionary, if the key matches a column name, then add that key and value to the predicate. Everything seems to work fine until the actual query is run against the datatable, I get zero records back:( But if I replace the dynamic predicate with something like p => p["Year"] == "2010", I get records back. Here's the code: var objectList = table.AsEnumerable();
Func<DataRow, bool> predicate = GetPredicate(parms, table.Columns);

var list1 = objectList.Where(predicate).ToList();

private static Func<DataRow, bool> GetPredicate(Dictionary <string, string> parms, DataColumnCollection dataColumnCollection)
    {
        var predicate = PredicateBuilder.False<DataRow>();
        foreach (var parm in parms)

            }
        }
        return predicate.Compile();
    }
 Any help would be greatly appreciated:)

@LINK:/questions/14317503/qts-foreach-expression-requires-a-deep-copy
@TITLE:Qt's foreach expression requires a deep copy?
@CONTENT:I am having a bit of a problem with Qt's foreach function. I have a class Phrase, which is a subclass of QList. In ~Phrase I delete all of the GlossItem pointers. In iterating through the GlossItem pointers in Phrase, I would like to use Qt's foreach:     // phrase is a pointer to a Phrase object, 
    // which is a subclassed QList<GlossItem*>
    foreach( GlossItem *glossItem , *phrase )
    {
        // use glossItem
    }
 For some reason foreach is performing a deep copy on Phrase (I know this because it required me to implement the copy constructor). But if there is a copy of Phrase -- and if I don't want to create a deep copy of each GlossItem -- that means that those pointers will be deleted twice. (Or, deleted once, and then crash.) So I have to use this, which works but is less pretty.     for(int i=0; i<phrase->count(); i++ )
    {
        GlossItem *glossItem = phrase->at(i);
        // use glossItem
    }
 Is there a way around this or do I just need to live with it?

           <Button Content="OK" Command="{Binding OkCommand, ElementName=myPage}" />
        </AppBar>

</Page>
 The Command "OkCommand" is defined in the code-behind like this (using MVVM light framework): public RelayCommand OkCommand
{
    get
    {
        return m_OkCommand
            ?? (m_OkCommand = new RelayCommand(
                                  async () =>

                                  }));
    }
}
 There are no binding-errors nor any other hints in the output-window that give me an idea why this does not work. (Aside: if the button is placed outside the AppBar, everything works fine) Does anyone have an idea what is wrong here?

  end
end
 Without (:all) (i.e, when it's just before in the first block), the browser opens, clicks on the Login link, goes to the right page, and clicks on the link. Nice. But then it does it all over again before it tries clicking the second link ("Claim"), which is both time-consuming and error-prone. So I tried to fix this with before(:all). But now, it just pops open Firefox, waits for a moment, and closes it again without doing anything. Test fails say: Failures:

     Failure/Error: page.find(:xpath, '//*[@id="accordion"]/div/div[1]/a').click

 Obviously, since the browser page was blank. What am I missing? Thank you. Edit: Maybe there's something basic I don't understand. With before(:each) here's what the test tries to do: 1) Log in to the webapp, make sure there's a 'Claim' button. 2) Log in to the webapp again, open the accordion again, and now click that 'Claim` button to see what's going to happen. So the beginning of every step is exactly the same, the browser doing the same thing again and again. Is that how it's supposed to be? If so, why do I get errors when I do this? Specifically, with before(:each) I get this: Failures:

 Even though I see the browser clicking the button, turning it to "Claimed", and there is no modal dialog shown. Edit 2: I stand corrected! There was a modal dialog there after all! I fixed the JS to stop showing it, and the test now passes. I still think it's weird that the framework has to repeat the whole sequence from scratch every step (seems like a waste of work), but whatever. Thank you!

@TITLE:Partial branch or partial merge or other way to help me to sync dotfiles?
@CONTENT:I don't know how to make my requirement short in title, sorry if it is not meaningful. I will explain here: Many people put their dotfiles on bitbucket or github, to ease later installation or configuration, sync over different pc. I did the same, however I want to do something special, I am not sure how mecurial/git could help. What I have: I have 3 machines, say Home, Office and Client, all linux OS (could be different distributions). To make the example simple, say I just want to put one file the .zshrc into repo. The problem is, the three OS have different system variables(or other settings). e.g. Office has JBOSS installed, then in .zshrc I need export JBOSS_HOME var. Client has Oracle installed, then export different set of vars. Office has to export HTTP_PROXY, but HOME not, Client needs it too, but different proxy value etc. Now what I did is, I extract those machine specific settings (mostly export, alias statement) to another file, say myVar.sh. and source it at the end of the .zshrc. So 3 machines have common part (same .zshrc), and different parts (myVar.sh). What I want: on any machine, if I found some nice settings, I change the .zshrc file (common part) and push. The changes should be easily sync to other machines (by pull, for example) if I changed the myVar.sh (different part) on HOME, and push, it should not affect Office's myVar.sh if I do pull on Office machine. What I am doing: now I have one Repo on bitBucket, and three branches (H,O,C). On Home PC, I just play with Home branch. Same for Office, Client. The problem is, if I changed the common part on one pc, the change is in its own branch, a little bit difficult to sync to the other two. Because I would never merge those branches. I also think about to mk different directories for different pc. e.g. /.zshrc
|--/HOME/myVar.sh
|--/Office/myVar.sh
|--/Client/myVar.sh
 and write shell script, e.g. check $HOST to decide writing myVar.sh to which directory. but I doubt that if it is the best way to achieve my goal. And when I look my dotfiles dir, I see all 3 pcs' setting. I should be careful and enter the correct one to read the file. In real world, the common part contains much more than .zhsrc (tmux,vimrc,xdefault..), so does the different part. I don't know can we somehow make a partial branch or do a partial merge on a repository... I use hg much more than git, if hg can solve it I would prefer hg, if not, git is also acceptable. I don't have much git experience except for clone, push, pull, up, merge,ci. now, how should I do? and, thank you for reading this... EDIT more about the different part I would thank you all guys for giving me answers. As I said above, the different part in my real machines is not as simple as myVar.sh. For example, I take my company-laptop (Office) to different clients (There are about 6 clients, not all clients provide us PCs, it is good because I could work with Linux everywhere), and configured printers for each by cups. I would put those configurations in Repo too. Because if one day I have to refresh my system, or harddisk failed, I could setup those printers very easy. Other things that belongs to different part but I cannot simply "source xxx" like Xorg.conf for trackpoint .hgrc file (since in company we have our own repo, uid, pwd, proxy..) some pre-configured systemd modules, basically .conf files. But machine specific, e.g. radeon.conf only for my Home laptop. And Client pc has no systemd installed at all. That's why I thought about different directory for PCs. As I said right now I am with 3 branches way, and have a myConf directory, within this directory I have getConf.sh, to copy dotfiles, different confs etc to myConf. In fact the getConf.sh belongs to different part too, because the script is not same for all pcs. Therefore I think the if-else/switch then source may not work in this case. Yesterday I just took the .zshrc, and try to make the example simple. If it mislead you guys, sorry about that.
@CODE:.zshrc .zshrc myVar.sh .zshrc .zshrc myVar.sh .zshrc myVar.sh myVar.sh /.zshrc
|--/HOME/myVar.sh
|--/Office/myVar.sh
|--/Client/myVar.sh myVar.sh myVar.sh myConf getConf.sh myConf getConf.sh if-else/switch source .zshrc if source ...

@TITLE:How to avoid having to manually evaluate defrecords and defprotocols while unit testing in Clojure?
@CONTENT:In my Clojure codebase, I have defined several protocols and several defrecords. I am using clojure.test to unit test the concrete functions defined within my defrecords. For example, let's say I have the following source files: In src/foo/protocols.clj: (ns foo.protocols)

(defprotocol RequestAcceptability
  (desired-accepted-charset [this]))
 In src/foo/types.clj: (ns foo.types
  (:use [foo.protocols :only [RequestAcceptability desired-accepted-charset]])

(defrecord RequestProcessor
  [field-1 field-2]
  RequestAcceptability
  (desired-accepted-charset [this]
    ...implementation here...))
 In test/foo/types_test.clj: (ns foo.types-test
  (:use [clojure.test])
  (:use [foo.protocols :only [RequestAcceptability desired-accepted-charset]])
  (:import [foo.types RequestProcessor]))

(deftest test-desired-accepted-charset_1
  ...test code here...)
 I am using Clojure 1.4, Leiningen 2, nrepl within Emacs. The annoyance I am facing is that when I go to run my unit tests (e.g., using C-c C-, sequence), I get a ClassNotFoundException: foo.types.RequestProcessor. To get around this, I'm doing the manual work of evaluating, individually, each of my protocol and defrecord forms. I.e., I'll navigate over to my protocols.clj and evaluate (C-M-x key sequence for nrepl) my defprotocol form; and then I'll navigate to my types.clj and evaluate my defrecord form; and then finally I'm able to successfully run my unit tests w/out getting the ClassNotFoundException. Of course, in my real code base, I have to do this for all my protocols and defrecords, and so it is very tedious and time consuming. Also, if I simply drop to a shell and do lein test, I get the same ClassNotFoundException. Is there a better way? Thank you for your time and help.

@TITLE:Java : detect triple-click without firing double-click
@CONTENT:I have a JTable in which I want to call a function when a cell is double-clicked and call another function when the cell is triple-clicked. When the cell is triple-clicked I do not want to call the double-click-function. What I have right now is (mgrdAlarm is the JTable) : mgrdAlarm.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()
{
  public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)
  {
    System.out.println("getClickCount() = " + e.getClickCount());
    if (e.getClickCount()==2)
    {
      doubleClick();
      System.out.println("Completed : doubleClick()");
    }
    if (e.getClickCount()==3)
    {
      tripleClick();
      System.out.println("Completed : tripleClick()");
    }
  }
});
 When double-clicked the console shows : getClickCount() = 1
getClickCount() = 2
Completed : doubleClick()
 When triple-clicked the console shows : getClickCount() = 1
getClickCount() = 2
Completed : doubleClick()
getClickCount() = 3
Completed : tripleClick()
 When triple-clicked I want the console to show : getClickCount() = 1
getClickCount() = 2
getClickCount() = 3
Completed : tripleClick()
 So I do not want to call the function doubleClick() when the cell is triple-clicked, but I do want to call the function doubleClick() when the cell is double-clicked. [EDIT] As all replies suggest the solution seems to be to delay the double-click-action and wait a certain time for the triple-click. But as discussed here that might lead to a different type of problem : The user might have set his double-click-time quite long, which might overlap with the timeout of my triple-click. It is no real disaster if my double-click-action is executed before my triple-click-action, but it does generate some extra overhead, and especially some extra data traffic which I would like to prevent. As the only solution so far might lead to other problems, which might actually be worse than the original problem, I will leave it as it is right now.
@CODE:mgrdAlarm.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()
{
  public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)
  {
    System.out.println("getClickCount() = " + e.getClickCount());

@LINK:/questions/14350461/nginx-proxy-redirect-to-another-uri
@TITLE:Nginx proxy redirect to another URI
@CONTENT:Our site is an image repository of sorts. Each image has the notion of an external URL and an internal URL. External URL's are seen by clients and they change as we experiment with SEO. The internal URL's are permanent URL's that point to our image hosting service. We use our Ruby on Rails app to provide the URL translation. Here's an example of a request: --------           -----     -------     -------          ------------
|      | --eURL--> |   | --> |     | --> |     | -iURL--> |          |
|client|           |CDN|     |Nginx|     | RoR |          |Image Host|
|      | <-------- |   | <-- |     | <-- |     | <-IMG--- |          |
--------           -----     -------     -------          ------------
 The architecture is working, but streaming the image through RoR is inefficient. I want to have Nginx do the proxying. That's what it's for. The proposed architecture would look something like this: --------           -----     -------         -------
|      | --eURL--> |   | --> |     | ------> | RoR |
|client|           |CDN|     |Nginx| <-????- |     |
|      | <-------- |   | <-- |     |         -------
--------           -----     |     |         ------------
                             |     | -iURL-> |Image Host|
                             |     | <-IMG-- |          |
                             -------         ------------
 What response can I send to Nginx to have it proxy the data? I don't mind adding Nginx modules to my infrastructure and of course I'm open to changing my nginx.conf. X-Sendfile is the closest thing I've found, but that only allows streaming from the local filesystem. Maybe there is some other obscure HTTP response header or status code I'm unaware of.

</div>
 I'm looking for a way to get the starting position (including whitespace) of each <p> tag, here: 7 and 72. It'd be great if a PHP parser supported that natively (I've looked at DOM, XMLReader, and other libraries mentionned in this SO question but haven't found a way to do it), but otherwise any language/framework would be fine. Note: Related to this question, but less localized.

 I'm interested in key press event handlers with modifiers (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, Shift) in matplotlib/pyplot. This part of the docs mentions some support for modifiers. But when I use the code above I don't see that behaviour. I would prefer to avoid having to handle the modifiers manually with maintaining state about those key press / release events; for example, I want to be able to easily distinguish between a and ctrl+a without having to maintain a state about control up/down. -Am I missing some higher level interface somewhere, where modifiers just work? -Or perhaps that part of the docs only applies to GTKAgg backend, when I generally use TkAgg? -Maybe the support for modifiers perhaps something which was added recently, and isn't in my matplotlib version 1.1.1rc?

@TITLE:Platform-specific IoC in MVVMCross
@CONTENT:I'm giving a MVVMCross a spin, to see if it will be of use in some bigger projects coming up, and it's great. I like the navigation, viewModel location and general cross-platform approach, which is just what I need. However, I'm a bit stuck on splitting out some of the dependency injection depending on the platform. So, we have the basic application, with a shared portable library, that initialises the service references when starting up:     public TwitterSearchApp()
    {
        InitaliseServices();
    }

    private void InitaliseServices()
    {
        this.RegisterServiceInstance<ITwitterSearchProvider>(new TwitterSearchProvider());
    }
 Fine. That defines the service implementations that will be used across all the platforms. But what about the situation where I will need different implementations on different platforms - for instance perhaps storage/caching, where the core requirement is the same, but needs to be handled differently on a phone than on a tablet. I thought it might go in Setup somewhere: public class Setup : MvxBaseWinRTSetup
    {
        public Setup(Frame rootFrame): base(rootFrame)
        {
        }

        protected override MvxApplication CreateApp()
        {
            var app = new TwitterSearchApp();//set platorm specific IoC here maybe?
            return app;
        }

        protected override void AddPluginsLoaders(Cirrious.MvvmCross.Platform.MvxLoaderPluginRegistry loaders)
        { // or perhaps here?
            loaders.AddConventionalPlugin<Cirrious.MvvmCross.Plugins.Visibility.WinRT.Plugin>();
            base.AddPluginsLoaders(loaders);
        }
    }
 but I'm not sure. I've seen the references to replacing the ViewModel locator, but is there are similar way of replacing the other IoC services? thanks, great job on the framework in general, I really like how it works (apart from this bit, which I don't understand properly yet) Toby

@CONTENT:Consider the following piece of code - var MyObjectModel = function(myObject){
var self = this;
self.myNumber1 = ko.observable(myObject.number1).trimmed();
self.myNumber2 = ko.observable(myObject.number2).trimmed();
 I would like to extend myNumber1 and myNumber2, to add knockout validations such that it throws an error if both are empty, and stays fine if either has a value. Any idea how I could go about achieving this ?

@TITLE:Why does isItemChecked() return true when in ActionMode?
@CONTENT:I've set up an ActionMode callback for use as the contextual ActionBar (CAB) within an ActionBarSherlock using project. I'm trying to set up multiple select so that I can delete multiple items in a ListView. I noticed while debugging, when the contextual ActionBar (CAB) is not open and I call isItemChecked() on a list item that I touch, it returns false as it should. But when the CAB IS open, items that I touch (that I haven't touched before) return true on calls to isItemChecked(). Then when I call delete on the array from getCheckedItemIds(), that array does not contain the items that were previously returning true for isItemChecked(). Has anyone seen this? @Override

@TITLE:How to make a serializable class that contains an instance of one class from a set of classes
@CONTENT:In .Net 4 or 4.5, how would you design a serializable class that contains an instance of one class from a set of classes? For instance, suppose I have a Garage class, which can hold an instance of any "vehicle" type classes, say Car, Boat, Motorcycle, Motorhome. But the Garage can only hold an instance of one of those classes. I have tried a few different ways of doing this, but my problem is to make it serializable. Here is a starting example where there is only one option for the instance in the Garage class. You should be able to plug it right into a new console app and try it. using System;

@TITLE:How can I know when a value is re-selected in a ComboBox?
@CONTENT:I am using a ComboBox to insert a text template into a RichEdit control (the name of the template is in the picklist for the ComboBox.) It all works great except when the user selects the same value in the list again. Then the SelectionChanged is not firing. That makes sense based on the name of the event (SelectionChanged), but I need to know that the value was re-selected so I can insert it again. Is there a way to know that an item was re-selected from the ComboBox? (Or a better control to use?) I tried using the DropDownClosed event, but that fires even if the item was not re-selected. (They open the drop down then click on another control.)

@TITLE:PredicateBuilder returning zero records
@CONTENT:I'm using PredicateBuilder to create a dynamic Where clause to query data from a DataTable. I have a Dictionary that contains my column names and values I need to search for. I'm simply iterating over the dictionary, if the key matches a column name, then add that key and value to the predicate. Everything seems to work fine until the actual query is run against the datatable, I get zero records back:( But if I replace the dynamic predicate with something like p => p["Year"] == "2010", I get records back. Here's the code: var objectList = table.AsEnumerable();
Func<DataRow, bool> predicate = GetPredicate(parms, table.Columns);

var list1 = objectList.Where(predicate).ToList();

private static Func<DataRow, bool> GetPredicate(Dictionary <string, string> parms, DataColumnCollection dataColumnCollection)
    {
        var predicate = PredicateBuilder.False<DataRow>();
        foreach (var parm in parms)
        {
            if (dataColumnCollection.Contains(parm.Key))
            {
                var copy = parm;
                predicate = predicate.And(p => p[copy.Key] == copy.Value);
            }
        }
        return predicate.Compile();
    }
 Any help would be greatly appreciated:)

@LINK:/questions/14317503/qts-foreach-expression-requires-a-deep-copy
@TITLE:Qt's foreach expression requires a deep copy?
@CONTENT:I am having a bit of a problem with Qt's foreach function. I have a class Phrase, which is a subclass of QList. In ~Phrase I delete all of the GlossItem pointers. In iterating through the GlossItem pointers in Phrase, I would like to use Qt's foreach:     // phrase is a pointer to a Phrase object, 
    // which is a subclassed QList<GlossItem*>
    foreach( GlossItem *glossItem , *phrase )
    {
        // use glossItem
    }
 For some reason foreach is performing a deep copy on Phrase (I know this because it required me to implement the copy constructor). But if there is a copy of Phrase -- and if I don't want to create a deep copy of each GlossItem -- that means that those pointers will be deleted twice. (Or, deleted once, and then crash.) So I have to use this, which works but is less pretty.     for(int i=0; i<phrase->count(); i++ )
    {
        GlossItem *glossItem = phrase->at(i);
        // use glossItem
    }
 Is there a way around this or do I just need to live with it?
@CODE:// phrase is a pointer to a Phrase object, 
    // which is a subclassed QList<GlossItem*>
    foreach( GlossItem *glossItem , *phrase )
    {
        // use glossItem
    } for(int i=0; i<phrase->count(); i++ )
    {
        GlossItem *glossItem = phrase->at(i);
        // use glossItem
    } i QList

 If someone selects a checkbox and hits the submit button I have this code: jQuery(".deletebutton").on("click", function() {
    var testchecked = jQuery(':checkbox:checked').length;
    if (testchecked == 0) {
        alert('Please select at least one video');
        e.preventDefault();
    }
    else
    {
        if (confirm("Are you sure you want to delete the selected videos?"))
        {
            var checked = jQuery('input:checkbox:checked').map(function () {
                return this.value;
            }).get();
            var $this = jQuery(this);
            jQuery.ajax({
                type: 'POST',
                url: 'index.php?option=com_recordings&task=deletevideos&format=raw',
                data: {checkedarray:checked},
                success: function(data){
                    alert(data);

                }
            });
        }
    }
});
 Oddly this code works fine in IE (how's that for a change) but doesn't in Chrome or FF. If I check the error: error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
        if (jqXHR.status === 0) {
            alert("Not connected. Verify Network.");
        }
 It seems it always throws this alert. So why is it always 0? Here is the really odd thing. After much playing around if I change the form to be in the table it then works: <table id="webcam-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>...</th>
            <th><input type="checkbox" name="checkboxselectall" title="Select All" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <button type="submit" class="deletebutton" name="delete_video" title="Delete the selected videos">Delete</button></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
<form name="myform" action="">
... //the rest is the same
 This will then work in FF and Chrome but now IE fails to render the table properly. So this is not a solution (anyways it is not w3c valid code). So...any ideas? Anything I can try to debug this?
@CODE:<form name="myform" action="">
<table id="webcam-table">

@TITLE:SEVERE: Error in getRealPathFromConn
@CONTENT:Currently I am debugging a seemingly random error with our applications. I will attempt to try to provide as much detail as possible. Basically after a while, one of the application pools for an application on our server stops. I have to start it, or sometimes, restart Coldfusion or worse the machine to get things running again. The Server logs indicate the pool was stopped because of the Rapid Fail Succession thing in IIS. (The App serves X number of errors in a short amount of time so IIS stops the application) Going through the ColdFusion Error logs I get this one right around the time of the IIS error where it stops my Pool. SEVERE: Error in getRealPathFromConn java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer: socket write error at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native Method) at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite(SocketOutputStream.java:92) at java.net.SocketOutputStream.write(SocketOutputStream.java:124) at org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProcessor.getRealPathFromServer(AjpProcessor.java:391)... AND SO ON If you really need the full trace I can provide it, but it is long. I am not sure what the getRealPathFromConn is about. I've tried Googling, but haven't come up with a conclusion yet. In the traces they do lead to different files in various applications, but the lines in question seem to have nothing in common with one another. Any thoughts on what might be the cause or where I should look next would help a ton. EDIT: I forgot to say, I "believe" this started Monday. The only real thing that changed prior to Monday was the following. We have an app structure: root/app1/application.cfc
root/app2/application.cfc
root/app3/application.cfc
root/app3/website1
root/app3/website2
root/app3/website3
 I changed the structure so two of the websites have their own application.cfc because we are slowly rolling out a change in how the websites work. I am testing this on two of them for now. Since I made that change, the apppool that keeps crashing the the app pool for app1. Not any of the websites, but I feel like it could be related. UPDATE Updated Coldfusion to most recent version. (10,0,7,283649) Systems ran for about a week and this morning crashed. Coldfusion-error.log at that time: Jan 25, 2013 8:09:11 AM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init

@TITLE:Show hide elements based on ID from select dropdown javascript
@CONTENT:I know this is proboly the most asked question out there but I have scoured the net and tried several examples and none of them have worked. Here is my issue. First I have no control over the TR TD structure, can't use DIV. I need to be able to display certain TD's based on the select dropdown menu value. I have 4 different id's I am using "to", "to_field", "from", "from_field". The script I have shown is not working. Can someone help me out?

@CONTENT:Assertions provided by node.js assert for unit-testing are very limited. Even before I've written the first test I was already creating a few of assertions as it was clear I will keep re-using them. Could you recommend some good library of assertions to test for common javascript situations (object structures, objects classes, etc., etc.)? Ideally it should integrate well with nodeunit (or, better, extend it's assertions) - my assertions do not, I have to pass them test as an extra variable... The only one I've seen is Chai. What could you say about it?

@TITLE:Execute a particular command on multiple emacs buffers
@CONTENT:Is there a way to execute emacs command on multiple buffers without having to selecting them individually and executing it on each individual buffer. I usually open multiple files matching a particular regex, e.g. ~/*.py and wish to enable a particular mode, say hs-minor-mode or glasses-mode on each, or say execute C-c @ C-M-h on each. Currently I have to select each one of them and do it individually. So is there a hack or a loop to automate the task. Lets say I mark the buffers from the buffer-list and then run the command for all those marked. I tried this but after executing the commands in eval-expression I completely lost access to my minibuffer, meaning whenever I typed M-x the minibuffer returned this unable to access the minibuffer emacs error "Process Menu Mode doesn't support Hideshow Minor Mode" and I was forced to actually kill the entire emacs process because the C-x C-s wasn't working neither was the End Task.

@CONTENT:I need to create multiple excel sheet in Java using jExcel API if one sheet is full (65536 rows). Suppose if one sheet got full then in the next sheet it should start writing automatically from where it left off in the first sheet. I am just stuck on putting the logic to create it dynamically whenever one sheet is full. Below is the code that I have done so far. public void write() throws IOException, WriteException {
    File file = new File(inputFile);
    WorkbookSettings wbSettings = new WorkbookSettings();

    wbSettings.setLocale(new Locale("en", "EN"));

    WritableWorkbook workbook = Workbook.createWorkbook(file, wbSettings);

    writingToExcel(workbook);

        createContent(excelSheet);
    } catch (WriteException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        try {
            workbook.write();
            workbook.close();   
        } catch (IOException e) {

        } catch (WriteException e) {

    }
}

    times = new WritableCellFormat(times10pt);
    times.setWrap(true);

    WritableFont times10ptBoldUnderline = new WritableFont(WritableFont.TIMES, 10, WritableFont.BOLD, false,UnderlineStyle.SINGLE);

 I am not sure how to add that logic here in my code. Any suggestions will be of great help? Or in any case, can anyone provide me a simple example in which if one sheet is full, it should start writing automatically into different sheet (Second sheet)?

@TITLE:how to find the number of occurrences of a substring within a string vb.net
@CONTENT:I have a string (for example: "Hello there. My name is John. I work very hard. Hello there!") and I am trying to find the number of occurrences of the string "hello there". So far, this is the code I have: Dim input as String = "Hello there. My name is John. I work very hard. Hello there!"
Dim phrase as String = "hello there"
Dim Occurrences As Integer = 0

If input.toLower.Contains(phrase) = True Then
    Occurrences = input.Split(phrase).Length      
    'REM: Do stuff
End If
 Unfortunately, what this line of code seems to do is split the string every time it sees the first letter of phrase, in this case, h. So instead of the result Occurrences = 2 that I would hope for, I actually get a much larger number. I know that counting the number of splits in a string is a horrible way to go about doing this, even if I did get the correct answer, so could someone please help me out and provide some assistance?
@CODE:"Hello there. My name is John. I work very hard. Hello there!" "hello there" Dim input as String = "Hello there. My name is John. I work very hard. Hello there!"

If input.toLower.Contains(phrase) = True Then
    Occurrences = input.Split(phrase).Length

@TITLE:Expression Tree with string assignment and getting value
@CONTENT:I have built my own SQL Query builder that breaks apart an Expression, however, I'm having an issue trying to get the value of string defined in the same function as the lambda expression. Here is what I am trying to do in console app: private static void MyBuilderTest()
{
    var sqlBuilder = new SqlBuilder();

    // Doesn't work -- NEED GUIDANCE HERE
    var testValue = "Test";  // Defined in the same function as the lambda below

    sqlBuilder.Select<FooObject>(o => o.FooValue == testValue);

    // Works
    var someObject = new SomeObject { SomeValue = "classTest };

    sqlBuilder.Select<FooObject>(o => o.FooValue == someObject.SomeValue);
}
 In my builder it subclasses from ExpressionVisitor, and I override the VisitMember. I found that a string defined in at the base Console level will come back as: Node.Expression.NodeType == ExpressionType.Constant
 The Node.Expression passes back properties of: CanReduce = false
DebugView = ".Constant<ConsoleApplication1.Program+<>c__DisplayClass1>(ConsoleApplication1.Program+<>c__DisplayClass1)"
NodeType = Constant
Type = System.Type {System.RunetimeType}
Value = {ConsoleApplication1.Program}
 The Node.Expression.Value contains: testValue = "Test" (Type: string)
 How do I get this value? I've tried several things, like: var memberType = node.Expression.Type.DeclaringType;
 This passes back a ConsoleApplication1.Program type. However, when I do:  memberType.GetProperty("testValue");   // Declaring Type from Expression
 It passes back null. The above methods work fine if I place the lambda "strings" in a class, but doesn't work if they string is defined in the console function. Can anyone tell me how to get the string value if it's defined at the function level of the lambda? EDITED: Added VisitMember protected override Expression VisitMember(MemberExpression node)
{
    if (node.NodeType == ExpressionType.Constant)
    {
        // Node.Expression is a ConstantExpression type.
        // node.Expression contains properties above
        // And Has Value of:  {ConsoleApplication1.Program}
        // Expanding Value in Watch window shows:  testValue = "Test"

        // How do I get this value, if the ConsoleApplication1.Program type doesn't
        // even know about it?  Looks like maybe a dynamic property?
    }
 }
 EDITED Added code to the console app example to show what works and what doesn't.

@LINK:/questions/14264525/php-simple-html-dom-parser-select-only-divs-with-multiple-classes
@TITLE:PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser: Select only DIVs with multiple classes
@CONTENT:I was searching like mad and found no solution. The problem is simple. Let's say I have 3 DIVs: <div class="class1">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT1 </div>
</div>

<div class="class2">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT2 </div>
</div>

<div class="class1 class2">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT3 </div>
</div>
 So, very simple. I just want to find the TEXT3, which has BOTH class1 and class2. Using Simple HTML DOM Parser, I can't seem to get it to work. Here's what I tried: foreach($html->find("[class=class1], [class=class2]") as $item) {
$items[] =  $item->find('.subclass', 0)->plaintext;
}
 The problem is, with find("[class=class1], [class=class2]")
 it's finding all of them, as the comma is like an OR, if I leave the comma, it's looking for nested class2 inside class1. I am just looking for an AND... EDIT Thanks to 19greg96 I found out that div[class=class1 class2]
 works, the problem is that it looks for exactly those two in that order. Let's say I have <div class="class1 class2">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT3 </div>
</div>
 then it works, and if I have <div class="class1 class2 class3">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT3 </div>
</div>
 it works when I put an asterix, as it looks for the substring: div[class*=class1 class2]
 PROBLEM I know only that class1 and class3 is there, but maybe others and in random order. That still doesn't work. Any idea how to just look for A & B in any random order? So that div[class=class1 class3]
 works with that example?
@CODE:<div class="class1">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT1 </div>
</div>

<div class="class2">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT2 </div>
</div>

<div class="class1 class2">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT3 </div>
</div> foreach($html->find("[class=class1], [class=class2]") as $item) {
$items[] =  $item->find('.subclass', 0)->plaintext;
} find("[class=class1], [class=class2]") div[class=class1 class2] <div class="class1 class2">
  <div class="subclass"> TEXT3 </div>
</div> <div class="class1 class2 class3">

@TITLE:Fake unresolved import error in PyDev
@CONTENT:PyDev is reporting import errors which don't exist. The initial symptom was a fake "unresolved import" error, which was fixed by some combination of: Cleaning the Project Re-indexing the project (remove interpreter, add again) Restarting Eclipse Burning incense to the Python deities Now the error is "unverified variable from import"--it can't seem to find pymssql.connect. This IS NOT a PYHTONPATH problem. I can access the module just fine, the code in the file with the (alleged) error runs fine---it has unit tests and production code calling it. The error is somewhere in PyDev: I added a new module to my PyDev project, and the error only occurs in the new module. I've tried all of the above. So, I was planning on posting this code somewhere else to solicit some comments about the design, and I was asked in the comments to post code. (Inspired by: Database connection wrapper and Clint Miller's answer to this question: How do I correctly clean up a Python object?). The import error happens at line 69 (self.connection = pymssql.connect...). Not sure what good this does in answering the question, but... import pymssql

@TITLE:Add MKAnnotations on a MKMapView from NSArray of coordinates
@CONTENT:I need to add on my MKMapView several annotations (example one for each city in a country) and I don't want to initializate every CLLocation2D with latitude and longitude of all cities. I think it is possible with arrays, so this is my code: NSArray *latit = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"20", nil]; // <--- I cannot add more than ONE object
NSArray *longit = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"20", nil]; // <--- I cannot add more than ONE object

// I want to avoid code like location1.latitude, location2.latitude,... locationN.latitude...

CLLocationCoordinate2D location;
MKPointAnnotation *annotation = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];

for (int i=0; i<[latit count]; i++) {
    double lat = [[latit objectAtIndex:i] doubleValue];
    double lon = [[longit objectAtIndex:i] doubleValue];
    location.latitude = lat;
    location.longitude = lon;
    annotation.coordinate = location;
    [map addAnnotation: annotation];
}
 Ok, its all right if I leave ONE object in the NSArrays latit and longit, I have ONE annotation on the map; but if I add more than one object to the arrays app builds but crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1...). What's the problem, or what the best way to add several annotations without redundant code? Thank you!

@TITLE:Accuracy of ScheduledExecutorService on normal OS / JVM
@CONTENT:I use ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate to run a daily task, like this: executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, d, 24L * 3600 * 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 (d is the initial delay in milliseconds). The executor is created by Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor() and runs multiple tasks, but they are all scheduled a few hours apart, and take at most a few minutes. I know that ScheduledExecutorService makes no guarantees about accuracy, and I'd need a real-time OS and JVM to get that. That is not a requirement for my task, though. I noticed that on a Windows 2003 Server, using JDK 1.7.0_03, the task slips by almost 10 seconds per day. That makes about 5 minutes per month, which is acceptable for my application. I'll probably have to implement re-scheduling anyway, because I want the task to run at a specific local time, and so I'll have to take care of DST myself. The service runs for long periods of time - half a year without restart is not that unusual. Still, I think that an inaccuracy of 10 sec/day is rather high for a mostly idle system, and I wonder if I should be prepared for even worse behavior. So my question is about your experiences with scheduleAtFixedRate. Are the 10 sec/day normal? Will I get better or worse accuracy in other environments (our customers also use Linux and Solaris servers)? Or are the 10 seconds an indication that something is amiss in our environment?

@CONTENT:I want to add an outline or stroke to an editable UITextView text as the user types. Exactly like memes : http://t.qkme.me/3oi5rs.jpg I have to use a UITextView since I need multi line support. I have tried all the approaches and reached the conclusion that I must use CoreText. I got almost all of the solution working but got stuck at a point where the text in textview wraps. My drawRect routine in the subview of UITextView correctly draws the outline text until the text wraps. Even when the text user inputs is wrapped, the outline text that I draw does not. Here's my implementation of the drawRect method : https://gist.github.com/4498988. On line 29, I am using char wrapping : CTLineBreakMode linebreakmode = kCTLineBreakByCharWrapping;
 I have already tried the wordwrapping option (which is also the default) to no use. My question is : How do I get the text that I draw to wrap correctly so it appears as an outline to the typed text?

@TITLE:Javascript efficient search array for value with jQuery
@CONTENT:There's a gap in my JavaScript knowledge here. I want to search an array of objects values for a particular value and return it. For the year I have been writing JavaScript, I have been implementing it like this: var itemClicked = (function(){

  var retval;

  //Note self.inventory.itemsArray is an array of JS objects

  $(self.inventory.itemsArray).each(function(i){
    if(parseInt(this.id) === parseInt(idOfItem)){

    }
  });

  return retval;

})();
 It works, but I'm sure as anything there is a more elegant way. Tell me please! EDIT - Solution Thanks to @gdoron with his answer below. var myVar = $(self.owner.itemsArray).filter(function(){
   return parseInt(this.id) == parseInt(recItemID);
}).get(0);
 Note: .get(0) was added at the end because myVar is wrapped as a jQuery object.
@CODE:var itemClicked = (function(){

  var retval;

  //Note self.inventory.itemsArray is an array of JS objects

  $(self.inventory.itemsArray).each(function(i){
    if(parseInt(this.id) === parseInt(idOfItem)){

@CONTENT:I quite don't understand how the interface thing works in OCaml. Let's see an example: About the 'a So what the meaning of 'a here? I mean I understand that when describing the functions, 'a means arbitrary type. Then what's its meaning here? Does it mean arbitrary set? Also, Why put 'a in front of set? abstract When explaining this example, Jason Hickey's Introduction to Objective Caml says: we need to define a polymorphic type of sets a set abstractly. That is, in the interface we will declare a type a set without giving a definition, preventing other parts of the program from knowing, or depending on, the particular representation of sets we have chosen. From the above statements, I guess it means in interface definition, we should hide the implementation details. But what details has been hidden? type 'a set = 'a list In the implementation file, it says type 'a set = 'a list. What does this do then? Does it mean this set only takes a list? If it does mean this, will it be necessary to tell this in the interface file, since user of this set should know it takes only list, right?

@TITLE:Python Scikit Random Forest Regressor Error
@CONTENT:I am trying to load training and test data from a csv, run the random forest regressor in scikit/sklearn, and then predict the output from the test file.

@LINK:/questions/14231322/simulating-cpu-load-in-c
@TITLE:Simulating CPU Load In C++
@CONTENT:I am currently writing an application in Windows using C++ and I would like to simulate CPU load. I have the following code: void task1(void *param) { 

unsigned elapsed =0;
unsigned t0;

while(1){

    if ((t0=clock())>=50+elapsed){//if time elapsed is 50ms

        elapsed=t0;
        Sleep(50);
    }
  }
}

int main(){

int ThreadNr;

for(int i=0; i < 4;i++){//for each core (i.e. 4 cores)
    _beginthread( task1, 0, &ThreadNr );//create a new thread and run the "task1" function
}

while(1){}
}
 I wrote this code using the same methodology as in the answers given in this thread: Simulate steady CPU load and spikes My questions are: Have I translated the C# code from the other post correctly over to C++? Will this code generate an average CPU load of 50% on a quad-core processor? How can I, within reasonable accuracy, find out the load percentage of the CPU? (is task manager my only option?) EDIT: The reason I ask this question is that I want to eventually be able to generate CPU loads of 10,20,30,...,90% within a reasonable tolerance. This code seems to work well for to generate loads 70%< but seems to be very inaccurate at any load below 70% (as measured by the task manager CPU load readings). Would anyone have any ideas as to how I could generate said loads but still be able to use my program on different computers (i.e. with different CPUs)?

@TITLE:How to attach a password encoder to a User Interface in Silex?
@CONTENT:So I am trying to create a new Silex application and use the Security bundle included. For simplicities sake I was going to go with the basic password encoding. Per the Silex documentation http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/security.html I have created a custom User Provider. However this user interface does not seem to use the default password encoding. I can successfully get a password out of $password = $app['security.encoder.digest']->encodePassword('foo');
 However when I use the example // find the encoder for a UserInterface instance
$encoder = $app['security.encoder_factory']->getEncoder($user);

// compute the encoded password for foo
$password = $encoder->encodePassword('foo', $user->getSalt());
 I get the RuntimeException: No encoder has been configured for account In symfony2, I would use something like the following encoders:
        somename:
            class: Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User
        Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User: sha512
        Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User: plaintext
        Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User:
            algorithm: sha512
            encode_as_base64: true
            iterations: 5000
        Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User:
            id: my.custom.encoder.service.id
 But that doesnt seem to be the case here. I can't seem to find any type of setEncoder method so I am a bit stumped.
@CODE:$password = $app['security.encoder.digest']->encodePassword('foo'); // find the encoder for a UserInterface instance
$encoder = $app['security.encoder_factory']->getEncoder($user);

@TITLE:matlab javaaddpath not working anymore (with jar built with jdk 1.7)
@CONTENT:I'm using an external jar (developped by me) into my matlab projet (developped by me) with javaaddpath command. I have updated my programming environnement from Matlab r2011a to r2012b, jdk from 1.6.0_29 to 1.7.0_09 and windows from XP to Seven. Firstly I have not recompiled my jar file, and my whole project is still working (running without bug). But now, I'm trying to recompile my jar file. I had some problem with that, but it solved (see: javac @<opiton_file> and encoding). But now that my jar tool is rebuilt, I can't use it into matlab... Matlab display the error: Undefined variable "optimizer" or function "optimizer.Gui".
 where optimizer is a package (ie a directory inside the jar file, directory which contain a Gui class). To summarize, I'm using the code (the last line must popup a JFrame) : javaaddpath('the full path of my jar file.jar');
optimizer.Gui;
 Without updating the compiled version of the jar file, it's working. With the new version (same source code), matlab output the error. I have a Main class (containing a main function) at the root of the jar file and a manitifest specifying this Main class as the main class. This Main class make some test, to ensure all the functionnalities into the jar file is working. So I can run java -jar my_jar_file.jar and see that all test are OK (one of the test displayed my optimizer.Gui). Is there an incompatibility of the javac version and matlab? Of is it because I had some trouble with file encoding?...

 result: when I debug, the data parameter in UpdateStatusToDelete returns {string[0]} instead of data:a data:b data:c data:d What am I doing wrong? Any help is really appreciated.
@CODE:var list = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];

    var jsonText = { data: list };

    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "/api/scheduledItemPriceStatus/updateStatusToDelete",
        data: jsonText,
        dataType: "json",

 I inherited the code to unmarshall the files, and it returns a single java object. I now need to marshall the single java object back to two files. I realize there are other solutions (i.e. using two objects instead of one, which is an option) but I need to know if its possible to marshall a single object and maintain the xi:include (or reintroduce it) and export to two (or more) xml files. Is this even possible? If so any tips/ideas? Thanks Updates: I have been researching this (I researched prior to asking). I did find this tutorial http://tutorial.waycoolsearch.com/java/jaxb2.php which appeared to have my answer, but alas when I marshall the file it takes what was two and makes one.

@TITLE:Canvas animation stutters in FireFox but is perfect in Chrome
@CONTENT:I recently got about doing some HTML5/Canvas stuff and was going about my business quite happily, testing stuff in Chrome, until I decided to try what I have been working on in Firefox... doesn't work so good. This is a bare bones example of the kind of stuff I'm doing. Setting up the basic requestAnimationFrame shim, the main loop clears the canvas and then updates and draws my objects. Easy enough, examples about this stuff are every where to be found. function loop() {
  canvas.width = canvas.width;

  requestAnimFrame(loop);

  rR.update();
  rG.update();
  rB.update();
  rY.update();

  rR.draw();
  rG.draw(); 
  rB.draw();
  rY.draw();
}

function Rect(color, x, y, speedX, speedY) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
  this.color = color;
  this.speedX = speedX;
  this.speedY = speedY;
}

Rect.prototype.draw = function () {
  context.fillStyle = this.color;
  context.beginPath();
  context.rect(this.x, this.y, 10, 10);
  context.closePath();
  context.fill();
};

Rect.prototype.update = function () {
  if (this.x < 0 || this.x > canvas.width) this.speedX = -this.speedX;
  if (this.y < 0 || this.y > canvas.height) this.speedY = -this.speedY;

  this.x += this.speedX;

 http://jsfiddle.net/Polaris666/psDM9/3/ When I test that in Chrome it looks great, but Firefox has a lot of stuttering and tearing, for what seems a rather simple task. I have found similar questions but none with a good clear solution. Is this a Firefox thing? Are Webkit browsers just better at doing this? Should I just give up on it and hope it is fixed in future versions of the browser? Or maybe it is my particular set up? I'm using Windows 7 64bit with FireFox 17.0.1. Any help is appreciated.

@TITLE:sharedRepository wrong group
@CONTENT:I use a bare repository where multiple devs can push. As suggested, I used sharedRepository = true to tell git to give a group of users the permission to push. When I want to add pushers, I simply add them the required group as secondary group (sudo adduser the_pusher the_required_group) When devs push, I see the files created in objects directory created with the good permission but not the good group. Example: $ ls -l repository/objects
...
drwxrwsr-x 2 pusher1 pusher1 4096 janv.  7 14:13 fa
drwxrwsr-x 2 pusher1 pusher1 4096 d?c.  26 15:29 fc
drwxrwsr-x 2 pusher1 pusher1 4096 d?c.  11 12:41 fd
...
 As you can see, the attached group is the primary group of pusher1 How can I make git to attach these objects to the_required_group instead ? Update I use git over ssh. Each dev have his own ssh account.
@CODE:sharedRepository = true sudo adduser the_pusher the_required_group objects $ ls -l repository/objects

 I believe object o = new Object(); should be outside the method as a Field. Since each thread is getting a new instance of o , there will be multiple locks. Is there anything I'm missing here? cause I know it should lock on fields(in this specific case).

@CONTENT:i'm having some problems with entity framework and a sql database. so my problem is this: in my database there are two tables that have the same property, they are identical in type and length but they are not related in any way. no foreign key whatsoever. as soon as i start to interact with the database entity framework spits out the famous error: error 0019: Each property name in a type must be unique. Property name was already defined. i'm using the code first approach by the way. this is one of the class representations of the tables: [Table("bo")]
public class TbPBO
{
   [Required(AllowEmptyStrings = false, ErrorMessage = "O campo de nome nao pode ser nulo")]
    [MaxLength(55, ErrorMessage = "O campo de nome nao pode ter mais que 55 caracteres")]
    [Column("nome", TypeName = "char", Order = 4)]
    public string TbBonome { get; set; }
 }
 this is the other class representation of the table: [Table("bi")]
public class TbPBi
{
    [Required(AllowEmptyStrings = false, ErrorMessage = "O campo nome nao pode ser nulo")]
    [MaxLength(55, ErrorMessage = "O campo nome nao pode ter mais que 55 caracteres")]
    [Column("nome", TypeName = "char", Order = 62)]
    public string TbBinome { get; set; }
}
 i've tried modifying my context by using this but without any luck. public class PHCDbContext:DbContext
{
     public PHCDbContext(string connection):base(connection)
     {

        Database.SetInitializer<PHCDbContext>(null);
     }
     protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
     {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
        modelBuilder.Entity<TbPBO>()

        modelBuilder.Entity<TbPBi>()
            .Map(mbo => { mbo.Properties(tnome => new { tnome.TbBinome }); mbo.ToTable("bi"); });

    }
}
 any idea on how to work around this? one more thing. the database must not be changed in any way. i cannot modify it. help would be appreciated. thanks in advance

@TITLE:No periods at beginning or end of expression?
@CONTENT:I want to allow alphanumeric characters and periods; however, the phrase cannot contain more two or more periods in a row, it cannot start or end with a period, and spaces are not allowed. I am using both PHP and Javascript. So far, I have /^(?!.*\.{2})[a-zA-Z0-9.]+$/ This works for allowing alphanumeric characters and periods, while denying spaces and consecutive periods, but I still am not sure how to check for starting and/or ending periods. How might I do this? and, is there an even better way to do what I already have?

@LINK:/questions/14134004/node-js-and-new-when-using-require
@TITLE:Node js and new when using require
@CONTENT:I've been trying to sort out the include of other js files within node.js. I've read all about the require function and other alternatives and decided to go with the require function (as the code will only ever be used on node.js, not in a browser). In my code I'm using prototypes to create an 'object' which I later wish to create an instance off. To get it to work I've been writing code like the following (lets call it vehicle.js): var util = require('util');
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

module.exports = Vehicle;

util.inherits(Vehicle, EventEmitter);

function Vehicle(options) {
    EventEmitter.call(this);
    options = options || {};
    ...
}

Vehicle.prototype._doStartEvent = function(data) {
    this.emit('start', data);
};

Vehicle.prototype.testRun = function() {
    this._doStartEvent();
};
 Then in my main js (lets call it server.js), I have the following: var test = exports;
exports.Vehicle = require('./vehicle.js');

var remoteVehicle = new test.Vehicle({address: "192.168.1.3"});

remoteVehicle.on('start', function(d) {console.log('started');});

remoteVehicle.testRun();
 Now this all works fine, but I do not have a good understanding of what is going on. My main concern is the use of var test = exports; and then exports.Vehicle = require(...). I tried just doing something like var vehicle = require(...).Vehicle and var vehicle = require(...), with the goal of just using new Vehicle or similar, but I couldn't get it to work. Am I forced to use exports and if so why? Please note I've been using the AR Drone project as an example, the above code is based on how they have done their modules internally. Refer to Client.js and index.js.
@CODE:var util = require('util');
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

module.exports = Vehicle;

util.inherits(Vehicle, EventEmitter);

function Vehicle(options) {
    EventEmitter.call(this);
    options = options || {};
    ...
}

Vehicle.prototype._doStartEvent = function(data) {
    this.emit('start', data);
};

Vehicle.prototype.testRun = function() {
    this._doStartEvent();
}; var test = exports;
exports.Vehicle = require('./vehicle.js');

var remoteVehicle = new test.Vehicle({address: "192.168.1.3"});

remoteVehicle.on('start', function(d) {console.log('started');});

remoteVehicle.testRun(); var test = exports; exports.Vehicle = require(...) var vehicle = require(...).Vehicle var vehicle = require(...) new Vehicle

    } else {
      // The file doesn't have any content stored on Drive.
      return null;
    }
  }
 When I ran the script it shows file.getDownloadUrl() is NULL. What did I miss here? Now it's executing after adding the following line before I call the download function File file1 = service.files().get(fileid).execute();
downloadFile(service,file1);
 Now the problem is how to download the file with the help of 'response' which I got from the script....
@CODE:private static InputStream downloadFile(Drive service, File file) {
    if (file.getDownloadUrl() != null && file.getDownloadUrl().length() > 0) {
      try {
        HttpResponse resp =
            service.getRequestFactory().buildGetRequest(new GenericUrl(file.getDownloadUrl()))
                .execute();
        return resp.getContent();
      } catch (IOException e) {
        // An error occurred.
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
      }
    } else {
      // The file doesn't have any content stored on Drive.
      return null;
    }
  } file.getDownloadUrl() File file1 = service.files().get(fileid).execute();
downloadFile(service,file1);

@TITLE:Is there any way to control AutoDetectChanges on SqlEntityConnection?
@CONTENT:This article provides some evidence that turning off AutoDetectChanges on your Entity Framework data context can provide a significant performance improvement when inserting large numbers of entities. context.Configuration.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;
 However, the DataContext provided by the SqlEntityConnection type provider doesn't seem to provide any way to control this setting. There's no context.Configuration property, or context.DataContext.Configuration property. There is a context.DataContext.ContextOptions but it has nothing even resembling AutoDetectChangesEnabled. The DataContext property on the type provider context is of type System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext. Does anyone know of a way to influence this particular setting from there?

@CONTENT:I have a container that has 2 divs within it: span9 and span3. Inside my span9 div, I would expect to be limited to only 9 columns. However, unless I set the div within the span9 to be a span12, it leaves 3 extra blank columns! Why on earth would this happen? To me, "span9" should mean that I have 9 columns available. I don't see anything at all that I am using that would cause that content to be allowed to reset to 12 columns in the grid. Makes zero sense.

 Upon investigating further (in MSDN, SO and other places) it appears as if .net 2.0 does not support sending a DataTable to the database (missing things such as SqlParameter.TypeName), but I'm still not sure since I haven't seen anyone explicitly claiming that this feature is not available in .net 2.0 Is this true? If so, is there another way to send a collection of data to the database? Thanks in advance!

I am pasting all the code I wrote here any help would be greatly appreciated and would help me to learn. THANKS A LOT! HTML     <ul class="testimonial-text">

 I am using the card GTX 560 ti having a compute capability greater than 2.0 and when I have searched a bit about the printing from cuda kernels I also saw that I need to change the compiler from sm_10 to sm_2.0 to take the full advantage of the card. Also some suggested for cuPrintf to serve the purpose. I am bit confused what should I do and what should be the simplest and quickest way to get the printouts on my console screen. If I need to change the nvcc compiler from 1.0 to 2.0 then what should I do? One more thing I would like to mention that I am using windows 7.0 and programming in visual studio 2010. Thanks for all your help.

@TITLE:do any mongodb ORMs allow you to alias fields?
@CONTENT:I just watched this: http://blog.mongodb.org/post/38467892360/mongodb-schema-design-insights-and-tradeoffs-from One suggestion that came out of the talk: in docs that will be replicated many times, try to make the field names as small as possible: Reduce collection size by always using short field names as a convention. This will help you save memory over time. Choose "u" over "publicationUrl". Makes sense if you're talking about millions of rows. However, big readability problem there. It might be obvious that the value is a url, but what sort of url is it? This might be solvable in the ORM though. Do any ORMs that interface with MongoDb allow you to say that 'u' in the db would map to 'publicationUrl' in the code? When you have things like a.u in code, that's pretty poor readability; article.u isn't much better. (Ruby and node.js tags are there because those are the languages that I work with mongo in. Feel free to add tags.)

 Why does adding deriving Show to the Person entity generate the derivation of all three typeclasses (Show, Read, Eq)? I'm very new to Haskell and Yesod, so I apologize if it's obvious, but I can't find the answer anywhere! Is it just an error in the documentation? Thanks!

@TITLE:Does an async void method create a new thread everytime it is called?
@CONTENT:I have the following scenario: async void DoStuff() {
    // ...
}

button1.Click += (s, p) => {
    DoStuff();
};
 I'm not sure what happens when I call an async void method while the first call is still incomplete. Will the call create a new thread everytime it is called or will the call destroy and override the previous thread created? Also, will the local method variables be shared if the former assumption is right? EDITED: I had misunderstood the async await thing because in windows 8 apps, it behaves differently. If you thought that calling an async method was the same as creating a new thread like me, please read this clarifying aricle.

@TITLE:Count the number of occurrences of a number in a sorted array
@CONTENT:My teacher gave me the next task: On a sorted array, find the number of occurrences of a number.
The complexity of the algorithm must be as small as possible.
 This is what I have thought of: public static int count(int[] a, int x)
{
    int low = 0, high = a.length - 1;

    while( low <= high )
    {
        int middle = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if( a[middle] > x ) {
            // Continue searching the lower part of the array
            high = middle - 1;
        } else if( a[middle] < x ) {
            // Continue searching the upper part of the array
            low = middle + 1;
        } else {
            // We've found the array index of the value
            return x + SearchLeft(arr, x, middle) + SearchRight(arr, x, middle);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
 SearchLeft and SearchRight iterate the array, until the number doesn't show. I'm not sure if I have achieved writing the faster code for this problem, and I would like see other opinions. Edit: After some help from comments and answers, this is my current attempt: public static int count(int[] array, int value)

    return SearchRightBound(array, value) - SearchLeftBound(array, value);

@TITLE:Effect of using Non Page-Locked memory for asynchronous memory copy?
@CONTENT:In CUDA C Best Practices Guide Version 5.0, Section 6.1.2, it is written that: In contrast with cudaMemcpy(), the asynchronous transfer version requires pinned host memory (see Pinned Memory), and it contains an additional argument, a stream ID. It means the cudaMemcpyAsync function should fail if I use simple memory. But this is not what happened. Just for testing purpose, I tried the following program: Kernel: __global__ void kernel_increment(float* src, float* dst, int n)
{
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if(tid<n)   
        dst[tid] = src[tid] + 1.0f;
}
 Main: int main()
{
    float *hPtr1, *hPtr2, *dPtr1, *dPtr2;

    const int n = 1000;

    size_t bytes = n * sizeof(float);

    cudaStream_t str1, str2;

    hPtr1 = new float[n];
    hPtr2 = new float[n];

    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        hPtr1[i] = static_cast<float>(i);

    cudaMalloc<float>(&dPtr1,bytes);
    cudaMalloc<float>(&dPtr2,bytes);

    dim3 block(16);
    dim3 grid((n + block.x - 1)/block.x);

    cudaStreamCreate(&str1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&str2);

    cudaMemcpyAsync(dPtr1,hPtr1,bytes,cudaMemcpyHostToDevice,str1);
    kernel_increment<<<grid,block,0,str2>>>(dPtr1,dPtr2,n);
    cudaMemcpyAsync(hPtr2,dPtr2,bytes,cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost,str1);

    printf("Status: %s\n",cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));

    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    printf("Status: %s\n",cudaGetErrorString(cudaGetLastError()));

    cudaStreamDestroy(str1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(str2);

    cudaFree(dPtr1);
    cudaFree(dPtr2);

    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        std::cout<<hPtr2[i]<<std::endl;

    delete[] hPtr1;
    delete[] hPtr2;

    return 0;
}
 The program gave correct output. The array incremented successfully. How did cudaMemcpyAsync execute without page locked memory? Am I missing something here?

@TITLE:Is there any reason why the stream cout has the flag std::ios_base::skipws set?
@CONTENT:cout has the flags std::ios_base::skipws and std::ios_base::dec set by default You can verify this with the code: #include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    ios_base::fmtflags flags = cout.flags();
    string sflags;

    if( flags & ios_base::skipws ) sflags += "skipws";

    if( flags & ios_base::showbase ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "showbase" : " showbase";
    if( flags & ios_base::showpoint ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "showpoint" : " showpoint";
    if( flags & ios_base::showpos ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "showpos" : " showpos";
    if( flags & ios_base::left ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "left" : " left";
    if( flags & ios_base::right ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "right" : " right";
    if( flags & ios_base::internal ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "internal" : " internal";

    if( flags & ios_base::_Stdio ) sflags += sflags.empty() ? "_Stdio" : " _Stdio";

@TITLE:What's the safest way to define short function name aliases in C++?
@CONTENT:Suppose I have a class Utility in a file utility.h: class Utility {
public:
    static double longDescriptiveName(double x) { return x + 42; }
};
 And then I find that I use the function longDescriptiveName(...) a LOT. So like an irresponsible C++ programmer that I am when I've had too much coffee, I create a new file utilitymacros.h and add the following there: #define ldn Utility::longDescriptiveName
 Now I include "utilitymacros.h" in any *.cpp where I use ldn(...) and my heart is filled with joy over how much more convinient it is to type 3 letters vs 28. Question: Is there a safer (more proper) way of doing this than with #define? I've noticed that I have to include "utilitymacros.h" after including boost headers, which I obviously don't like because it's a sign of clashes (though the Boost errors I get are not very clear as to what the clash is). Clarification 1: On Code Readability In case you might say that this negatively affects code readability, I assure you it does not, because it's a small set of functions that are used A LOT. An example that is widely know is stoi for stringToInteger. Another is pdf for probabilityDensityFunction, etc. So if I want to do the following, stoi is more readable in my opinion: int x = stoi(a) + stoi(b) + stoi(c) + stoi(d);
 Than: int x = Utility::stringToInteger(a) + Utility::stringToInteger(b)
        + Utility::stringToInteger(c) + Utility::stringToInteger(d);
 Or: int x = Utility::stringToInteger(a);
x += Utility::stringToInteger(b);
x += Utility::stringToInteger(c);

 Clarification 2: Editor Macro I use Emacs as my IDE of choice and a Kinesis keyboard so you KNOW I use a ton of keyboard macros, custom keyboard shortcuts, as well as actually modifying what I see in the editor vs what's actually stored in the h/cpp file. But still, I feel like the simplicity and visual readability (as argued above) of using a function abbreviation in a few select cases really is the result I'm looking for (this is certainly subject to a degree).

@TITLE:rspec view stubs and partials
@CONTENT:I'm testing a view with RSpec (2.12 on Rails 3.2.8). I'm using CanCan to conditionally display certain elements on a page. This requires a controller method 'current_user'. In some of my specs I've been able to stub out current_user, eg. controller.stub(:current_user).and_return(etc) or view.stub.etc . This works for some of my specs. But I've got a couple where it's not working and I don't understand why. The two specs where it's not working test a view, which calls down into a partial, and inside the partial I access 'current_user' as a method. The error is undefined local variable or method `current_user' 
 So I guess my question is how to stub methods correctly so that they can be accessed down inside partials. How should it be done?

@CONTENT:I retrieve date and time strings from xml by parsing XElement. The date and time values are retrieved by file.Element("Date").Value and file.Element("Time").Value respectively. After I retrieve the Date value I parse it to a DateTime variable DateTime dt,ts;
dt = file.Element("Date").Value; // the value is say 12/29/2012
 and then this dt value is set to a datepicker value on the xaml UI datepicker.Value = dt;
 I also have a timepicker whose value have to be set by the Time value retrieved from xml. To set the timepicker value I do the following. declare 3 strings, say: string a = file.Element("Time").Value; // the value is say 9:55 AM
string b = file.Element("Time").Value.Substring(0, 5) + ":00"; // eg 9:55:00
string c = file.Element("Time").Value.Substring(5); // the value is ' AM'
 I then concatenate the Date Value and string 'b' and 'c' string total = file.Element("Date").Value + " " + b + c;
 the value of total is now '12/29/2012 9:55:00 AM' I then try to Parse this total string to a DateTime, but it throws a formatexception DateTime.Parse("total, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture");
 Any help appreciated...

I have some sample code, but looks like I need another UUID of a different device.It looks like this: private static final UUID MY_UUID = UUID
                .fromString("00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB");
 Later on in the code, it uses this UUID to make a connection: tmp = device.createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(MY_UUID);
 I have done some research online, like [here][1]. I think I need a different UUID number for the new device I'm working on. How do I get the UUID number? On the device, there are two lines of number saying: SN: 1201L0023 BT: 10:00:E8:C5:16:85 Thanks in advance! Jake

@LINK:/questions/14070346/user-session-id-as-a-parameter-in-an-ajax-call
@TITLE:User Session ID as a Parameter in an Ajax Call
@CONTENT:I have created an HttpHandler that I will be using with a jquery-Ajax call. This HttpHandler will access the database and check something related to the currently singed in user. The user is considered signed in by using the Session, with an attribute called user_id. Session["user_id"] = userId;
 I tried to retrieve this Session in the HttpHandler but that doesn't seem to work. So I thought about sending the user_id as a parameter.     var user_id = //Retrieved in some way...
    $.ajax({
        url: 'QuestionRate.ashx?id=user_id',
        success: function (msg, status, xhr) {

        },
        error: function () {
            alert(msg);
        }
    });
 But this really seems like a bad idea, anyone who will read the codes can simply access the Handler with the id that he wants. So what can I do in this situation? I want the Handler to get the user_id for database access, yet I wanna make sure that this user_id is the actual id of the signed in user. There's no way to access the Session in the Handler?

fields.put("z", "value z");
String[] candidates = "a|b|c|d".split("|");

@TITLE:How to override a previously set jquery event handler?
@CONTENT:In my code, an event handler for an element is set which changes that element's css height to 100px. At somewhere else, I want a different event handler to be run if certain conditions meet, which should override the previous event handler and change its height to 200px. Is there a way to do that, or to clear all previously set event handlers for an element?

@TITLE:ckeditor getData() doesnt seem to work as it should
@CONTENT:First off I'll start off by saying I am new to javascript so hopefully this isn't a complete face palm question. That being said, the following code should alert the value of the editor when the user clicks off of it. <script type='text/javascript'>
function openEditor(){
html = "Hello World";
config = {
startupFocus : true
};
editor = CKEDITOR.appendTo( 'textBox', config, html );


 if (editor) {
    editor.on('blur', function(event) {
        var ckvalue = CKEDITOR.instances.editor.getData();
        alert(ckvalue);
    });
 }
}
</script>
<html>
<a href='#' onclick='openEditor()'>Open Editor</a><br />
<div id='textBox'></div>
</html>
 Instead google chrome console reports: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getData' of undefined " Now when I change var ckvalue = CKEDITOR.instances.editor.getData();
 to var ckvalue = CKEDITOR.instances.editor1.getData();
 It works. This baffles me because I never declared a editor1 instance. I was hoping someone with a little more experience could explain to me why editor1 works when editor doesnt. Here is a working example of what Im talking about: http://jsfiddle.net/s3aDC/6/

config = {

@TITLE:Conditional formatting of panel background in GGplot2
@CONTENT:I was wondering whether there is a "direct" manner to link the slope of a regression line in a ggplot facet panel to the background colour of that panel (i.e. to visually seperate positive slopes from negative slopes in a large grid). I understand how to add a regression line in GGplots - as was well explained on Adding a regression line to a facet_grid with qplot in R I also understand how to change the background if you have previously added this information to the original dataframe - as explained on Conditionally change panel background with facet_grid? However - is there a way to do this "in the geom_rect" formula without having to e.g. run the regression seperately, bind them to the original dataframe, and then use this as a variable for geom_rect()? is there a way for geom_rect() to use the information from stat_smooth()?

@CONTENT:I have a server with lots of media drives ~43TB. An areca 1882ix-16 is set to spin the drives down after 30 minutes of inactivity since most days an individual drive is not even used. This works nicely to prevent unnecessary power and heat. In this case the drives still show up in windows explorer but when you click to access them it takes about 10 seconds for the folder list to show up since it has to wait for the drive to spin up. For administrative work I have a need to spin up all the drives to be able to search among them. Clicking on each drive in windows explorer and then waiting for it to spin up before clicking the next drive is very tedious. Obviously multiple explorer windows makes it faster but it is still tedious. I thought a powershell script may ease the pain. So I started with the following: $mediaDrives = @('E:', 'F:', 'G:', 'H:', 'I:', 'J:', 'K:', 'L:',
    'M:','N:', 'O:', 'P:', 'Q:', 'R:', 'S:')
get-childitem $mediaDrives  | foreach-object -process { $_.Name }
 This is just requesting that each drive in the array have its root folder name listed. That works to wake the drive but it is again a linear function. The script pauses for each drive before printing. Looking for a solution as to how to wake each drive simultaneously. Is there a way to multi-thread or something else?

 The output is what I expect, 01234 without the \n's, but the timing is unexpected. Rather than displaying each digit after a one-second pause, the process waits four seconds, then displays all five numbers. Why does print('string') behave differently from print('string', end='') in while-loops? Is there any way to display the characters without newlines, one second at a time?

@TITLE:Deserialize a Dynamic JSON Array on C# WebForm
@CONTENT:Hi I am generating a JSON on my API that I am trying to use on codebehind C# in my web application but I cannot deserialize well. My JSON has an object with JSON arrays and the element inside the array are dynamic so I cannot create a fixed class with those items becuase my JSON can have N ITEMS. {
    "MAINOBJET": [{
        "ITEM1": "23800",
        "ITEM2": "Dahl; Police",
        "ITEM3": "test@test.net"
    },
    {
        "ITEM1": "23802",
        "ITEM2": "Steve ; Police",
        "ITEM3": "test2@test.net"
    }]
}
 So how can I deserialize it to a DataTable, list or a Dictionary? Thank you
@CODE:{
    "MAINOBJET": [{
        "ITEM1": "23800",
        "ITEM2": "Dahl; Police",
        "ITEM3": "test@test.net"
    },
    {
        "ITEM1": "23802",
        "ITEM2": "Steve ; Police",
        "ITEM3": "test2@test.net"
    }]

 when i tried it in my machine i used to register the dll using regasm /codebase "dll path" and it worked fine. The problem when i tried to run in another machine, i followed the coming steps : 1) I created setup project and added the dll file. 2) I created .inf file and tried two contents which are : [version]
signature="$CHICAGO$"
AdvancedINF=2.0
[Add.Code]
ActiveX.dll=ActiveX.dll

[ActiveX.dll]
file-win32-x86=thiscab

 RegisterServer=yes [version]
signature="$CHICAGO$"
AdvancedINF=2.0

[Setup Hooks]
install=install

[install]
run=msiexec.exe /package """%EXTRACT_DIR%\DemoActiveXSetup.msi""" /qn
 3) I created .CAB file which contains the .inf and setup.exe files 4) Changed the object in HTML page to be : <OBJECT id="DemoActiveX" classid="clsid:400DCE17-4B26-4E59-9A88-AF39E2BE4A55" 
codebase="ActiveXCAB.CAB" ></OBJECT>  
 when i tried to open the page on the other machine a request windows opened which request to open CAB ,when i press yes nothing happened !!!!! why it doesn't open the setup.exe or msi file ?? BTW when i installed manually the setup file the activeX worked !

@TITLE:What does it mean to say that the source code is always available to interpreters?
@CONTENT:From Thinking in C++ - Vol. 1: Interpreters have many advantages. The transition from writing code to executing code is almost immediate, and the source code is always available so the interpreter can be much more specific when an error occurs. What does the bold line mean? Does it mean that the interpreter cannot work unless whole of the program is in memory? Which means we cannot divide the program into modules and then have the modules interpreted as and when needed (like we do with compilers)? If yes, then what's the reason behind this? UPDATE: From Thinking in C++ - Vol. 1: Most interpreters require that the complete source code be brought into the interpreter all at once. So, does this now indicate what I wrote above?

@TITLE:BigEndian, LittleEndian Confusion In Xuggler
@CONTENT:Previously I posed a question about converting a byte[] to short[] and a new problem I encountered is converting/ not converting the data from byte[] to BigEndian. Here is what is going on: I am using TargetDataLine to read data into a byte[10000]. The AudioFormat object has BigEndian set to true, arbitrarily. This byte[] needs to be converted to short[] so that it can be encoded using Xuggler I don't know whether the AudioFormat BigEndian should be set to true or false. I have tried both the cases and I get an Exception in both the cases. To convert byte[] to short[], I do this: fromMic.read(tempBufferByte, 0, tempBufferByte.length);
for(int i=0;i<tempBufferShort.length;i++){
tempBufferShort[i] = (short) tempBufferByte[i];
}  
 where: fromMic is TargetDataLine tempBufferbyte is byte[10000] tempBufferShort is short[10000] I get the Exception:    java.lang.RuntimeException: failed to write packet: com.xuggle.xuggler.IPacket@90098448[complete:true;dts:12;pts:12;size:72;key:true;flags:1;stream index:1;duration:1;position:-1;time base:9/125;]
 Miscellaneous information that may be needed: How I set the stream for adding audio in Xuggler: writer.addAudioStream(0,1,fmt.getChannels(),(int)fmt.getSampleRate());
 How I perform the encoding writer.encodeAudio(1,tempBufferShort,timeStamp,TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);
 Java Doc on AudioFormat ...In addition to the encoding, the audio format includes other properties that further specify the exact arrangement of the data. These include the number of channels, sample rate, sample size, byte order, frame rate, and frame size... and For 16-bit samples (or any other sample size larger than a byte), byte order is important; the bytes in each sample are arranged in either the "little-endian" or "big-endian" style. Questions: Do I need to keep the BigEndian as true in javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat object? What is causing the error? Is it the format? I guess I get BigEndian data preformatted by the AudioFormat object.

@CONTENT:As I understand, the Bounded Context can have modules, the modules can have many aggregate roots, the aggregate root can have entities. For the persistence, each aggregate root should have a repository. With the numerous aggregate roots in a large project, is it okay to use a Generic Repository, one for ready only and one for update? Or should have separate repository for each aggregate root which can provide better control.

@TITLE:Models and roles in Qt5 and Qt 4.8
@CONTENT:Today I wanted to play with QtQuick2 a little bit. So I have started to port very simple Qt Quick1 app to Quick2. This app uses some models. And in Qt5 models are not working as I expect: I can't access data using roles. This is my QML code: import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
width: 800
height: 360

ListView {
    model: mainModel
    spacing: 5
    anchors.fill: parent
    orientation: ListView.Vertical
    delegate: Text {
        text: "1"

        Component.onCompleted: {
            console.log(mainModel);
            console.log(mainModel.roles() );
            console.log(model);
            console.log(model.homm); // `homm` is my roleName
            console.log(homm);
        }
    }
 In Qt4.8 I was able to get data using roleName syntax (in this QML my roleName=homm) but in Qt5 I can't. That's what is written in console: MainModel(0x7fff08beff80)
homm,wtf

 As you can see accessing data using roles work as expected. I have created test apps for you: for Qt5 and for Qt 4.8. I hope you will help me to find the heart of matter. P.S. I have made some changes in Qt5 version. In Qt5 method setRoleNames() is obsolete and overriding of roleNames() is recommended. I have done this overriding. P.P.S. My code example should be compilable on GNU/Linux x64

The newly added column is not visible when I browse the table data, but it is when I see the table structure. Why can't I see it in the table data? I am using the portable package of xampp. Also, queries regarding to that column are running fine.

@TITLE:Javascript: execCommand(removeformat) doesn't strip h2 tag
@CONTENT:I'm tweaking a wysiwyg editor, and I'm trying to create an icon which will strip selected text of h2. In a previous version, the following command worked perfectly: oRTE.document.execCommand("removeformat", false, "");
 But in the current version, although that command successfully removes from selected text such tags as bold, underline, italics, it leaves the h2 tag intact. (Interestingly enough, execCommand("formatblock"...) successfully creates the h2 tag.) I'm thinking that I'm going to have to abandon execCommand and find another way, but I'm also thinking that it will be a lot more than just 1 line of code! Would be grateful for suggestions.

@TITLE:Periodic JavaFX Service
@CONTENT:I am wanting to execute a task at a regular interval from my JavaFX application. The task pulls data from a remote stream. While I know I could use a Timer as suggested below: JavaFX periodic background task I believe this should be able to be done using the JavaFX Service object. There's mention in the Javadoc about specifying a custom executor (ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor comes to mind here), but how would one specify the period and delay? Ideally, this would use the Service's usual start, reset, restart, and state bindings... public class MyFirstLineService extends Service<String> {
     private StringProperty url = new SimpleStringProperty(this, "url");
     public final void setUrl(String value) { url.set(value); }
     public final String getUrl() { return url.get(); }
     public final StringProperty urlProperty() { return url; }

     public MyFirstLineService() {
         setExecutor(new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor());
     }

     protected Task createTask() {
         final String _url = getUrl();
         return new Task<String>() {
             protected String call() throws Exception {
                 URL u = new URL(_url);

@TITLE:Organizing a large python script
@CONTENT:I've been working on a general utility script for a while now that basically just accepts user input to preform some task like opening a program. In this program, I define a name "command" as a raw_input and then use if statements to check the list for a command (small example below). Constantly using if statements is making the program run slowly and so I'm wondering if there is a better way such as maybe a table of commands? I'm pretty new to programming so not sure how to accomplish this. import os

@TITLE:Create transform to map from one rectangle to another?
@CONTENT:What is the simplest way to create AffineTransform which maps coordinates from one rectangle to another (float/double rectangles are given)? UPDATE 1 Rectangles can be absolutely different. For example [(0,0)-(1,1)] and [(150,-14)-(-1000,-14.1)]. And transformation should transform uniformly. For example, rectangle corners should be transformed one to one. For example coordinates (0,0) should turn to (150,-14). UPDATE 2 I need AffineTransform object, not just calculation. Because I want to apply it to Graphics object.

What's the difference and why is my program hanging? void HandleTCPClient(int clntSocket)

 thanks!! EDIT: so if i make the line "while((q=fread(reader, 1, 1, request))>0) {" i get "i read something" all over my screen... not sure what this means. So is it correct that fread will literally do nothing if there isn't at least your buffer's size number of characters present in the stream?

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Determine if a String is an Integer in Java I have found several links related to my question, but they were not exactly what I was looking for. I would prefer to use a simple boolean than to learn to use the try/catch thing. Anyways, here is my question: I want to set a boolean to true or false depending on if a string is an integer >= 10 and <= 100. So my objective is to set the boolean "answer": String junk;
if (junk is an integer between 10 and 100){
return true;}
else{
return false;}
 if junk = 50, its true.
if junk = fifty, its false.
if junk = 50:-p, its false.
if junk = 5, its false.
if junk = 500, its false.
 Thanks!
@CODE:String junk;
if (junk is an integer between 10 and 100){
return true;}
else{
return false;} if junk = 50, its true.
if junk = fifty, its false.
if junk = 50:-p, its false.
if junk = 5, its false.

@TITLE:Why do python print statements that contain 'end=' arguments behave differently in while-loops?
@CONTENT:I'm running python version 2.7.3 on MacOSX. Consider this block of code: from __future__ import print_function
import time
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
    time.sleep(1)
 If I run this script, I observe the output I expect: The numbers 0 through 4 with a \n character appended to each number. Futhermore, each number displays after a one second pause. 0
1
2
3
4
 Now consider this code block: from __future__ import print_function
import time
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x, end='')
    x += 1
    time.sleep(1)
 The output is what I expect, 01234 without the \n's, but the timing is unexpected. Rather than displaying each digit after a one-second pause, the process waits four seconds, then displays all five numbers. Why does print('string') behave differently from print('string', end='') in while-loops? Is there any way to display the characters without newlines, one second at a time? I tried sys.stdout.write(str(x)), but it behaves the same way as print(end='').
@CODE:from __future__ import print_function
import time
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
    time.sleep(1) 0 4 \n 0
1
2
3
4 from __future__ import print_function
import time
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x, end='')
    x += 1
    time.sleep(1) 01234 \n print('string') print('string', end='') sys.stdout.write(str(x)) print(end='')

@TITLE:Dynamically load jQuery in IE and Chrome
@CONTENT:I'm creating an external widget that uses jQuery and rather than have the user include it separately I'd like to check to see if it's loaded and load it dynamically if it's not. Problem is I need to wait until it's loaded to execute the rest of the script, which requires event handlers that IE and FF/Chrome handle differently. If I do this, it works fine in IE8: <div id="test">
<p>This is a test.</p>
</div>

<script>
if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') {
    s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js";
    if (s.addEventListener) {
        s.addEventListener("load", runScript, false);
    } else if (s.readyState) {
        s.onreadystatechange = runScript;
    }

} else {
    runScript();
}

function runScript() {
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);
    $('#test').css('font-size', '50px');

}
</script>
 But that doesn't work in Chrome. However if I append the script earlier, it works in Chrome but not IE: <div id="test">
<p>This is a test.</p>
</div>

<script>
if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') {
    s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js";
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);
    if (s.addEventListener) {
        s.addEventListener("load", runScript, false);
    } else if (s.readyState) {
        s.onreadystatechange = runScript;
    }

} else {
    runScript();
}

function runScript() {

    $('#test').css('font-size', '50px');

}
</script>
 Any ideas on how to dynamically load jQuery with event handlers that works both in IE and Chrome? EDIT: Changed appendChild target from test to head.
@CODE:<div id="test">
<p>This is a test.</p>
</div>

<script>

@TITLE:How to hide tabs on Powershell GUI?
@CONTENT:Ok, I created a powershell script and I am trying to make the main interface use a tabbed layout. I got all functionality i want working except i want to hide the tabs up top and use the buttons on the side to switch tabs. I already successfully have the buttons on the side selecting the different tabs, but i can't figure out how to hide the tabs up top? Anyone have any way how to do this???

@TITLE:What does it mean to say that the source code is always available to interpreters?
@CONTENT:From Thinking in C++ - Vol. 1: Interpreters have many advantages. The transition from writing code to executing code is almost immediate, and the source code is always available so the interpreter can be much more specific when an error occurs. What does the bold line mean? Does it mean that the interpreter cannot work unless whole of the program is in memory? Which means we cannot divide the program into modules and then have the modules interpreted as and when needed (like we do with compilers)? If yes, then what's the reason behind this? UPDATE: From Thinking in C++ - Vol. 1: Most interpreters require that the complete source code be brought into the interpreter all at once. So, does this now indicate what I wrote above?

@TITLE:BigEndian, LittleEndian Confusion In Xuggler
@CONTENT:Previously I posed a question about converting a byte[] to short[] and a new problem I encountered is converting/ not converting the data from byte[] to BigEndian. Here is what is going on: I am using TargetDataLine to read data into a byte[10000]. The AudioFormat object has BigEndian set to true, arbitrarily. This byte[] needs to be converted to short[] so that it can be encoded using Xuggler I don't know whether the AudioFormat BigEndian should be set to true or false. I have tried both the cases and I get an Exception in both the cases. To convert byte[] to short[], I do this: fromMic.read(tempBufferByte, 0, tempBufferByte.length);
for(int i=0;i<tempBufferShort.length;i++){
tempBufferShort[i] = (short) tempBufferByte[i];
}  
 where: fromMic is TargetDataLine tempBufferbyte is byte[10000] tempBufferShort is short[10000] I get the Exception:    java.lang.RuntimeException: failed to write packet: com.xuggle.xuggler.IPacket@90098448[complete:true;dts:12;pts:12;size:72;key:true;flags:1;stream index:1;duration:1;position:-1;time base:9/125;]
 Miscellaneous information that may be needed: How I set the stream for adding audio in Xuggler: writer.addAudioStream(0,1,fmt.getChannels(),(int)fmt.getSampleRate());
 How I perform the encoding writer.encodeAudio(1,tempBufferShort,timeStamp,TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);
 Java Doc on AudioFormat ...In addition to the encoding, the audio format includes other properties that further specify the exact arrangement of the data. These include the number of channels, sample rate, sample size, byte order, frame rate, and frame size... and For 16-bit samples (or any other sample size larger than a byte), byte order is important; the bytes in each sample are arranged in either the "little-endian" or "big-endian" style. Questions: Do I need to keep the BigEndian as true in javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat object? What is causing the error? Is it the format? I guess I get BigEndian data preformatted by the AudioFormat object.

@TITLE:Generic Vs Individual Repository for Aggregate Root
@CONTENT:As I understand, the Bounded Context can have modules, the modules can have many aggregate roots, the aggregate root can have entities. For the persistence, each aggregate root should have a repository. With the numerous aggregate roots in a large project, is it okay to use a Generic Repository, one for ready only and one for update? Or should have separate repository for each aggregate root which can provide better control.

@TITLE:Models and roles in Qt5 and Qt 4.8
@CONTENT:Today I wanted to play with QtQuick2 a little bit. So I have started to port very simple Qt Quick1 app to Quick2. This app uses some models. And in Qt5 models are not working as I expect: I can't access data using roles. This is my QML code: import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
width: 800
height: 360

ListView {
    model: mainModel
    spacing: 5
    anchors.fill: parent
    orientation: ListView.Vertical
    delegate: Text {
        text: "1"

        Component.onCompleted: {
            console.log(mainModel);
            console.log(mainModel.roles() );
            console.log(model);
            console.log(model.homm); // `homm` is my roleName
            console.log(homm);
        }
    }
 In Qt4.8 I was able to get data using roleName syntax (in this QML my roleName=homm) but in Qt5 I can't. That's what is written in console: MainModel(0x7fff08beff80)
homm,wtf
QQuickVDMAbstractItemModelData(0x23c96e0)
undefined
file:///media/disk/kakadu/prog/qt/quick2test/qml/quick2test/main.qml:20: ReferenceError: homm is not defined
 And that's for Quick 1.1 MainModel(0x7fffe58182f0)
undefined

 As you can see accessing data using roles work as expected. I have created test apps for you: for Qt5 and for Qt 4.8. I hope you will help me to find the heart of matter. P.S. I have made some changes in Qt5 version. In Qt5 method setRoleNames() is obsolete and overriding of roleNames() is recommended. I have done this overriding. P.P.S. My code example should be compilable on GNU/Linux x64

@CONTENT:I'm tweaking a wysiwyg editor, and I'm trying to create an icon which will strip selected text of h2. In a previous version, the following command worked perfectly: oRTE.document.execCommand("removeformat", false, "");
 But in the current version, although that command successfully removes from selected text such tags as bold, underline, italics, it leaves the h2 tag intact. (Interestingly enough, execCommand("formatblock"...) successfully creates the h2 tag.) I'm thinking that I'm going to have to abandon execCommand and find another way, but I'm also thinking that it will be a lot more than just 1 line of code! Would be grateful for suggestions.

For example [(0,0)-(1,1)] and [(150,-14)-(-1000,-14.1)]. And transformation should transform uniformly. For example, rectangle corners should be transformed one to one. For example coordinates (0,0) should turn to (150,-14). UPDATE 2 I need AffineTransform object, not just calculation. Because I want to apply it to Graphics object.

@TITLE:fread stalls on socket but fget doesnt?
@CONTENT:I'm working on a proxy server in c. I've gotten rather far using a combination of fread and fgets in different places but would like to reconcile and understand the difference. In the following example, I'm trying to use fread in a place i previously used fget successfully. Instead my server now hangs at the fread line. What's the difference and why is my program hanging? void HandleTCPClient(int clntSocket)
{
    FILE *request = fdopen(clntSocket, "r");
    char reader[2000];
    size_t q; //typo before
    while((q=fread(reader, 1, sizeof(reader), request))>0) {  //hangs here!
        printf("i read something!\n");
    }
    return;
}
 thanks!! EDIT: so if i make the line "while((q=fread(reader, 1, 1, request))>0) {" i get "i read something" all over my screen... not sure what this means. So is it correct that fread will literally do nothing if there isn't at least your buffer's size number of characters present in the stream?

@CONTENT:I wrote a Master/Detail Application by using the Master/Detail template of XCode. After starting the app, the title of the navigation button for the master view is just "Master". Now I waant tio rename that button, but unfortunately I don't know how to access this button. In appdelegate.m there is the following code to initialize the views: MasterViewController *masterViewController = [[MasterViewController alloc] init];
UINavigationController *masterNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:masterViewController];

DetailViewController *detailViewController = [[DetailViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"DetailViewController" bundle:nil];
UINavigationController *detailNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:detailViewController]
 I tried these ways without success: masterViewController.navigationItem.title = @"newTitle";
 or masterNavigationController.navigationItem.title = @"newTitle";
 As I wasn't sure, if the name of the button is just the title of the view behind idt, I also tried that: masterViewController.title = @"newTitle"; Nothing worked. But as the title of the button is "Master" and I definitely didn't set it, I believe there must be some way to set it. Does anyone know how to do it? Just to show the button:
@CODE:MasterViewController *masterViewController = [[MasterViewController alloc] init];
UINavigationController *masterNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:masterViewController];

DetailViewController *detailViewController = [[DetailViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"DetailViewController" bundle:nil];

@TITLE:SQL Server - Is it possible to return an existing column value before a row update?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a query that updates a user's vote (ForumVotes) for a forum post (ForumPosts). Users can vote up or down (the vote will equal 1 or -1). This question is specific to changing a user's vote, so a vote record already exists in the ForumVotes table. The ForumPosts table stores the total score for each post, so I need to keep this field in synch. To recalculate the total score I need to first subtract the old vote before adding the new vote, so I need to get the old vote before updating the user's vote record. I know I can do this with 2 queries, but I'm wondering if it's possible (in SQL Server 2008) for an UPDATE to return the value of a column prior to performing the update? Here's an example: TABLE ForumPosts (
    postID bigint,
    score int,
    ... etc
)

-- existing vote is in this table:

TABLE ForumVotes (
    postFK bigint,
    userFK bigint,
    score int
)
 A simple query to update a user's vote UPDATE ForumVotes 
SET score = @newVote 
WHERE postFK = @postID
AND userFK = @userID
 Can this query be modified to return the old score before the update?
@CODE:TABLE ForumPosts (
    postID bigint,
    score int,
    ... etc
)

-- existing vote is in this table:

TABLE ForumVotes (
    postFK bigint,
    userFK bigint,
    score int

y = range(len(x))

# See matplotlib handle a series of datetimes just fine..
pyplot.plot(x, y)

 I'm not interested in the cause of the particular error shown, it's obvious enough that pandas expected a different version of matplotlib -- that's a fair risk of getting one package from the standard debian repository and the other through pip, and I already 'solved' that part of the problem by allowing pip to upgrade matplotlib. The real issue is -- and now comes a threefold question: how can it be that just importing pandas broke matplotlib's ability to handle datetime objects, when just two lines earlier pandas was clearly not even involved in that same operation? Does pandas upon import silently alter other modules in the top level namespace to force them to make use of pandas methods? And is this acceptable behavour for a python module? Because I need to be able to rely on it that importing, say, a random number module, won't silently change, say, the pickle module to apply a random salt to everything it writes.. Update with further information python is 2.6.6 (current debian stable from package 2.6.6-3+squeeze7) matplotlib version was debian's 0.99.3-1 (current debian stable from package python-matplotlib) pandas version was 0.9.0 (installed with 'pip install pandas', a while ago -- not today) Platform is an i386 running debian Squeeze Steps to replicate (obvious) Bootstrap a clean debian squeeze i386 installation and chroot into it. apt-get update apt-get install python python-matplotlib apt-get install python-pip build-essential python-dev pip install --upgrade numpy pip install pandas Now start an interactive python session import numpy

 Yes, I do have 2 submits in the same form, and both of them have name such as 'update' and 'destroy'. When the user press destroy button, update action in books_controller will be called. and it judges whether if it's 'update' or 'destroy' request. For that, how can I get its name parameter in controller? update action will be something like this def update

 if params[:books][:name] == 'destroy'
  destroy transaction
 else
  update transaction
 end

@CONTENT:I'm developing a Google Chrome extension which simulates keyboard events on a web-page. I found that event.initKeyboardEvent() does not work properly because of this webkit bug and I also found some workarounds, e.g. SO Question However, defining properties on event object is not working because extension's content script has its own "parallel world" so properties defined in content script are not visible to web-page script. My only and last hope that DOM 4 Event Constructors work in Google Chrome and it would be possible to properly initialize keyboard event through constructor var event = new KeyboardEvent("keypress", {key: 'U+0041', char: 'a', ... })
 Unfortunately, it fails with: TypeError: illegal constructor  
 I was not able to find any documentation on supported event constructors in Chrome. Could anyone point me to some docs/source code? Any other way to simulate keyboard events in a Google Chrome extension? (note, TextEvent won't help because many real-world controls listen to keydown/keyup specifically)

I want to develop a simple console application (.EXE) such that I can retreive the information from Task Manager -> Users Tab of any remote computer on our domain (Windows Server 2003 x86, or 2008R2 x64).

@TITLE:Python splines or other interpolations that work with time on x-axis?
@CONTENT:Trying to use the awfully useful pandas to deal with data as time series, I am now stumbling over the fact that there do not seem to exist libraries that can directly interpolate (with a spline or similar) over data that has DateTime as an x-axis? I always seem to be forced to convert first to some floating point number, like seconds since 1980 or something like that. I was trying the following things so far, sorry for the weird formatting, I have this stuff only in the ipython notebook, and I can't copy cells from there: from scipy.interpolate import InterpolatedUnivariateSpline as IUS

s = IUS(bb2temp.index.to_pydatetime(), bb2temp, k=1)

TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number
 By using bb2temp.index.values (that look like these: array([1970-01-15 184:00:35.884999, 1970-01-15 184:00:58.668999,

TypeError: array cannot be safely cast to required type
 I tried to use s(all_times) and s(all_times.to_pydatetime()) as well, with the same TypeError: array cannot be safely cast to required type. Am I, sadly, correct? Did everybody get used to convert times to floating points so much, that nobody thought it's a good idea that these interpolations should work automatically? (I would finally have found a super-useful project to contribute..) Or would you like to prove me wrong and earn some SO points? ;) Edit: Warning: Check your pandas data for NaNs before you hand it to the interpolation routines. They will not complain about anything but just silently fail.

@TITLE:SurfaceView in ScrollView under 4.1
@CONTENT:Here is the problem. For performance reasons, I choose to use a SurfaceView to draw a table-like form, and because this stuff is full of data I use a ScrollView as SurfaceView parent. Happy to see it works fine on my personal development-dedicated phone (HTC Desire HD 2.3.7), I tried to test it on one of my company development-dedicated phone (Google Nexus S 4.1.?) and then on my personal phone (HTC One X 4.1.1). Something went wrong on those two last ones, my SurfaceView just turned black after some ~80px scroll and turned back to what it should look like when I scrolled back under this ~80px (depends on screen size). Trying to avoid this blackout, I tested under some emulators... From 2.2 (customer's wish) to 4.0.4, it works just great. The joke is, under 4.2... it works too! Definitely, that is only under 4.1.x that the SurfaceView turns black! Here is my SurfaceView code, that I just copied from the sample you can find here. public class MySurfaceView extends SurfaceView
{
    public MySurfaceView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs)
    {
        super(context, attrs);
        // I use another SurfaceView behind to draw a grid
        // that is scroll independent with a white background
        this.setZOrderOnTop(true);
        // Same reason here
        this.getHolder().setFormat(PixelFormat.TRANSPARENT);
        this.getHolder().addCallback(this);
        this.getHolder().setSizeFromLayout();
        // Tried without this line and with "software" and "none" types too
        // and hardware acceleration on application and activity
        this.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE, null);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas)
    {
        super.onDraw(canvas);

        canvas.drawSomething()...
    }

    public void surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder)
    {
        this.setWillNotDraw(false);

        this.thread = new MySurfaceViewThread(this.getHolder(), this);
        this.thread.setRunning(true);
        this.thread.run();
    }

    public void surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder)
    {
        this.thread.setRunning(false);
        boolean retry = true;
        while(retry)

@TITLE:RestEasy Post Process Interceptor chain not traversed when response created by ExceptionMapper
@CONTENT:I am using RestEasy to build up my Restful web services. I have implemented ExceptionMappers to prepare specific exception responses. I have also implemented MessageBodyWriterInterceptors and a couple of PostProcessorInterceptors. Issue: All works fine when any resource does not throw any exception. My implementation works as expected. All the post processor interceptors and the message body writer interceptors are called. But when an exception is thrown from any of the resource methods, the registered ExceptionMappers are called and it is creating the response. But in this case the post processor interceptor chain is not traversed. They are not getting called. What should I do in this case. Write that interceptor logic in my exception mapper or is there is solution available?

@TITLE:Fire-forget and One-Way Calls in ASP.NET WebApi
@CONTENT:I totally understand that HTTP world is not the best choice for one-way calls and that WebApi is designed best for HTTP verbose communications. No doubt, WCF is the winner here. But, what if you already have an ApiController with a bunch of verbs exposed and at some point you needed to have a single one-way call too? And you don't want to host/maintain another service (WCF) for that. Task<HttpResponseMessage> response = client.PostAsJsonAsync<Log>("api/log", log)
 If you don't handle the response then you've got something similar to fire-and-forget. Is this the only way in WebApi or there's another solution?

@LINK:/questions/13936573/javafx-crashes-x-server
@TITLE:JavaFX crashes X Server
@CONTENT:Background/Context: I'm currently developing a touch screen application which is aimed to run on Linux. As a development framework I chose JavaFX (jdk1.7.0_10) due to its rapid prototyping easiness. I'm using Arch Linux (kernel 3.6.10-1-ARCH) distribution and since JavaFX needs a head-full environment to run, I installed Xorg on top of the base configuration. Even thought I'm able to run my JavaFX application, I have some issues with popup windows that are being displayed in my application. When trying to display those popup windows, sometimes they don't respond as expected or event worse, they crash my application. The error I get is the following: The program 'java' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 51101 error_code 9 request_code 62 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
 By the way, when running the same application on Windows (my development machine), everything works fine. I also tried to run a composite manager ('xcompmgr') since i was also getting some warnings like Can't create transparent stage, because your screen doesn't support alpha channel. You need to enable XComposite extension.
 but it didn't helped. Question: Am i missing some files or configurations in order to run smoothly JavaFX in Linux, or has any one encountered the same challenge? Since my main concern is performance (due to limited hardware specs), I don't want to install a full featured Linux distribution. I only need to run my JavaFX application.

 Unfortunately this doesnt work... I need to use vector<double>::value_type but that makes code less readable. Can it be made to work? I dont like sizeof vd.front() because it just looks ugly to write front() for this. EDIT: decltype variants also fit in what I would call ugly category...

@TITLE:Chrome float right resize bug?
@CONTENT:I have an input and a button in a div. When the viewport is wide, the button is floated right and on small screens the button fills the width of the viewport. However, in Chrome when I resize the browser to smaller than the breakpoint and then back again the button stays on its own row. It works as I expect on IE and FF. If I set float: left on the input it works in Chrome too. Here's a fiddle demonstrating the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/kSRvP/ Resize the output pane back and forth to see the bug. Why does Chrome behave this way? I'm guessing it's because Chrome optimizes the redraw cycle somehow and skips the step where the button is inline (between removing display: block and setting float: right) but I'm not sure and would like to know if it's a bug or not.

@TITLE:Is directly accessing the backing array of a String justified in some cases?
@CONTENT:I'm working on optimizing text processing software, in which the following class is used a lot: class Sentence {

  private final char[] textArray;
  private final String textString; 

  public Sentence(String text) {
     this.textArray = text.toCharArray();
     this.textString = text;
  }

  public String getString() {
     return textString;
  }

  public char[] getArray() {
     return textArray;
  } 
}
 As you can see, there is some redundancy: the backing array of the textString is always equal to the textArray, yet both are stored. I'm hoping to reduce the memory footprint of this class, by getting rid of the textArray field. There is one problem : this class is used widely througout out codebase, thus I cannot get rid of getArray() method. My solution is to get rid of the textArray field, and let the getArray() method return the textSting's backing array instead via reflection. The result would be something like: class Sentence {

  private final String textString; 

  public Sentence(String text) {
       this.textString = text;
  }

  public String getString() {
     return textString;
  }

  public char[] getArray() {
     return getBackingArrayUsingReflection(textString);
  } 
}
 It seems like a viable solution, but I suspect a String's backing array is private for a reason. What are potential problems with this approach?
@CODE:class Sentence {

  private final char[] textArray;
  private final String textString; 

  public Sentence(String text) {
     this.textArray = text.toCharArray();
     this.textString = text;
  }

  public String getString() {
     return textString;
  }

  public char[] getArray() {
     return textArray;
  } 
} class Sentence {

  private final String textString; 

  public Sentence(String text) {
       this.textString = text;
  }

  public String getString() {
     return textString;
  }

  public char[] getArray() {
     return getBackingArrayUsingReflection(textString);
  }

@TITLE:EntityFramework anonymous composite key property name conflict
@CONTENT:I'm using EntityFramework 5 (or 4.3 for .Net Framework 4.0) In my DbContext object I have already set the correct DbSets and the objects contain proper references to each other. This is not new for me, and things are working well. Now in this case I have some composite keys that, sometimes, include the foreign key of a table (or object in this case). For this I use the HasKey<>() function on the OnModelCreating method of the DbContext. When these properties have different names, there is no problem, but when these properties have the same name, the migration cannot be done. An example: protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // ...

        modelBuilder.Entity<PatientVisit>().ToTable("PatientVisits");
        modelBuilder.Entity<PatientVisit>().HasKey(x => 
            new { x.Patient.Code, x.Code });

        // ...

        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    }
 As you can see in the code provided, the object PatientVisit has a property named Code, but this property can be repeated as long as it is repeated with a different patient. The entity Patient also has a key defined named Code. An anonymous type cannot have two properties inferring the same name (obvious). The typical solution would be to name the properties of the anonymous type like this: protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // ...

        modelBuilder.Entity<PatientVisit>().ToTable("PatientVisits");
        modelBuilder.Entity<PatientVisit>().HasKey(x => 
            new { PatientCode = x.Patient.Code, VisitCode = x.Code });

        // ...

        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    }
 But doing this, when I try to add a migration this error message is thrown. The properties expression 'x => new <>f__AnonymousType3`2(PatientCode 
= x.Patient.Code, VisitCode = x.Code)' is not valid. The expression 
should represent a property: C#: 't => t.MyProperty'  VB.Net: 'Function(t)
t.MyProperty'. When specifying multiple properties use an anonymous 
type: C#: 't => new { t.MyProperty1, t.MyProperty2 }'  
VB.Net: 'Function(t) New With { t.MyProperty1, t.MyProperty2 }'.
@CODE:HasKey<>() OnModelCreating protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // ...

        modelBuilder.Entity<PatientVisit>().ToTable("PatientVisits");
        modelBuilder.Entity<PatientVisit>().HasKey(x => 
            new { x.Patient.Code, x.Code });

        // ...

        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    } protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)

@TITLE:Extend Google Spreadsheets UI with a Google Web App
@CONTENT:I created a script for Google Spreadsheets, this script just adds a new menu item as described here Custom Menu Items in a Spreadsheet. Then I deploy this script as a Web App and I want all users who install the app to be able to see the new menu item. And I'm stuck at this point. As I understand, when you deploy a script as a Web App, onOpen functions looses it's meaning. So, inside doGet I create custom trigger for onOpen event, attach myOnOpen handler to it and inside myOnOpen I add a menu item, but the item doesn't show up. Here's my code: function doGet() {
    var newSheet = SpreadsheetApp.create("new sheet");
    var newId = newSheet.getId();
    ScriptProperties.setProperty('newId', newId); 

    ScriptApp.newTrigger("myOnOpen")
        .forSpreadsheet(newId)
        .onOpen()
        .create();
};

function myOnOpen() {
    var newId = ScriptProperties.getProperty('newId');
    var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(newId);

    var entries = [ { name : "Show bingo", functionName : "Bingo" } ];
    sheet.addMenu("My Menu", entries);
};

function Bingo() {
    Browser.msgBox("Bingo!");
};
 So, when a user who installed the app opens "new sheet" spreadsheet, he doesn't see the "My Menu". What am I doing wrong here? Why the menu item doesn't show up? At the end of the day I want to create a Web App which extends Google Spreadsheets UI with additional menus and dialogs. Any advice is welcome. Thanks!

    var newSheet = SpreadsheetApp.create("new sheet");

    var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(newId);

@TITLE:Dynamically loading large amount of data in JTable
@CONTENT:Here is my problem: I currently have a JTable containing anywhere from 5,000 to well over 200,000 rows. You see where I'm going with this. The data is already loaded into memory, which isn't a problem, but how can I create an efficient JTable so that it only loads the rows that are visible and that any events only act on those rows that are visible in the viewport? Obviously scrolling is nearly impossible with this much data, as it takes forever for the system to repaint and fire events. Basically I think one solution would be to determine which rows are in the viewport, then create a new model containing those rows perhaps?

@TITLE:AngularJs full Jquery selection not working
@CONTENT:I am trying to manipulate DOM in an AngularJS Directive using a Jquery plugin. I am not sure if AngularJs is using the full version of Jquery or not, although the full version script is on the head while AngularJs script is on the body so in theory AngularJS should use the full version. However, the log entry inside directive does not show anything is selected. While the exact same syntax inside Chrome console returns all the lis inside the ul. Here's the Html <ul id="myUl"  class="gallery unstyled">
    <li class="galleryitem" ng-repeat="i in images">
        <a href="{{i.LargeImage.URL}}"><img ng-src="{{i.MediumImage.URL}}" /></a>

 Directive .directive('gallery',function() {
    return {

        link : function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) {
        console.log($(".gallery li"));
      }
    }
   }
 PS: I just realized that console.log($(".gallery"));
 does return the ul with li within them but not console.log($(".gallery li"));
 Which makes me think that the full version is not loaded.
@CODE:<ul id="myUl"  class="gallery unstyled">
    <li class="galleryitem" ng-repeat="i in images">

@TITLE:Is it a proper way to implement a custom validator in the 'lib/' directory?
@CONTENT:I am using Ruby on Rails 3.2.9. A way to solve "Trouble on extending Rails in a sub-directory of the 'lib' directory" related to Custom Validators was to state the following code (note the directory where the file is located) # lib/extension/rails/custom_validator.rb
class CustomValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  # ...
end
 and to put the config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib/extension/rails) statement in the config/application.rb file. This way the CustomValidator is correctly loaded when starting the server and my lib/ directory is organized as I'd expect. However, I would like to know if that is a "proper" / "right" way to make these kind of things in RoR. In other words, is there a better approach to accomplish the same? Note: In order to organize code in files I am thinking to namespace classes as-like the following: # lib/extension/rails/custom_validator.rb
module Extension
  module Rails
    class CustomValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
      # ...
    end
  end
end
 But, by using the above code, it seems that there isn't an easy way to make the CustomValidator to work, even if I state config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib) in the config/application.rb file.
@CODE:# lib/extension/rails/custom_validator.rb
class CustomValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  # ...
end config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib/extension/rails) config/application.rb CustomValidator lib/ # lib/extension/rails/custom_validator.rb
module Extension
  module Rails
    class CustomValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
      # ...

  end
end CustomValidator config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib) config/application.rb

@TITLE:Intent flags - How to start a new activity instance and have others closed
@CONTENT:I am not really familiar with intent flags, so please, bear with me. I am doing an application which displays stuff from a database in a ViewPager. I also have a widget which from time to time pulls out a random row and displays it. Now, when I click on it, I am taken to an activity where the same content is displayed and now I can take action on it. Everything works, however when I have an activity already running and then click on the widget, it seems it creates a new instance, because when I press the Back button I am not exiting the application but am taken to the previous instance or something. Is there a way to start a new instance of an activity and if there were some previous instances running close them, using flags? I played around with CLEAR_TOP and that stuff but I honestly don't know what am I doing. Thanks! //EDIT Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP doesn't seem to do anything. Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP seems to bring the previous one to the top and ignores the new one or something. Maybe let me rephrase, I start the activity from launcher icon, then I press the Home button and click on widget and it should bring up a new instance where ViewPager.setCurrentItem sets the correct page (same as in widget). If there were no main activity running before, everything is okay, but if it was running, finish it. MyWidgetProvider extends AppWidgetProvider

@Override
public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int[] appWidgetIds) {

@CONTENT:I am trying to create a template matching function on Android using OpenCV with Java (not with native). My problem is displaying the image. The class mattoBitmap works (in Java) but if I want to convert the result of the template matching function I get a FATAL EXCEPTION when I call the Utils.matToBitmap function. Below is the relevant code: void TemplateMatch() {

    mFind = new Mat(256, 192, CvType.CV_8UC4);
    Input = new Mat(256, 192, CvType.CV_8UC4);

    mResult = new Mat(217, 153, CvType.CV_8UC4); // (bmp2 size is 40)

    Utils.bitmapToMat(bmp2, mFind);
    Utils.bitmapToMat(bmp1, Input);

    Imgproc.matchTemplate(mFind, Input, mResult, Imgproc.TM_SQDIFF);

    bmp3 = Bitmap.createBitmap(mResult.cols(), mResult.rows(), conf);

    Utils.matToBitmap(mResult, bmp3);

    iv2.setImageBitmap(bmp3);

}
 The size of mResult to my knowledge is not important when it is created becuase it is set afterwards by the template match function. Do I need to convert the mResult mat to something before I convert it to bmp? Do I need to convert the bmp to something before I can convert the mat to it?
@CODE:FATAL EXCEPTION Utils.matToBitmap void TemplateMatch() {

@TITLE:Django 1.4 serving MEDIA_URL and STATIC_URL files on development server
@CONTENT:Just upgraded to Django 1.4, and having serious trouble with the new 'improved' serving of static and media files on development server. I love Django, but why on earth they have made serving these files doubly more complicated with STATIC_URL,STATIC_ROOT, STATICFILES_DIR now is utterly beyond me. I'm simply trying to serve all files, static and uploaded, on the development server. I have the STATIC_URL files working, after much experimentation, but I simply cannot get the MEDIA_URL files to be served as well. Settings: DIRNAME = os.path.dirname(__file__)
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'media/')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
STATIC_ROOT = ''
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = ()
 I've got the media and static context processors added: TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
"django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",
"django.core.context_processors.debug",
"django.core.context_processors.i18n",
'django.core.context_processors.media',
'django.core.context_processors.static',
"django.core.context_processors.request",
'satchmo_store.shop.context_processors.settings',
'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
 ) and I've added in the url confs: # serve static and uploaded files in DEV
urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()
urlpatterns + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
 with the two conf settings added as indicated in the docs, first one for static, second for media. my structure, website being an app and static dir placed inside it as instructed on djangoproject: <myproject>
  --media
  --settings
  --templates
  --website
      |->static
 In templates I can serve static content no problem with {{STATIC_URL}}css/style.css
 But any uploaded image, this one using photologue, is not served, but the urls are correct: /media/photologue/photos/cache/spawning-2_admin_thumbnail.jpg
 That directory structure does exit under media/ Super, super confused. It all seems so ridiculously complicated now, whereas I never had any issues before.
@CODE:DIRNAME = os.path.dirname(__file__)
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'media/')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

@TITLE:Difference between `JUnit Plug-in Test` and `JUnit Test` in eclipse
@CONTENT:In the eclipse run command, there are two choices: JUnit Plug-in Test and JUnit Test. Before, I tried to launch eclipse plugin test (org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.refactoring), and I had some issues ( Debugging eclipse unit test code "Test class should have exactly one" and "Workspace is closed" error ). The issue was that when I tried to launch the debugger with JUnit Test, I got Workspace is closed error. In eclipse configuration, they have the same workspace. What is the difference between the two? And especially, how does workspace work for them? Why I have Workspace is closed error with JUnit Test run? Is it possible to launch eclipse plugin test with JUnit Test?

@LINK:/questions/13892045/regular-expression-matches-an-extra-empty-group
@TITLE:Regular expression matches an extra empty group
@CONTENT:I'm new to the domain of regular expressions. All I'll post below are simplified examples from my code. I have a string, let's say test_1,some_2,foo,bar_4, that I want to replace by title: test (1) title: some (2) title: foo () title: bar (4) What I have now is (which works): var test = "test_1,some_2,foo,bar_4,";
console.log(test.replace(/(.*?)(?:_(\d))?,/g, "title: $1 ($2)\n"));
 which outputs: title: test (1)
title: some (2)
title: foo ()
title: bar (4)
 In an effort to makes things right, I want to get rid off the coma after the last item. The list will look like test_1,some_2,foo,bar_4 (no coma after bar_4) So the new code: var test = "test_1,some_2,foo,bar_4";
console.log(test.replace(/(.*?)(?:_(\d))?(?:,|$)/g, "title: $1 ($2) "));
 outputs something wrong. There's an extra empty match at the end: title: test (1)
title: some (2)
title: foo ()
title: bar (4)
title:  ()
 My questions are: Why? How to fix it? Is there any possible improvements in the actual regex? demo jsFiddle
@CODE:test_1,some_2,foo,bar_4, title: test (1) title: some (2) title: foo () title: bar (4) var test = "test_1,some_2,foo,bar_4,";
console.log(test.replace(/(.*?)(?:_(\d))?,/g, "title: $1 ($2)\n")); title: test (1)

One approach is to load all the sprites upfront, and then put the correct sprite in the constructors of the entities. However, I want to decode the bitmaps lazily, so that the constructors of the entities will decode the bitmaps. The only problem with this is that duplicated entities will load the same bitmap twice, using 2x the memory (Or n times if the entity is created n times). To fix this, I built a SingularBitmapFactory that will store a decoded Bitmap into a hash, and if the same bitmap is asked for again, will simply return the previously hashed one instead of building a new one. Problem with this, though, is that the factory holds a copy of all bitmaps, and so won't ever get garbage collected. What's the best way to switch the hashmap to one with weakly referenced values? In otherwords, I want a structure where the values won't be GC'd if any other object holds a reference to it, but as long as no other objects refers it, then it can be GC'd.

 i am displaying the result with Debugger::dump() method, and the result is just using the last 'OR' condition, not both 'OR' conditions: array(

@TITLE:Is there anyway to get all files names without exceptions in C#?
@CONTENT:Update: I be glad to drop the C# requirement, and just see any program that can list all the files running as Admin or System, my question is has anyone seen such a thing? There are numerous methods of enumerating files in a directory, but all suffer the same problems: "The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters." "Access to the path 'C:\Users\All Users\Application Data' is denied" etc. Even running under admin, single user machine, it seems impossible to list all the files without encountering exceptions\errors. Is it really an impossible task just to get list of all the files under windows? Has anyone ever been able to obtain the complete list of all files on their machine using C# or any other method? This link from MS with the title "Enumerate Directories and Files" , does not show how to Enumerate Directories and Files, it only show a subset of what that will not throw : DirectoryNotFoundException, UnauthorizedAccessException, PathTooLongException, Update : Here is sample code to run over C and attempt to enumerate all the files and errors. Even when running this as admin there are folders that not only can be access, but I even can't change their ownership to Admin! for example : "C:\Windows\CSC" just have look at "Errors {0}.csv" log file to see how many places are inaccessible to admin. using System;

So if the mouse is set to move a child element up on drag that child element will now be moving down (depending on how you have things set up). -webkit-transform: rotateX(?deg) rotateY(?deg) rotateZ(?deg); // where does it point?
 ONLY SETUP FOR WEBKIT Take a look at the fiddle (code is a mess, stripped down). Draw 360 tic marks, arranged in a circle, on your computer monitor. How can you tell what tic mark the arrow is pointing to (assuming the box is at the exact center of the circle)? A tutorial that covers the basics is here, here. *edit - the transform-origin being used is at the center of the cube
@CODE:-webkit-transform: rotateX(?deg) rotateY(?deg) rotateZ(?deg); // where does it point?

@TITLE:CSS3 animation pause/unpause skipping & jumping in webkit
@CONTENT:I have implemented animation pausing as described here: How to pause and resume CSS3 animation using JavaScript? Here is my CSS for the rotating element: .is-rotating{
    -webkit-animation: circle 55s linear infinite;
    -moz-animation: circle 55s linear infinite;
    -ms-animation: circle 55s linear infinite;
    animation: circle 55s linear infinite;
}
 I toggle a is-paused class to the elements in question onmouseover: .is-paused{
    -webkit-animation-play-state:paused;
    -moz-animation-play-state:paused;
    -o-animation-play-state:paused; 
    animation-play-state:paused;
}
 When I remove this class with JS (onmouseout), the rotating animation resets to the 'origin' point. Sometimes it does, sometimes not. This happens in webkit (Chrome and Safari on OSX), works fine in FF. I know animation-play-state is an experimental feature, but MDN says it should work fine in webkit. Does anyone have any ideas on how to implement for webkit browsers? UPDATE: here is the rest of the CSS: @-webkit-keyframes circle {
    from { -webkit-transform:rotate(0deg); }

@TITLE:p:commandButton with p:fileDownload and no ajax only works in second click
@CONTENT:I'm using JSF 2.0, Primefaces 3.4.2, Spring 3.1.2. I'm facing a similar problem of the guy of this link: h:commandButton works from the second click. Like him I'm not using ajax in the <p:commandButton> but I'm using a <p:fileDownload /> inside the button tag. I have two views: "list.xhtml" and "downloadView.xhtml". In myBean.java I send a DataModel from view "list.xhtml" to view "downloadView.xhtml" as a request attribute as shown in the code below: FacesUtil.getServletContext().setAttribute("myDataModelFromRequest", this.myDataModel);
 The bean is anotted with @Scope("view") In view "downloadView.xhtml" I populated succesfully a dataTable with the DataModel sent from request. But the problem happens when I click in the button to download the file. It only works on second try. I already tried to change the return of my method from null to "downloadView" but the problem was not solved. In debug mode I noticed that only enter in the "downloadMethod()" on second click. Anyone have an idea to solve it? myBean.java public String viewListMethod() {
    //some work here...

    FacesUtil.getServletContext().setAttribute("myDataModelFromRequest", this.myDataModel);

    return "downloadView";

@TITLE:jQuery.get doesn't receive latest version of file on server [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Prevent caching of AJAX call I'm using jQuery to read a tiny text file on a web server: jQuery.get('scores.txt', function(data) {
    parseScores(data);
});
 This nearly works as it should -- but it doesn't reliably load the latest version of the file. Even if story.txt has changed, refreshing the page returns exactly the same value for data. The server is standard Mac OS Apache, with no caching enabled, and it's the same machine as the client -- so in theory there are no other caches sitting between me and it. If I load http://127.0.0.1/scores.txt into the browser then it always opens the latest version. Looking at the Apache log, for the times the page fails to update, the jQuery GET request never reaches the server. I have a suspicion that I might need to move this question to serverfault.com, but can anyone see a problem with my JavaScript that would make it behave in this way? Is there any way of using JavaScript/jQuery to force the browser to request a new copy of the file? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Ignore multiple specific files with svn
@CONTENT:Our build system generates a number of files that are scattered around the source tree. These files the show up when running svn status In the example below all of the files with a '?' in the thirdparty directory have been generated by the build system. e.g. svn status
M       common/db/unit_test/src/db_payload_builder_test_suite.cpp
?       common/db/unit_test/Makefile

?       thirdparty/lib/curl/originals/src/curl
 I would like to tell svn to ignore these files. I cannot simply specify directories that should be ignored since many of these directories contain sources that are checked in to the repository. The example above is a subset of the files that are generated, we cannot use an ignore pattern because some of the generated files match files that we do not wish to ignore (e.g. xxx_.h" ) I have tried using svn propset svn:ignore 'somefile' dir but I can only manage to tell svn to ignore one specific file per directory. How can I specify multiple specific files for svn to ignore?

@TITLE:how to escape characters when using server side delimiters
@CONTENT:So, currently, within an asp gridview, I have the following <span id="btnEdit" runat="server" onclick="ShowEditCriteriaFilterDialog('<%#Eval("intSMCID")%>', '<%#Eval("strDescription")%>')" class="linkText">Edit</span>
 What I'm essentially looking for is the syntax for quotes/double-quotes to actually accomplish this properly, as what I have above doesn't properly work. First of all, if i encapsulate the entire onclick with single quotes, and not put any other quotes inside, it works for rendering purposes, but when i actually click the link at runtime, nothing happens. If I encapsulate the entire onclick with double-quotes, like most properties of an ASPX element, it doesn't render properly, and everything after the comma which is after the first <%#Eval %> statement shows up as actual text on the screen. This leads me to believe there needs to be some escaping done to prevent it from thinking the click handler ends somewhere in the middle of that <%#Eval %> statement. note that if I take away runat="server" and just encapsulate it in double-quotes, that seems to work better...but i need the span to be a server-side control for alot of other functionality I have in the page's code behind where I need to access the control through FindControl

@CONTENT:I'm having problems with the HtmlHelper, RadioButtonFor and an enum in my model. I have a strongly typed view, and I want the checkboxes to toggle my enum property. Enum.cs

 If I set the MyProperty value in the controller, the RadioButton is checked as expected. But after a post to the next wizard step, which gets the model as parameter, the property isn't set. If it will help you to understand what I mean: If it would be C# and WPF I would use a IValueConverter. btw: I use a HtmlHelper.ActionLink to get the model to the controller. Thanks in advance

@TITLE:Should I choose Boost Asio or Aysnc Socket threads in Android?
@CONTENT:I am in process of developing an network based UI app for Android which would perform following kind of functionalities Needs to communicate with TCP servers running on n/w based embedded devices (>100 at a time). Polling these devices at regular intervals for fetching updated information Sending and receiving information from those devices All above information would be controlled and managed by application's UI Considering above situations, the app would probably have to spawn multiple thread's for multiple connections and managing them.So my query is Is it good approach to develop the network module using Boost.Asio libraries ? Or it is okay to open upto 100 of socket threads for connectivity? If Boost.Asio is used, then network module would be developed seperately using NDK, to access JNI would come into place, which in turn could lead to slow response? Alternatively, can there be other better options? Looking forward for your inputs! Many thanks in advance.

@TITLE:downloading XML file from sql reporting server
@CONTENT:I am trying to download a xml file from Azure SQL reporting server which requires authentication to get the file. I am trying below 2 approaches: Approach 1 In this approach i tried below c# console application and it downloads the file from server. It works fine! void DownloadFile(string uname, string password)
{
        ServerReport report = new ServerReport();
        report.ReportServerUrl = new System.Uri("https://xxxxx.reporting.windows.net/ReportServer", System.UriKind.Absolute);
        report.ReportPath = "/Demo2.rdl";
        report.ReportServerCredentials.SetFormsCredentials(null, uname, password, "xxxxx.reporting.windows.net");
        byte[] data = report.Render("XML");
        FileStream fs = new FileStream(@"c:\output.xml", FileMode.Create);
        fs.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
        fs.Close();
}
 Approach 2 Now i want to download the same file from a windows phone application. Now since ServerReport is not present in windows phone i am relying in WebClient to download the file. So i am trying below code and it doesn't seem to work: void DownloadFile(string uname, string password)
{
    WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
    webClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(uname, password, "xxxxx.reporting.windows.net");    
    webClient.DownloadFile("https://xxxxx.reporting.windows.net/ReportServer?%2fDemo2.rdl&rs:Command=Render&rs:Format=XML", @"c:\output.xml");
}

 What could be the problem with the approach 2, are we missing any thing? Update I am quite new to this azure and web services. I might be asking some silly question. Here is what i tried: I tried adding a "Service reference" to azure sql reporting server in my windows phone 7 project. One thing i noted was that i can not add the serice as "Web reference" as it is disabled in windows phone 7 application. After adding serive to my app i am getting set of classes. And one of them is ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient; ReportExecutionService is not available. I am not quite sure on how to use ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient api to get the cookie which i can use for WebClient. Any sample application on how to use these APIs would be great. I tried searching over internet but couldn't get more information. Below is what i tried but the cookie count is null. ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient client = new ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient();
void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "XXXX";
    client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "XXXX";
    client.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
    client.LogonUserCompleted += new EventHandler<System.ComponentModel.AsyncCompletedEventArgs>(client_LogonUserCompleted);
    client.LogonUserAsync("XXXX", "XXXX", "xxxx.reporting.windows.net");
}

void client_LogonUserCompleted(object sender, System.ComponentModel.AsyncCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    int count = client.CookieContainer.Count;  // NULL COOKIE COUNT!!!
}
 Below is ClientConfig file. I have added enableHttpCookieContainer="true".     <configuration>
        <system.serviceModel>
            <bindings>
                <basicHttpBinding>
                    <binding name="ReportExecutionServiceSoap" maxBufferSize="2147483647"
                        enableHttpCookieContainer="true"
                             maxReceivedMessageSize="2147483647">
                        <security mode="Transport" />
                    </binding>
                </basicHttpBinding>
            </bindings>
            <client>
                <endpoint address="https://xxxx.reporting.windows.net:443/ReportServer/ReportExecution2005.asmx"
                    binding="basicHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="ReportExecutionServiceSoap"
                    contract="SqlReportingService.ReportExecutionServiceSoap"
                    name="ReportExecutionServiceSoap" />
            </client>
        </system.serviceModel>
    </configuration>
 Please let me know what is missing. SOLVED - Finally i am able to download xml file from Azure Sql reporting server. - Below is the solution. - First add a service reference to the Sql reporting server. - Then do a ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient::LogonUserAsync. - Use the obtained cookie with the WebClient for further request.      public class WebClientExtended : WebClient
            {
                private CookieContainer myContainer;
                private HttpWebRequest myRequest;

                public WebClientExtended(CookieContainer containter) 
                { 
                    myContainer = containter; 
                }

                public CookieContainer Cookies
                {
                    get { return myContainer; }
                    set { myContainer = value; }
                }

                protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri address)
                {
                    myRequest = (HttpWebRequest)base.GetWebRequest(address);
                    myRequest.Method = "GET";
                    myRequest.CookieContainer = Cookies;
                    return myRequest;
                }

                protected override WebResponse GetWebResponse(WebRequest request, IAsyncResult result)
                {
                    return myRequest.EndGetResponse(result);
                }
            }

            ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient rs = new ReportExecutionServiceSoapClient();
            string servername = "XXXX.reporting.windows.net";
            string uname = "XXXX";

@LINK:/questions/13852209/localstorage-unreliable-in-firefox
@TITLE:localStorage unreliable in Firefox
@CONTENT:I'm working on a deck building application for a card game I play. I'm using localStorage to save and retrieve decks. It seems to be working flawlessly in Chrome, but in Firefox it is working unreliably. In FF, everything seems to work fine at first, the deck even persists through a reload. However, if I add a second deck and reload, it only finds the first deck. If I delete the first deck, it no longer finds anything. All the local storage interaction is in scripts/vault.js, which I'll reproduce below. Am I doing something wrong? vault = {};
vault.makeKey = function (s) {
    return "deck:" + s;
};
vault.friendlyName = function(s) {
    if (s.indexOf("deck:") === 0) {
        return s.substring(5);
    } else {
        return s;
    }
};
vault.store = function (deck, name) {
    if (!window.localStorage) {
        alert("This browser doesn't support local storage. You will be unable to save decks.");
        return;
    }
    var key = vault.makeKey(name);
    localStorage.setItem(key, deck.export());
};
vault.retrieve = function (key) {
    deck.import(localStorage[key]);
};
vault.getDecks = function () {
    var keys = Object.keys(localStorage),
        out = [],
        i,
        k,
        name = "";
    for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
        k = keys[i];
        name = vault.friendlyName(k);
        if (name !== k && localStorage[k]) {
            out.push({name: name, key: k});
        }
    }
    out.sort(function (a, b) {
        return a.name > b.name ? 1 : -1;
    });
    return out;
};
vault.deleteDeck = function (key) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
};
 Basically, it seems like at some point the keys in localStorage get 'frozen' for lack of a better term; localStorage will behave correctly while I manipulate it, but as soon as I refresh the page it seems to revert to whichever state it got frozen in.
@CODE:vault = {};
vault.makeKey = function (s) {

    } else {
        return s;
    }
};
vault.store = function (deck, name) {
    if (!window.localStorage) {
        alert("This browser doesn't support local storage. You will be unable to save decks.");
        return;
    }
    var key = vault.makeKey(name);
    localStorage.setItem(key, deck.export());
};
vault.retrieve = function (key) {
    deck.import(localStorage[key]);
};
vault.getDecks = function () {
    var keys = Object.keys(localStorage),
        out = [],
        i,
        k,
        name = "";
    for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
        k = keys[i];
        name = vault.friendlyName(k);
        if (name !== k && localStorage[k]) {
            out.push({name: name, key: k});
        }
    }
    out.sort(function (a, b) {
        return a.name > b.name ? 1 : -1;
    });
    return out;
};

@LINK:/questions/13850506/android-fragment-going-back-without-recreating-reloading-fragment
@TITLE:Android Fragment, going back without recreating/reloading Fragment
@CONTENT:I've seen quite a few questions on SO about Fragments and I still can't seem to figure out if what I want to do is possible, and more so if my design pattern is just flawed and I need to re-work the entire process. Basically, like most questions that have been asked, I have an ActionBar with NavigationTabs (using ActionBarSherlock), then within each Tab there is a FragementActivity and then the FragmentActivities push new Fragments when a row is selected (I'm trying to re-create an iOS Project in Android and it's just a basic Navigation based app with some tabs that can drill down into specific information). When I click the back button on the phone the previous Fragment is loaded but the Fragment re-creates itself (so the WebServices are called again for each view) and this isn't needed since the information won't change in a previous view when going backwards. So basically what I want to figure out is how do I setup my Fragments so that when I push the back button on the phone, the previous Fragment is just pulled up with the previous items already created. Below is my current code :     //This is from my FragmentActivity Class that contains the ActionBar and Tab Selection Control
    @Override
public void onTabSelected(ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    int selectedTab = tab.getPosition();

    if (selectedTab == 0) {
        SalesMainScreen salesScreen = new SalesMainScreen();
        ft.replace(R.id.content, salesScreen);
    }
    else if (selectedTab == 1) {
        ClientMainScreen clientScreen = new ClientMainScreen();
        ft.replace(R.id.content, clientScreen);
    }.....

   //This is within the ClientMainScreen Fragment Class, which handles moving to the Detail Fragment
   row.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void onClick(View view) {
                            //Do something if Row is clicked
                            try{
                                String selectedClientName = clientObject.getString("ClientName");
                                String selectedClientID = clientObject.getString("ClientID");
                                String selectedValue = clientObject.getString("ClientValue");
                                transaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
                                ClientDetailScreen detailScreen = new ClientDetailScreen();
                                detailScreen.clientID = selectedClientID;
                                detailScreen.clientName = selectedClientName;
                                detailScreen.clientValue = selectedValue;
                                int currentID = ((ViewGroup)getView().getParent()).getId();
                                transaction.replace(currentID,detailScreen);
                                transaction.addToBackStack(null);
                                transaction.commit();

                            }
                            catch (Exception e) {
                                e.printStackTrace();
                            }
                        }
                    });....

     //And then this is the Client Detail Fragment, with the method being called to Call the Web Service and create thew (since what is displayed on this screen is dependent on what is found in the Web Service
          @Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup group, Bundle saved) {
    return inflater.inflate(R.layout.clientdetailscreen, group, false);
}

@Override
public void onActivityCreated (Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);

    //Setup Preferences File Link
    this.preferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(getActivity());

    //initialize the table object
    mainTable = (TableLayout)getActivity().findViewById(R.id.mainTable);

    //setup the detail table
    setupRelatedClientSection();

}
 The Client Detail Screen can then drill down one more time, using the same method as the Client Main Screen but when I go back from that new screen to the Detail Screen the seuptRelatedClientSection() method is called again and so the entire Fragment is rebuilt when really I just want to pull up a saved version of that screen. Is this possible with my current setup, or did I approach this the wrong way?

@TITLE:Unable to cast DTE, project or solution to VCProject and VCCodeModel
@CONTENT:I am trying to get some information about c+= programs, through code. I have had some success with EnvDTE, now I need to use VCProject and VCCodeModel and I am running into casting problems (hope that is all...) In the working class, I have a DTE "application" passed from the Connect. I have: EnvDTE.Project project = application.SelectedItems.Item(1).Project;
EnvDTE.Solution sol = (EnvDTE.Solution)application.Solution;
 I would like to use "project", not the first project in the solution as the examples I have found on the web - as below - but mostly, I would like to have something that works first. For VCProject, I have tried (off Microsoft's web site, and all other web examples): VCProject vcProject = (VCProject)application.Solution.Projects.Item(1).Object;
MessageBox.Show(vcProject.ProjectDirectory);
 or... just VCProject vcProject = (VCProject)project.Object;
 For VCCodeModel, I translated to c# http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.vccodemodel.vccodeinclude.aspx: public void GetAllIncludes()
{
  VCCodeModel vcCM = (VCCodeModel)application.Solution.Item(1).CodeModel;
  foreach (VCCodeInclude vcInclude in vcCM.Includes)
  {
    MessageBox.Show(vcInclude.DisplayName);
  }    
}
 Both give exception: "unable to cast com object of type 'system.__comobject' to interface type Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCCodeModel"
"unable to cast com object of type 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Project.VisualC.VCProjectEngine.VCProjectShim' to type Microsoft.VisualStudio.Project.VisualC.VCProjectEngine.VCProject"
 How can I set this up ? Preferably using the "project"... or application.SelectedItems... Is it possible ? Can somebody please give me an idea? Thank you.
@CODE:"application" EnvDTE.Project project = application.SelectedItems.Item(1).Project;
EnvDTE.Solution sol = (EnvDTE.Solution)application.Solution; VCProject vcProject = (VCProject)application.Solution.Projects.Item(1).Object;

 I would like to transform the xml to html5 but keep each chunk (xml:id) together. I want to avoid divits (overuse of divs) so wraping each p in a div is out, but I also am trying to avoid invalid HTML. for example it would be easy to take the parent p (xml:id=a-01) and wrap it aroud its descendants, however, a block level <div> and another <p> would be invalid, and the browser would intrepret everything after the end of the text as orphaned text. I have tried various modified XSLTs from my question from yesterday. However, I find myself in a bit of unfamiliar territory. I would also benefit a concise explanation of the solution so I can start to better understand XSLT, as it looks like I will be spending more time with it in the upcoming months. I should probably pick up book by Michael Kay or something. EDIT: current version of the XSLT I am working with note: I Haven't attempted the page breaks yet. Also, I cannot get the <meta> tag to close....oxygen 14 keeps complaining about that. <xsl:template match="/">

@CONTENT:I'm trying to get control of a recursive trigger over DB2 (v9.7), unfortunately IBM documentation doesn't mention a way to know at which level of recursion the current trigger call is in. I've found that there's this function on sql-server: trigger_nestlevel(), it basically does what I want (knowing the actual trigger recursive call level). so I would like to know if there is an equivalent function in DB2.

@TITLE:Problems with gdb 7.5.1 debugging executable built via g 4.7.2
@CONTENT:I've been updating my Mac toolchain in order to take advantage of C++11 features and eventually get pretty-print debugging of STL data structures. I used Homebrew to build the gcc 4.7.2 compiler. I've been able to recompile the source of my current project using this new compiler. However all versions of gdb that I've tried have various problems when setting breakpoints, viewing source code or viewing local variables. The version of gdb that I believe is installed as part of the Xcode command-line tools, version 6.3.50, has trouble displaying various template-based variables. I've also built and tried to use several other gdb versions (7.3.1, 7.4.1 & 7.5.1), but each gdb version has problems that make it difficult to impossible to set breakpoints, view source code and view variables. Specifically, these gdb versions don't know the source file or line number of functions defined in header files, breakpoints can't be set in these header-file functions, and many local variables have been "optimized out". Has anybody else experienced these problems, and if so have you been able to resolve them? Which versions should I be using in my toolchain in order to avoid these problems? For the record, my development is on a recent MBP running the latest Mountain Lion updates. My IDE is Eclipse Juno with CDT version 8.1.1. And, yes, I've code signed all versions of gdb that I've built and attempted to use. Thanks for any input, Bob

@TITLE:Optimal way to save order of jQueryUI sortable list with Meteor
@CONTENT:I need some guidance/suggestions for an optimal way to save the order of a sortable list that takes advantage of Meteor. The following is a scaled down version of what I'm trying to do. The application is a simple todo list. The end goal for the user is to sort their list where the data is picked up from the database. As the user sorts tasks, I would like to save the order of the tasks. I've implemented this application without Meteor using php/ajax calls using sortable's update event that would delete the entry in the database and replace it with what was currently in the DOM. I'm curious to know if there are a better ways to do this taking advantage of Meteor's capabilities. The following sample code is straight off of a live demo. HTML: <template name="todo_list">
    <div class="todo_list sortable">
       {{#each task}}
            <div class="task">
                <h1>{{title}}</h1>  
                {{description}} 
            </div>
        {{/each}}
    </div>
</template>
 JS(Without the Meteor.isServer that simply populates the database.): if (Meteor.isClient) {
     //Populate the template
     Template.todo_list.task = function () {
        return Tasks.find({});
     };

     //Add sortable functionality
     Template.todo_list.rendered = function () {
        $( ".sortable" ).sortable();
        $( ".sortable" ).disableSelection();
     };
}
 Sample data (Output of Tasks.find({})): [{
   title:"CSC209",
   description:"Assignment 3"
 },
 {
   title:"Laundry",
   description:"Whites"
 },
 {
   title:"Clean",

@TITLE:How to read all bytes from server using Indy Client in Delphi?
@CONTENT:I am using Indy client to read the message the server is sending to me (client). It sends 512 bytes of data to me in one go. This 512 bytes of data is composed of two datatypes (Word and String). For example, it sends Word of 2 bytes, then again Word of 2 bytes and then String of 50 bytes and so on. I am trying following code to cope with this problem: var BufferArray : Array[0..512] of Byte;

 if IdTCPClient1.IOHandler.InputBufferIsEmpty then
 begin
      if IdTCPClient1.IOHandler.CheckForDataOnSource(1000) then
      begin
          Edit1.Text := idtcpclient1.IOHandler.ReadBytes(BufferArray ,512, true);
      end;
 end;
 I am getting error on line Edit1.Text := idtcpclient1.IOHandler.ReadBytes(BufferArray ,512, true); Error: Type of actual and formal var parameter must be identical. Is it right approach I am using. I want to store whole 512 bytes on Edit1.Text and then will do whatever I want to do with that data. Please help me in getting all 512 bytes from the server. Update: Alternating Approach I am using this approach to read word and string values WordArray : array[0..5] of word;

 if IdTCPClient1.IOHandler.InputBufferIsEmpty then
 begin
      if IdTCPClient1.IOHandler.CheckForDataOnSource(1000) then
      begin
        i := 0;
        while i < 6 do //Read all the words
        begin
            //Fill WORD data in array
            WordArray[i] :=  (IdTCPClient1.Socket.ReadWord(True));
        end;
      end;
end;
 Similar approach for string like WordArray[i] := (IdTCPClient1.Socket.ReadString(50)); Thats working fine, but I have to remain the connection open while I read all the data in loop. If in between connection goes, I lose everything and have to request the whole package again from server.

@TITLE:Cannot open .mp4 video files using OpenCV 2.4.3, Python 2.7 in Windows 7 machine
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a project that involves reading mp4 video files. The problem I encountered is that it using Python 2.7 (32 bit), OpenCV 2.4.3 (cv2.pyd) in a Windows 7 machine. The code snippet is as follows: try:
        video = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4")
except:
        print "Could not open video file"
        raise
print video.grab()
 "video.grab()" always returns false: meaning it doesn't read the file "video.mp4" But when we try this: try:
        video = cv2.VideoCapture("video.avi")
except:
        print "Could not open video file"
        raise
print video.grab()
 "video.grab()" returns true: meaning it is able to read ".avi" files. Another is we have tried this same snippet on Linux and Mac and it seems to work fine, meaning it is able to read both mp4 files and avi files. This problem is similar to this problem and this problem. Both still don't have a clear and workable answer. I would appreciate any help or workaround aside from just using Linux or Mac for programming this as I need this to work on all three systems.

        video = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4")

@LINK:/questions/13830517/why-is-my-method-not-clearing-the-arraylist
@TITLE:Why is my method not clearing the ArrayList?
@CONTENT:NOTE: The problem with my code was simply that I created the method to clear the rects and everything but the only thing I was doing wrong was instantiating DrawPanel class's myDraw object inside of the go() method. And so I had to instantiate DrawPanel again with Stop and that created a whole new object. So I ended up calling the clearRects method on a different DrawPanel object than the one rects were being added to. Anyway, I decided to go with code suggestions by MadProgrammer because his code was exactly how Java: A Beginner's Guide teaches it and was much cleaner. Well, I have been running around StackOverflow since this morning and have been able to fix a lot of problems with my code but I am still stuck with this problem with ArrayLists. I have the following piece of code that does not seem to do what I intend for it to do. Now I am aware that I am the one making a mistake somewhere but not really sure how to correct it. The way it is set up is that when I hit the stop button, the ArrayList should clear so I have a blank JPanel so to speak, here's the code snippets. I can post the whole program if you want me to though but I am only pasting the snippet here because I'm assuming I'm making a pretty simple and dumb mistake on my part: class DrawPanel extends JPanel {
    ArrayList<MyRectangle> rects = new ArrayList<>();
    Random rand = new Random();

    @Override
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {

        super.paintComponent(g);

        addRect();

        for(MyRectangle r : rects) {
        g.setColor(r.getColor());
        g.fillRect(r.x, r.y, r.width, r.height);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
        return new Dimension(500,500);
    }

    public ArrayList<MyRectangle> addRect() {
        int ht = rand.nextInt(getHeight());
    int wd = rand.nextInt(getWidth());

    int x = rand.nextInt(getWidth() - wd);
    int y = rand.nextInt(getHeight() - ht);

    int r = rand.nextInt(256);

        rects.clear();
        frame.repaint();
        System.out.println("I was called");
    }
}
 And here's the part where the button calls it in its actionPerformed method: class StopListener implements ActionListener {
    DrawPanel draw = new DrawPanel();
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        timer.stop();
        draw.clearEvent(e);
    }
    }
 EDIT: I understand that the arraylist object that my clearEvent method refers to is not the same one that addRect()'s adding stuff to. What I am asking, I guess, is how to make it "connect" so I can wipe things clean using the JButton. EDIT: Here's the full program: import javax.swing.*;

@TITLE:Scaling a JavaEE application to 1.000.000 concurrent users
@CONTENT:I have a JavaEE application: 1 EAR using EJB and SOAP; some WARs using Servlets. Currently the EAR is deployed in Glassfish 3.1.2 (community edition) and the WARs either in tomcat or also on the Glassfish server. The app is backed by a MySQL database and mostly does some trivial data massaging in and out of the database. There is virtually no static content. In the current architecture, virtually no requests can be answered by a war itself and always involve the EAR (it might be possible to change this with some re-engineering). This works out of the box for 20 concurrent users and with some http thread pool tweaking for up to 200 concurrent users on a medium sized server. I now have to scale the application to cope with 1.000.000 users (this is not an optimistic guess but a realistic requirement for the business; most of the 'users' will be devices deployed in the field). How do I scale this application to deal with 1.000.000 concurrent users? Especially: Should I be able to get more than 200-500 users served by a single glassfish server (for a not too demanding webapp)? If yes, what should I aim for? glassfish clusters seem to be an option, but how far does that scale? Even then, running 1000-2000 servers (even in the cloud) does not really sound appealing to me. If tomcat/glassfish is the wrong answer, what are the alternatives? Currently the bottleneck is the webapp, but I assume at some stage the DB might become an issue too. How well does MySQL scale to such size?

@TITLE:Creating a function in Postgresql that does not return composite values
@CONTENT:I'm learning how to write functions in Postgresql. I've defined a function called _tmp_myfunction() which takes in an id and returns a table (I also define a table object type called _tmp_mytable) -- create object type to be returned
CREATE TYPE _tmp_mytable AS (
    id      integer, 
    cost    double precision
    );

-- create function which returns query
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _tmp_myfunction(
    id    integer
    )
RETURNS SETOF _tmp_mytable AS $$
BEGIN  
  RETURN QUERY 
  SELECT
    sales.gid,
    cost  
  FROM 
    sales
  WHERE
    id = sales.gid;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
 This works fine when I use one id and call it using the following approach: SELECT * FROM _tmp_myfunction(402);
 What I would like to be able to do is to call it, but to use a column of values instead of just one value. However, if I use the following approach I end up with all values of the table in one column, separated by commas: -- call function using all values in a column
SELECT _tmp_myfunction(t.id)
FROM transactions as t;
 I understand that I can get the same result if I use SELECT _tmp_myfunction(402); instead of SELECT * FROM _tmp_myfunction(402); but I don't know how to construct my function in such a way that I do not get composite values when I pass in a column of values.
@CODE:_tmp_myfunction() id _tmp_mytable -- create object type to be returned
CREATE TYPE _tmp_mytable AS (
    id      integer, 
    cost    double precision

@LINK:/questions/13809917/are-directly-assigned-event-handlers-actual-object-properties
@TITLE:Are directly assigned event handlers actual object properties?
@CONTENT:I got stuck trying to answer this question: Explaining odd behavior in javascript. While researching, I found that event handlers assigned directly to host objects present a strange behavior: they can be accessed as properties of the object, but somehow they don't appear to be actual properties. For example, if I define a variable on the global scope, it looks like any other property of window: ?var foo = "foo";
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window, 'foo'));
// Object {value: "foo", writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: false} 
 I get the same output if I just assign to window.foo, or if I create an implied global (but then [[Configurable]] would be true, for known reasons; and, of course, that wouldn't work on strict mode). However, if I try to add an event handler by assigning to window.onsomething, I can't read that property with Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor (although it's still accessible under window.onsomething): window.onresize = function onresize(e) {
    console.log('rsz', e);
}
console.log(window.onresize); // function onresize(){...}
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window, 'onresize')); // undefined
 How do browsers deal with event handlers assigned like that? I suspect the answer to this is also the answer to that other question.
@CODE:window ?var foo = "foo";
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window, 'foo'));
// Object {value: "foo", writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: false} window.foo true window.onsomething Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor window.onsomething window.onresize = function onresize(e) {
    console.log('rsz', e);
}
console.log(window.onresize); // function onresize(){...}
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window, 'onresize')); // undefined

I already have solution that seems to be working: self.start_low_priority =  ('cmd', '/c', 'start', '/MIN', '/LOW', '/B', '/WAIT')

@CONTENT:I used Eclipse to create a new plug-in project which created a default Activator for me.

Following the guide on what to do when your bundle isn't visible in Eclipse I stumbled upon the following results. Using the ss command, I can see my bundle listed. The status of my bundle is 'Starting' The bundle is in the process of starting. A bundle is in the STARTING state when its start method is active. A bundle must be in this state when the bundle's BundleActivator.start(BundleContext) is called. If the BundleActivator.start method completes without exception, then the bundle has successfully started and must move to the ACTIVE state. A breakpoint placed on the first line in the start method doesn't get hit. Neither does System.out.println show up in the console. What could cause the start method not getting called, and thus the state being stuck in STARTING?

    List() { mSize = 0; }

    const T* begin() const { return mItems; }

}
 I get this error: error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'const int *' to 'int *'

 This usage doesn't complain: List< int, 5 > myInts;

@CONTENT:I have a JSON string which includes a function I need to call. My JSON looks like this: {

    content = dyn.content;
 I had hoped calling it would trigger the function but it just returns the function name as a string. Question: How can trigger the actual function? Thanks! EDIT: I'm putting the JSON string on the HTML element on the actual page, which I will replace with the element I'm building. Here is the HTML: <ul data-template="true" data-config='{

 I could put all of these into data- attributes, but that would be messy... Solution: This worked: 1) change JSON to: ..."method":"getRetailers", ...
 2) call from Javascript: content = dynoData[ dyn.method ]();

@LINK:/questions/13782923/rails-cant-find-the-module-if-config-cache-classes-true
@TITLE:Rails can't find the module, if config.cache_classes = true
@CONTENT:I have a gem which is mounted as engine in my rails app via routes.rb & Gemfile. Here are the important pieces: Apps' Gemfile source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.2.9'
gem 'mysql2'


group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails'
  gem 'coffee-rails'
end
gem 'jquery-rails'
gem "common_client", path: "../common-client"
 App's routes.rb mount CommonClient::Engine => "", :as => 'shared'
 gem's routes.rb get '/register' => 'session#new_registration'
 gems's SessionController require 'common_client/session_controller_base'

class SessionController < ApplicationController

  include CommonClient::SessionControllerBase
end
 gems's SessionControllerBase module CommonClient

  module SessionControllerBase

  def new_registration
      #some code goes here
  end
end
 This works just fine in development & rails is able to find CommonClient::SessionController & execute new_registration action whenever visitor hits /register route. But in Production, rails is unable to find CommonClient::SessionController & generates the following error: $ RAILS_ENV=production rails s

 Now, here is the interesting part. These errors goes away in production & app works just fine when I disable code caching in production.rb. by setting config.cache_classes = false
 All this makes me wonder, why rails can CommonClient::SessionController in development env but not in production env? How does setting config.cache_classes = false makes it work in production? And rails can find CommonClient::SessionController which it was not able to do earlier What I need to do when so that rails finds CommonClient::SessionController other than ugly hack of disabling code cache & reloading all code on each request? Lastly, I have tried to explain as best I could but still something is not clear or more information is required. Please leave a comment. Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm new to Scala, and have been trying to use its excellent combinator parser library. I've been trying to get this code to compile: import scala.util.parsing.combinator._
...
val r:Parsers#ParseResult[Node] = parser.parseAll(parser.suite,reader)
r match {
  case Success(r, n) => println(r)
  case Failure(msg, n) => println(msg)
  case Error(msg, n) => println(msg)
}
...
 But I keep getting these errors: TowelParser.scala:97: error: not found: value Success
  case Success(r, n) => println(r)
       ^
TowelParser.scala:98: error: not found: value Failure
  case Failure(msg, n) => println(msg)

TowelParser.scala:99: error: object Error is not a case class constructor, nor does it have an unapply/unapplySeq method
  case Error(msg, n) => println(msg)
 I've tried lots of different things like: case Parsers#Success(r, n) => println(r)
 and case Parsers.Success(r, n) => println(r)
 and import scala.util.parsing.combinator.Parsers.Success
 But I can't seem to get this to compile. I'm sure there's probably something obvious I'm missing, but I've been at it for a while, and google doesn't seem to have any good examples of this. Thanks!

@TITLE:Scala and Python's pass
@CONTENT:I was wondering, is there an equivalent of python's pass expression? The idea is to write method signatures without implementations and compiling them just to type-check those signatures for some library prototyping. I was able to kind of simulate such behavior using this: def pass[A]:A = {throw new Exception("pass"); (new Object()).asInstanceOf[A]}
 now when i write: def foo():Int = bar()
def bar() = pass[Int]
 it works(it typechecks but runtime explodes, which is fine), but my implementation doesn't feel right (for example the usage of java.lang.Object()). Is there better way to simulate such behavior?

@TITLE:How to prevent having to update all implementing classes after updating an interface?
@CONTENT:We have a WPF application which is primarily a charting application. There are approximately 30 charts. Each chart has its own table in a database which holds configuration information for the chart. Each chart has an class in the app containing configuration information related to the chart. We have an interface in our app (IChartConfiguration) which each chart configuration class implements. It allows the app to work with any particular chart configuration in a consistent and similar manner. The 'problem' we have is that each time we need to add a property to the interface, for a new chart that adds a new configuration property we haven't already dealt with, we have to go back to each chart configuration class, that doesn't already have this new property implemented (most of them usually) and add it. to satisfy the interface implementation. This isn't a huge burden, but it seems to me there must be a better way to deal with this. Is there a better way to handle this?

@TITLE:Symfony2 get user id in entity repository
@CONTENT:I have coded a page which displays all administrators of the system. What I want to do is customize my query so that it would exclude the currently authenticated user from the list. Now I know I can get the user_id from the controller and pass it to the entity repository, but I was wondering if there is a way to access that directly through the Entity Repository? For example: use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;
use Doctrine\ORM\NoResultException;

use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserProviderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\UsernameNotFoundException;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\UnsupportedUserException;

class AdminUserRepository extends EntityRepository implements UserProviderInterface
{
   public function getAdmins($int = 10, $offset = 0, array $orderBy = array('admin_id', 'asc')){
        $admin_id = fetch the admin id ?;
        $query = $this->createQueryBuilder('admins')
            ->where("admins.admin_id != '".$admin_id."'")
            ->orderBy('admins.'.$orderBy[0], $orderBy[1])
            ->setFirstResult($offset)
            ->setMaxResults($int)
            ->getQuery()
            ->getResult();
        return $query;
   }
}

@TITLE:backbone.js routing when query passed to route contains /
@CONTENT:My app basically takes some form input and returns a set of results. I have two routes routes: {
        '': 'search',
        'search': 'search',
        'results/:query': 'results'
    },
    results: function(query) {
        var search = new ResultsSearchView();
        var grid = new GridView({ query: query });
    }
 If the query contains any characters / specifically (can totally happen in this case), they are added to the URL and my route breaks. I have tried using encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent() bit I'm not having any luck. How are you folks handling such things?
@CODE:routes: {
        '': 'search',
        'search': 'search',

@TITLE:Chrome says: Resource interpreted as Stylesheet but transferred with MIME type application/xml
@CONTENT:I have an XML file which is styled using an XSL file. When opening the XML file in Firefox, I get no problems, (although strangely, sometimes it will only display after I hit "reload"), but in Chrome/Chromium I get the error message: Resource interpreted as Stylesheet but transferred with MIME type application/xml
 The files are up here: http://jonreeve.com/test/mike/biblexml.xml I don't think there's anything irregular about the XML/XSL syntax, and the links all seem to be worded correctly, too. Furthermore, this doesn't seem to be similar to all the similar-looking questions here, which seem to be dealing with javascript and other applications. This one is just pure XML/XSL.

@TITLE:Algorithm for evaluating nested logical expression
@CONTENT:I have a logical expression that I would like to evaluate. The expression can be nested and consists of T (True) or F (False) and parenthesis. The parenthesis "(" means "logical OR". Two terms TF beside each others (or any other two combinations beside each others), should be ANDED (Logical AND). For example, the expression: ((TFT)T) = true
 I need an algorithm for solving this problem. I thought of converting the expression first to disjunctive or conjunctive normal form and then I can easily evaluate the expression. However, I couldn't find an algorithm that normalizes the expression. Any suggestions? Thank you. The problem statement can be found here: https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=2&category=378&page=show_problem&problem=2967 Edit: I misunderstood part of the problem. In the given logical expression, the AND/OR operators alternate with every parenthesis "(". If we are to represent the expression by a tree, then the AND/OR operators depend on the the sub-tree's depth-level. However, it's initially given that the trees at the deepest level are AND-trees. My task is to evaluate the given expression possibly by constructing the tree. Thanks for the answers below which clarified the correct requirement of the problem.

@TITLE:YAML::load raises undefined class/module error
@CONTENT:Im implementing paper trail like feature in my rails app. In order to do this, Im serializing object in YAML. Ive got item_at_version method, which basically does YAML::load(cached_object) V this works pretty well, however, I have no idea why, sometimes it returns undefined class/module _class name_. It works with models like Event, Conversation, Note, and many more, but without any reason, it seems to throw that error for models like Dataset, Comment, Student (Ive tried to find any pattern for that, without any luck). Im using rails 3.2.8, ruby 1.9.3p327, psych as YAML Engine (Psych::Version returns 1.3.4). Ps. When I add require 'model_name' on top of that file, it works like a charm. Any ideas what should I change/add to get this working? Edit: Theres no much code which I can share: def item_at_version
  YAML::load(cached_object)
end

@TITLE:WCF service exposing 2 endpoints on 2 different service contracts
@CONTENT:I have an WCF service which I am trying to configure so that it exposes 2 endpoints, refering to different functionalities, under different URLs. What I want to have is Service1, exposing methods A, B, C, and Service2, exposing methods D, E. I want to be able to browse both localhost/WebServiceName/Service1/Service.svc and localhost/WebServiceName/Service2/Service.svc. Other applications referencing localhost/WebServiceName/Service1/Service.svc should see only the interface containing the methods A, B and C. They should not see anything regarding Service2 interface. And for Service2 likewise. So far I have defined two interfaces in my WCF service, I_Service1 and I_Service2. I have added two endpoints in my web.config like so: <endpoint address="http://localhost/WebServiceName/Service1/" binding="wsHttpBinding" contract="WebServiceName.I_Service1" bindingConfiguration="Binding1" />
<endpoint address="http://localhost/WebServiceName/Service2/" binding="wsHttpBinding" contract="WebServiceName.I_Service2" bindingConfiguration="Binding2" />  
 The suggestion of using full address in the enpoint comes from here: Multiple endpoints under IIS But still, I can't browse localhost/WebServiceName/Service1/Service.svc. I receive: Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.

@TITLE:Different authentication mode for different areas
@CONTENT:I have two portions of a website I am working on: one that uses normal forms authentication and another that uses an HMAC-based authentication. The forms based one works just as normal (except using a custom membership provider). The most frustrating thing is that by default, if one decides to use the forms authentication it redirects all 401 responses to the loginUrl specified in the root Web.config under the authentication tag. In an effort to turn this off for the HMAC portion of my site I have created a separate area that those controllers live in. However, no matter where I put a <authentication mode="None"></authentication> tag (whether it be in the area/views Web.config, a Web.config I have placed in the area folder, or under a location tag in the root Web.config (doing that actually causes an error about that tag not belonging there)) I cannot seem to make this thing stop redirecting all 401s to the loginUrl. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated as this is making me tear my hair out. By the way, this question has been asked different ways at least 2 times with no (viable) responses. While mine focuses on setting the authentication mode to None,theirs generally focused on changing roles for paths (which in my opinion is easier to do with the [Authorize(Roles="role1,role2,role3")] attribute on each method) which makes my question a little different. If this is impossible, please also tell me so that I can figure out a better way to do this.

No one area of the site seems to cause it to occur any more than another. The issue is quite similar to the question asked here: Ninject + "Error loading Ninject component ICache". However, the issue in that question seems to be caused by a bug with the extension itself, is over a year old, and looks to have been resolved. This occurs without any modification to the NinjectWebCommon.cs file, whatsoever. (No modules loaded, no bindings added.) The only way for me to get it to stop is to exclude NinjectWebCommon.cs from the project, altogether. I'm not sure what other information to include, as I've done little other than install the Nuget packages. Perhaps worth noting is that this project does include references to other assemblies that utilize Ninject for DI. I've looked around quite a bit and am at a loss for why this would occur. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:How to find inadvertent object pointer comparisons?
@CONTENT:Quick question - Is there a good way to find uses of == with objects instead of isEqual:? Full story: I had a bunch of code kind of like this: typedef long DataKey;

DataKey x;
DataKey y;

if (x == y) {
    // do stuff
}
 I now have a need to replace using a long for my DataKey with an object. After creating the class and doing a bunch of global search and replace, my code now is kind of like this: @interface DataKey : NSObject

DataKey *x;
DataKey *y;

if (x == y) { // uh-oh - this is now bad
    // do stuff
}
 Is there a warning I can enable in the compiler that warns about using the scalar operators in pointers? I'm using Xcode 4.5.2 with the LLVM 4.1 compiler. I haven't been able to find one. Any other suggestions to help fix all of this code? This is not a trivial code base. There are hundreds of source files to deal with. This is a major refactoring effort. Edit: It would be great if there was a warning much like when you use assignment in an if condition instead of comparison. You can get a warning for this and use parenthesis to stop the warning. Update: Based on a suggestion in the comments, I added the -Weverything compiler option to a test project. This did not produce any desired result when comparing two object pointers with ==. Perhaps a combination of C++, overloading the operator== method, and getting some compiler warning/error when trying to use that operator can be achieved. I may post another question focused on this option.
@CODE:== isEqual: typedef long DataKey;

DataKey x;
DataKey y;

if (x == y) {
    // do stuff
} long DataKey @interface DataKey : NSObject

DataKey *x;
DataKey *y;

if (x == y) { // uh-oh - this is now bad
    // do stuff

 I want to build a dirset that includes all directories older than 2012-12-01. If I am reading right, the selector can be used to limit the files returned. But it appears this doesn't work for a dirset, even though the dirset documentation says you can use nested patternsets and selectors. If I use the date selector on a fileset, I get just the one old file that I would expect; but with the same syntax on a dirset, I get all directories: <fileset id="old.files" dir="mydir">
  <date datetime="12/01/2012 12:00 AM" when="before"/>
</fileset>
<echo message="Files: ${toString:old.files}"/>

@TITLE:Passing DataTable to IronPython
@CONTENT:I have a .NET project where I am using IronPython to perform some processing of the data. At present, the C# code loops through and generates an IronPython script for each row and column that requires dynamic calculation. However, I'd like to make the process more efficient by passing in the DataTable object and a script to execute against it. Unfortunately, I'm getting 'DataTable' object is unsubscriptable error and no processing takes place. C# snippet to generate and execute IronPython script: DataTable dt = new DataTable();
dt.Columns.Add("count", typeof(int));
dt.Columns.Add("calc", typeof(int));
dt.Rows.Add(1, null);

ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine(options);
ScriptScope scope = engine.CreateScope();
scope.SetVariable("dt", dt);
ScriptSource source = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromString(code, SourceCodeKind.AutoDetect);
object result = source.Execute(scope);
DataTable table = scope.GetVariable<System.Data.DataTable>("dt");
 Python script to be executed against the table: import clr
clr.AddReference('System.Data')
from System import Data
from System.Data import DataTable
for row in dt.Rows:
    dt["calc"] = dt["count"] + 1
 How do I fix the 'DataTable' object is unsubscriptable error, or is there a better way to handle passing a DataTable into IronPython?

@TITLE:Ruby - Calling setters from within an object
@CONTENT:I've been working through the Pragmatic Programmers 'Programming Ruby' book and was wondering if it was possible to call a setter method within a class rather than just assigning to the instance variable directly. class BookInStock

  attr_reader :isbn, :price

  def initialize (isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end

  def price_in_cents
    Integer(price*100 + 0.5)
  end

  def price_in_cents=(cents)
    @price = cents/100.0
  end

  def price=(dollars)
    price = dollars if dollars > 0
  end

end
 In this case I am using a setter to ensure that the price can't be negative. What i want to know is if it is possible to call the price setter from within the price_in_cents setter so that I wont have to write extra code to ensure that the price will be positive. Thanks in advance
@CODE:class BookInStock

  attr_reader :isbn, :price

  def initialize (isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end

  def price_in_cents

  end

  def price_in_cents=(cents)
    @price = cents/100.0
  end

@CONTENT:I am writing code to perform Gaussian integration with n points, where n is a compile time constant. For a given n, I know how to compute abscissas and weights. The computation has to be done from scratch for each different n. Now, I do something along these lines: // Several structs like this one (laguerre, chebyshev, etc).

    return acc;
}
 to be used like this: double i = gauss_quadrature<legendre<12>> (f);
 Now, I can specialize in a translation unit the coefficients for legendre<12>, by doing template <>
const legendre<12>::x[12] = { ... };

template <>
const legendre<12>::w[12] = { ... };
 and everything is fine, as long as I only use 12-points Gauss-Legendre. Now, I'm experimenting with different number of points, and I know how to generate the weights and nodes. I can for instance provide a routine void compute_legendre_coeffs (size_t n, double* w, double* x);
 and : When I call gauss_quadrature<legendre<n>>, the template legendre<n> is automatically instantiated (this is the case). When legendre<n> is instantiated for some compile-time n, I'd like the above compute_legendre_coeffs to be called at some point before main so that it fills the x and w member arrays. How do I achieve this ? I know must define the arrays first: template <size_t n>
const double legendre<n>::x[n] = {};

template <size_t n>
const double legendre<n>::w[n] = {};
 but I can't come up with a method to initialize them. Anyone has a trick to do so ?

The following code works perfectly using a submit button, posting back the selected id's as an array of id's, but I need to have this on a page with other buttons. // the view 
@foreach (var station in Stations)
{
   <input type="checkbox" name="selected" value="@station.StationId" /> 
}    
<input type="submit" value="Save" />

//Controller stub
public ActionResult Action(string [] selected) 
 I have been stuck on this for hours, so maybe I am looking at this the wrong way. PS. My first post after many many hours reading and learning here.
@CODE:// the view 
@foreach (var station in Stations)
{
   <input type="checkbox" name="selected" value="@station.StationId" /> 
}    
<input type="submit" value="Save" />

@TITLE:Writeable and Executable location on Android
@CONTENT:I've compiled a binary using the Android NDK toolchain, and am attempting to deploy it to a device. An application which has been built with the NDK using JNI will then execute this binary via native code. I'm hoping to avoid rooting the device. The binary will be used by multiple applications, so I'd like to store it in a shared location, rather than once per application. I can't find an appropriate location to deploy this binary to - these are the places I've tried: /mnt/sdcard - using getExternalStoragePublicDirectory() from the SDK, however the SD card is mounted as noexec, meaning I can't run it. /system/bin - read-only file system, so can't copy. I can push the file using adb push if I remount /system on the emulator using: mount -o rw,remount -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtd3 /system
 However I'd like to avoid this, as the device would need to be rooted. /data/local - using adb push, I can push the binary to this location. However, I can't seem to find a way to do this in code (using the Android SDK). The internal storage mechanism points to /data/data/package. I've compiled native code which calls this executable, using arm-linux-androideabi-g++ shipped with the NDK toolchain. This works with the binary in /system/bin and /data/local. In summary, I'm looking for a location in the Android file system to which I can copy a file from the project /assets folder, which world-executable permissions are possible.

 When the device is rotated to landscape on this view controller, I present a modal view controller. When the device is rotated back to portrait, I am supposed to dismiss the modal view, but when I do I get the following error: 'preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation must return a supported interface orientation!'
 Why am I getting this error? I tried returning YES from shouldAutorotate in the root UIViewController, and now I get the error 'Supported orientations has no common orientation with the application, and shouldAutorotate is returning YES'. This makes no sense to my, because UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait is one of the applications supported orientations.

@CONTENT:I'm aware that exception trapping can be expensive, but I'm wondering if there are cases when it's actually less expensive than a lookup? For example, if I have a large dictionary, I could either test for the existence of a key: If MyDictionary.ContainsKey(MyKey) Then _
  MyValue = MyDictionary(MyKey) ' This is 2 lookups just to get the value.
 Or, I could catch an exception: Try
  MyValue = MyDictionary(MyKey) ' Only doing 1 lookup now.
Catch(e As Exception)
  ' Didn't find it.
End Try
 Is exception trapping always more expensive than lookups like the above, or is it less so in some circumstances?

@TITLE:Is there a jQuery way of iterating over an objects own properties only?
@CONTENT:I'm making a small jQuery-like library, and one thing striking me odd is the behavior of $.each. In javascript we have a for...in loop: for (var key in obj) {
    console.log(key + ': ' + obj[key]);
}
 The problem with this, is that it will iterate over inherited properties as well, that is, properties coming from the object constructor's prototype. One can know this using hasOwnProperty, for example. And jQuery could do that. But, when you pass an object to $.each, it behaves exactly like a for...in, iterating over inherited properties as well. It also should be marginally slower, and requires a few more characters to type. Check this fiddle to see it in action and look here for the source code of $.each. So my question is, is there an object iteration method in jQuery that only includes own properties? If not, should a library behave like this? Edit: Since jQuery does not do this, you can also answer if this is useful. I mean, I cannot see myself wanting to iterate over prototype properties, but maybe I'm missing something.
@CODE:$.each for...in for (var key in obj) {
    console.log(key + ': ' + obj[key]);
} hasOwnProperty $.each for...in $.each hasOwnProperty Object.keys() getOwnPropertyNames for in var key for (var key in obj) key hasOwnProperty var has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; has.call({abc: 'xyz'}, 'abc');

@TITLE:Generate unique random strings
@CONTENT:I am writing a very small URL shortener with Dancer. It uses the REST plugin to store a posted URL in a database with a six character string which is used by the user to access the shorted URL. Now I am a bit unsure about my random string generation method. sub generate_random_string{
    my $length_of_randomstring = shift; # the length of 
                                        # the random string to generate

        # rand @chars will generate a random

    # Start over if the string is already in the Database
    generate_random_string(6) if database->quick_select('urls', { shortcut => $random_string });

    return $random_string;
}
 This generates a six char string and calls the function recursively if the generated string is already in the DB. I know there are 63^6 possible strings but this will take some time if the database gathers more entries. And maybe it will become a nearly infinite recursion, which I want to prevent. Are there ways to generate unique random strings, which prevent recursion? Thanks in advance
@CODE:sub generate_random_string{
    my $length_of_randomstring = shift; # the length of

@TITLE:Parsing function / method content using Reflection
@CONTENT:My unit testing frameworks consists of TestFixtures, TestMethods and Actions. Action is additional smaller container inside TestMethod, Actions comes from internal Dll written in our company. Actions are used inside methods like that: [Test]
void TestMethod1()
{
    Run(new Sleep { Seconds = 10 } );
}
 I have to write an application, which collect all the information about fixtures, tests and actions from DLL. I have found how to enumerate test fixtures and test methods by reflection using type / method attributes. But I have no idea how enumerate actions inside test methods. Could you please help? Is it possible to do using reflection at all? UPDATED: See the accepted answer. Really cool library. Also you can look here ( WPF: Binding TreeView in MVVM way step by step tutorial ), if you are interested in how I created entity model for fixtures, tests and actions, and binded in MVVM way to TreeView.

@LINK:/questions/13674201/dotall-and-multiline-regex
@TITLE:DotAll and multiline RegEx
@CONTENT:i got a little trouble using Rexex in Powershell. It seems like there is a imlementation error or something. The text i want to work with is a html file, which looks like this (Example1): <span>[Mobile: %mobile% |] Phone: %telephone% [| Fax: %faxNumber%]</span>
<Span>
 The Problem is that, caused by html editors, i also may get something like this (Example2): <span>[Mobile: 

%mobile% |] Phone: %telephone% [| Fax: &nbsp;&nbsp;%faxNumber%]</span>
 So as you see, we got linebreaks and html escaped, fixed whitespaces &nbsp;. My Powershell Regex looks like this: $x = $x -ireplace '(?ms)\[(.?){7}Fax(.*?)\]', 'MyReplacement1'
 and this $x = $x -ireplace '(?ms)\[(.?){7}Mobile(.*?)\]', 'MyReplacement2'
 Basicly The [ marks the beginning of a variable and ] the end of it. Two problems arise from this: Since we got two variables, mobile and fax, i'm using (.?){7} to allow SOME (here exacly 7) characters and avoid matching the hole part between the first [ near Mobile and the last ] near Fax (which would happen if i would be using (.*?) instead of (.?){7}). I'm not sure if there are alternatives so that i can allow ANY number (and not 7) of chars between the starting [ and the variable keyword "Fax" for example. This would be usefull to avoid missmatches when stuff like &nbsp;&nbsp; gets added (where only 7 char would not be enough and like i said (.*?) will fail). Hope i was able to explain it (kinda hard) - if not: please feel free to ask! Powershells -replace method dosn't offer a way to set regex options, therefore i got to use (?ms) to set DotAll and multiline modes. As you see, I'm using it within my regex pattern. However: when a newline is added, as you see in example2 between the words Mobile: and %mobile%, the regex fails and nothing gets replaced! I'm greatfull for any help and even regex recommandations from the pros to avoid any further problems i'm not thinking about right now... EDIT: (Example3): <span>[Mobile: 

%mobile% |] Phone: %telephone% [| Fax: 
%faxNumber%]</span>
@CODE:<span>[Mobile: %mobile% |] Phone: %telephone% [| Fax: %faxNumber%]</span>

@TITLE:local storage on window unload event
@CONTENT:I'm using local storage to store some data: the user makes ajax requests to get information and I'm storing the result in storage so that next time he requests the same info, I first look in storage to see if it's there. Now I'm realizing it's actually more efficient to keep that data in an object in memory, and loop over that when needed, rather then loop over local storage. So as I'm moving some data from local storage to an in-memory object, I'm wondering if the window.unload event can be reliably used to write the content of that cache object to local storage on disk, and then retrieve it back using the onload event? Thanks.

@TITLE:shallow copy - new instance Or assignment
@CONTENT:Shallow copy means a "copy" of an object with same values of their attributes whether primitive or reference values. While performing shallow copy is it necessary to "create a new instance" ? as: public class A {
    int aValue;
    B bObj;

    ...

    public A createShallow(A a1Obj) {
        A aObj = new A();
        aObj.aValue = a1Obj.aValue;
        aObj.bObj = a1Obj.bObj;

        return aObj;
    }
}
 Or copy by assignment is also considered as shallow copy: B b = new B(10);
A a = new A(1, b);

A a1 = a;
 This article at wikipedia defines shallow copy as reference variables sharing same memory block. So according to this copy by assignment will also be a shallow copy. But is not it a variables pointing to same object instead of "copy" of an Object ?
@CODE:public class A {
    int aValue;
    B bObj;

    ...

    public A createShallow(A a1Obj) {
        A aObj = new A();

@TITLE:Adding and retrieving embedded resources codedom
@CONTENT:Ok, I feel like the answer to my question is online, but I cannot find it. All I'm trying to do is add a text resource file to the program I'm compiling with CodeDom and then access that text file in the compiled program. To add the embedded resource, I used the following code:         System.Resources.ResourceWriter writer = new System.Resources.ResourceWriter("Resources.resx");
        writer.AddResource("EoS.txt", Form1.MasterEncoder.GetBytes(Properties.Resources.Eos));
        writer.Generate();
        writer.Close();
        Parameters.EmbeddedResources.Add("Resources.resx");
 Here "Parameters" is my compiler parameters object and "Eos.txt" is the file I'm trying to write, which is a resource in the application. This doesn't throw any errors when I build the program, but when I try to grab this text file in the newly compiled program using this code, which I added to the form load event:          _assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
         _textStreamReader = new StreamReader(_assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("Resources.EoS.txt"));
         TextFile = _textStreamReader.ReadToEnd();
 I get this error roughly: "Value cannot be null Parameter name: stream." I've tried changing "Resources" to the namespace of the program and many other little tweaks and nothing has worked. I'm not sure if I'm on the completely wrong track or not, but I think my issue is with CodeDom. Any suggestions?
@CODE:System.Resources.ResourceWriter writer = new System.Resources.ResourceWriter("Resources.resx");

@TITLE:Python truncating international string
@CONTENT:I've been trying to debug this for far too long, and I obviously have no idea what I'm doing, so hopefully someone can help. I'm not even sure what I should be asking, but here it goes: I'm trying to send Apple Push Notifications, and they have a payload size limit of 256 bytes. So subtract some overhead stuff, and I'm left with about 100 english characters of main message content. So if a message is longer than the max, I truncate it: MAX_PUSH_LENGTH = 100
body = (body[:MAX_PUSH_LENGTH]) if len(body) > MAX_PUSH_LENGTH else body
 So that's fine and dandy, and no matter how long of a message I have (in english), the push notification sends successfully. However, now I have an Arabic string: str = "??? ????? 
??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? 
??? ????? ??? ??? ??? 
???? ?"

>>> print len(str)
109
 So that should truncate. But, I always get an invalid payload size error! Curious, I kept lowering the MAX_PUSH_LENGTH threshold to see what it would take for it to succeed, and it's not until I set the limit to around 60 that the push notification succeeded. I'm not exactly sure if this has something to do with the byte size of languages other than english. It is my understanding that an English character takes one byte, so does an Arabic character take 2 bytes? Might this have something to do with it? Also, the string is JSON encoded before it is sent off, so it ends up looking something like this: \u0647\u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0646\u0643\u0648\u0646 \n\u0639\u064a\u0634 ... Could it be that it is being interpreted as a raw string, and just u0647 is 5 bytes? What should I be doing here? Are there any obvious errors or am I not asking the right question?
@CODE:MAX_PUSH_LENGTH = 100
body = (body[:MAX_PUSH_LENGTH]) if len(body) > MAX_PUSH_LENGTH else body str = "??? ?????

@TITLE:Strange compilation behaviour when calling a template method from another template object
@CONTENT:Could someone explain why the following c++ code is not behaving as expected: struct Object {   
  template< int i >
  void foo(){ } 
};

template<int counter>
struct Container {
  Object v[counter];

  void test(){
    // this works as expected
    Object a; a.foo<1>();

    // This works as well:
    Object *b = new Object(); b->foo<1>();

    // now try the same thing with the array:  
    v[0] = Object(); // that's fine (just testing access to the array)

# if defined BUG1
    v[0].foo<1>();   // compilation fails 
# elif defined BUG2
    (v[0]).foo<1>(); // compilation fails
# elif defined BUG3
    auto &o = v[0];
    o.foo<1>();      // compilation fails
# else
    Object &o = v[0];
    o.foo<1>();      // works
# endif
  }
};

int main(){
  Container<10> container;
}
 The code above compiles fine without flag. If one of the flag BUG1 to BUG3 is set, the compilation fails with either GCC 4.6 or 4.7 and with clang 3.2 (which seems to indicate it is not a GCC bug). Lines 21 to 29 are doing exactly the same thing semantically (ie calling a method of the first element of the Object array), but only the last version compiles. The problem only seems to arise when I try to call a templated method from a template object. BUG1 is just the "normal" way of writing the call. BUG2 is the same thing, but the array access is protected by parenthesis in case there was a precedence problem (but there shouldn't be any). BUG3 shows that type inference is not working either (needs to be compiled with c++11 support). The last version works fine, but I don't understand why using a temporary variable to store the reference solves the problem. I am curious to know why the other three are not valid. Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm programming a simple calculator in Bison & Flex , using C/C++ (The logic is done in Bison , and the C/C++ part is responsible for the data structures , e.g. STL and more) . I have the following problem : In my calculator the dollar sign $ means i++ and ++i (both prefix and postfix) , e.g. : int y = 3;
-> $y = 4
-> y$ = 4
 When the user hits : int_expression1 && int_expression2 , if int_expression1 is evaluated to 0 (i.e. false) , then I don't wan't bison to evaluate int_expression2 ! For example : int a = 0 ; 
int x = 2 ;
 and the user hits : int z = a&&x$ ... So , the variable a is evaluated to 0 , hence , I don't want to evaluate x , however it still grows by 1 ... here is the code of the bison/c++ : %union
{
    int int_value;
    double double_value;
    char* string_value;
}

%type <int_value> int_expr
%type <double_value> double_expr
%type <double_value> cmp_expr

int_expr:

    | int_expr '&&' int_expr    { /* And operation between two integers */
                      if ($1 == 0) 
                        $$ = 0;

                    }
 How can I tell bison to not evaluate the second expression , if the first one was already evaluated to false (i.e. 0) ?

@TITLE:Ada: Getting user input to a String(1..10) and filling the rest with whitespace
@CONTENT:I have defined subtype String10 is String(1..10);
 and I am attempting to get keyboard input to it without having to manually enter whitespace before hitting enter. I tried get_line() but from some reason it wouldn't actually wait for input before outputting the get put() command, and I also think it will just leave whatever was in the string before there and not fill it with white space. I know about and have used Bounded_String and Unbounded_String, but I am wondering if there is a way to make this work. I've tried making a function for it: --getString10--
procedure getString10(s : string10) is
  c : character;
  k : integer;
begin
  for i in integer range 1..10 loop
     get(c);

        exit;
     end if;
  end loop;

  for i in integer range k..10 loop
     s(i) := ' ';
  end loop;
 end getString10; but, here, I know the s(i) doesn't work, and I don't think the "if Ada.Text_IO.End_Of_Line = false then" 
 does what I'm hoping it will do either. It's kinda just a placeholder while I look for the actual way to do it. I been searching for a couple hours now, but Ada documentation isn't as available or clear as other languages. I've found a lot about getting strings, but not what I'm looking for. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to kill a process whose pid keeps changing?
@CONTENT:I know I can use the trick if (fork()) exit(0); to change the pid of the current process. So, the following program would have a pid changing very quickly. How to kill a process like this? Is there some better method than executing a lot of killall procname until one get able to run kill() before it forks? I know it is not a 'process', but many processes that run for a few microseconds each. #include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    pid_t self = getpid();
    while (1)
    {
        if (fork()) exit(0);

        usleep(1000);
    }
    return 0;
}
 Also the only way I found to list the process was executing ps -A | grep procname a few times until one showed some output. Why isn't the process always listed?
@CODE:if (fork()) exit(0); killall procname kill() #include <unistd.h>

@TITLE:xslt recursive template on parent-child data
@CONTENT:I'm trying to wrap my mind around xslt. A number of questions here on stackoverflow help ( XSLT templates and recursion and XSLT for-each loop, filter based on variable ) but I'm still kinda puzzled. I guess I'm "thinking of template as functions" ( How do I know my XSL is efficient and beautiful? ) Anyway...my data is <Entities>
    <Entity ID="8" SortValue="0" Name="test" ParentID="0" />
    <Entity ID="14" SortValue="2" Name="test2" ParentID="8" />
    <Entity ID="16" SortValue="1" Name="test3" ParentID="8" />
    <Entity ID="17" SortValue="3" Name="test4" ParentID="14" />
    <Entity ID="18" SortValue="3" Name="test5" ParentID="0" />
</Entities>
 What I'd like as output is basically a "treeview" <ul>
    <li id="entity8">
        test
        <ul>
            <li id="entity16">
                test3
            </li>
            <li id="entity14">
                test2
                <ul>
                    <li id="entity17">
                        test4
                    </li>
                </ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="entity18">

 The XSLT I have so far is wrong in that it definitely "thinks of templates as functions" and also throws a StackOverflowException (:-)) on execution <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

@TITLE:Linear regression of arrays containing NANs in Python/Numpy
@CONTENT:I have two arrays, say varx and vary. Both contain NAN values at various positions. However, I would like to do a linear regression on both to show how much the two arrays correlate. This was very helpful so far: http://glowingpython.blogspot.de/2012/03/linear-regression-with-numpy.html However, using this: slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(varx, vary)
 results in nans for every output variable. What is the most convenient way to take only valid values from both arrays as input to the linear regression? I heard about masking arrays, but am not sure how it works exactly.

@TITLE:Using OS X 10.8 Notification Center (NSUserNotification) with Java
@CONTENT:I'm struggling with the notification center in OS X 10.8. I wrote a wrapper to provide Java access to the NSUserNotification and NSUserNotificationCenter classes via JNA, however the functionality is limited. I am able to send a notification and it will display as long as the .jar is being run from an .app bundle via JavaApplicationStub. However, the line below is always logged to the console when the the notification style is set to "Alerts": 11/29/12 8:37:12.537 PM usernoted[162]: Failed to validate application at (null) -67061
 Next, clicking the notification results in the following being logged to the console: 11/29/12 8:38:15.291 PM usernoted[162]: Cannot find originating application to launch for event action.  file://localhost/Users/geoffodonnell/Projects/bin/GuiTest.app/ is not the same app as the one that sent the original notification.
 I did provide the NSUserNotificationCenter class with a delegate, however those methods only get run when the .jar is executed outside of a bundle. Naturally, this defeats the purpose since the notification will never be displayed. Can anyone provide any insight into the two errors above? I am wondering if the JavaApplicationStub is getting in the way, however I'm in the dark when it comes to how exactly a typical application would respond the notification center events.

@LINK:/questions/13635078/java-copy-constructor-and-inheritance
@TITLE:java copy constructor and inheritance
@CONTENT:After some searching I didn't found any good answer to my question regarding copy constructor and inheritance. I have two classes: User and Trainee. Trainee inherits from User and two String parameters are added to Trainee. Now I managed to make a copy constructor of User but I am not satisfied with my copy constructor of Trainee. The code of the User copy constructor is like this: public User (User clone) {
    this(clone.getId(), 
         clone.getCivilite(),
         clone.getNom(), 
         clone.getPrenom(), 
         clone.getEmail(), 
         clone.getLogin(), 
         clone.getTel(), 
         clone.getPortable(), 
         clone.getInscription(), 
         clone.getPw()
    );
}
 I tried to use super in my Trainee copy constructor: public Trainee (Trainee clone) {
    super (clone);
    this (clone.getOsia(), clone.getDateNaiss());
}
 But it didn't work and I was forced to code a full version of the copy constructor: public Trainee (Trainee clone) {
    this(clone.getId(), 
         clone.getCivilite(),
         clone.getNom(),
         clone.getPrenom(), 
         clone.getEmail(), 
         clone.getLogin(), 
         clone.getTel(), 
         clone.getPortable(), 
         clone.getInscription(), 
         clone.getPw(), 
         clone.getOsia(), 
         clone.getDateNaiss()
    );
}
 Because of the construction of my main I have to cast my new instance like this:   User train = new Trainee();
  User train2 = new Trainee((Trainee) train);
 So my question is: Is there a cleaner way to do this? Can't I use a super? Thank you in advance for your answers and assistance.
@CODE:public User (User clone) {
    this(clone.getId(), 
         clone.getCivilite(),
         clone.getNom(), 
         clone.getPrenom(), 
         clone.getEmail(), 
         clone.getLogin(), 
         clone.getTel(), 
         clone.getPortable(), 
         clone.getInscription(), 
         clone.getPw()
    );
} public Trainee (Trainee clone) {
    super (clone);
    this (clone.getOsia(), clone.getDateNaiss());
} public Trainee (Trainee clone) {
    this(clone.getId(), 
         clone.getCivilite(),
         clone.getNom(),
         clone.getPrenom(), 
         clone.getEmail(), 
         clone.getLogin(), 
         clone.getTel(), 
         clone.getPortable(), 
         clone.getInscription(), 
         clone.getPw(), 
         clone.getOsia(), 
         clone.getDateNaiss()
    );
} User train = new Trainee();
  User train2 = new Trainee((Trainee) train); super(clone)

@LINK:/questions/13632919/how-to-implement-optional-first-argument-in-python-reproduce-slice-behavior
@TITLE:How to implement optional first argument in Python (reproduce slice() behavior) [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: How can the built-in range function take a single argument or three? The Python documentation for slice() lists the following method signatures: slice(stop) slice(start, stop[, step]) Here are a few examples of creating a slice object with different numbers of arguments: >>> slice(8)
slice(None, 8, None)
>>> slice(4, 8)
slice(4, 8, None)
>>> slice(4, 8, 2)
slice(4, 8, 2)
 Note that if you call slice() with a single argument, that argument is used as the stop attribute (second argument with the two or three argument signature). Since function overloading does not exist in Python, the typical way to allow a variable number of arguments is to use None as a default value, for example one attempt to reproduce the above behavior would be the following: class myslice(object):
    def __init__(self, start, stop=None, step=None):
        if stop is None and step is None:
            # only one argument was provided, so use first argument as self.stop
            self.start = None
            self.stop = start
        else:
            self.start = start
            self.stop = stop
        self.step = step

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'myslice({}, {}, {})'.format(self.start, self.stop, self.step)
 However this assumes that None is not a value that could be provided for stop, note the following difference in behavior between my implementation and slice(): >>> slice(1, None)
slice(1, None, None)
>>> myslice(1, None)
myslice(None, 1, None)
 Is there some other value that I could use in place of None that would indicate that the parameter was definitely not provided? Alternatively, is there a different way to implement this behavior other than default argument values? Edit: By the way, in CPython, slice() is implemented in C.
@CODE:slice() >>> slice(8)
slice(None, 8, None)
>>> slice(4, 8)
slice(4, 8, None)
>>> slice(4, 8, 2)
slice(4, 8, 2) slice() stop None class myslice(object):
    def __init__(self, start, stop=None, step=None):
        if stop is None and step is None:
            # only one argument was provided, so use first argument as self.stop
            self.start = None
            self.stop = start
        else:
            self.start = start
            self.stop = stop
        self.step = step

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'myslice({}, {}, {})'.format(self.start, self.stop, self.step) None stop slice() >>> slice(1, None)
slice(1, None, None)

@TITLE:Match a word using regex that also handles apostrophes
@CONTENT:I have to separate a line of text into words, and am confused on what regex to use. I have looked everywhere for a regex that matches a word and found ones similar to this post but want it in java (java doesn't handle \ in regular strings). Regex to match words and those with an apostrophe I have tried the regex for each answer and am unsure of how to structure a regex for java for this (i assumed all regex were the same). If replace \ by \ in the regex i see, the regex doesn't work. I have also tried looking it up myself and have come to this page: http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html But I cannot wrap my head around regex advanced techniques. I am using String.split(regex string here) to separate my string. an example is if I'm given the following: "I like to eat but I don't like to eat everyone's food, or they'll starve." I want to match: I
like
to
eat
but
I
don't
like
to
eat
everyone's
food
or
they'll
starve
 I also don't want to match '' or '''' or ' ' or '.'' or other permutations. My delimiter conditions should be similar to: [match any word character][also match an apostrophe if it is preceded by a word character and then match word characters after it if there are any] What i got is just a simple regex that matches words [\w], but i am unsure of how to use lookahead or look behind to match the apostrophe and then the remaining words.

 A        10
 B         8
 Second table: Var    new_number
-------------------
 A          2
 A         11
 B          4
 B          6
 The new table should contain a 'Var' column and a 'Number' column, where for each variable there will be one line with its cur_number, and the rest of the lines will contain the numbers from second table's new_number columns, where the new_number < cur_number. For example, in the example shown above, for A there will be one line with 10 (its cur_number) and one line with '2' (since 2<10, however 11>10). in my example the new table will be: Var         Number
 A            10
 A            2
 B            8
 B            4
 B            6
 The database is very large, and the running time is crucial so I cannot use UNION on the two tables...
@CODE:Var     cur_number
-------------------
 A        10
 B         8 Var    new_number
-------------------

 A         11
 B          4
 B          6 Var         Number
 A            10
 A            2

 As far as I understood, this should read a 2 x 32 array from bounnodes.dat. However, I get an error end-of-file during read and it prints the first column. I tried to read a 32 x 2 array using the same code, and it reads 32 elements of the first column, but outputs 0s for the next column. Can you please explain what is happening? Is my formatting wrong?

@TITLE:Wrong WebFaultException when using a Stream and closing the stream
@CONTENT:We have a REST API, built with WCF. We handle all the exceptions backend with WebFaultException like this: throw new WebFaultException<string>(e.Message, HttpStatusCode.NotAcceptable);
 This works just fine except in one scenario where we do a Post, with a stream. An example of this: [WebInvoke(Method = "POST", UriTemplate = "saveUser?sessionId={sessionId}&userId={userId}",
        RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json,
        ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json,            
        BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest)]
    [OperationContract]
    string SaveUser(string sessionId, int userId, Stream stream);
 When handling this stream in a using statement, whenever we then run into an exception we keep getting: From Fiddler: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request 
  <p>The server encountered an error processing the request. The exception message is 'The message object has been disposed.'. See server logs for more details. The exception stack trace is: </p>
  <p>  at System.ServiceModel.Channels.ByteStreamMessage.InternalByteStreamMessage.get_Properties()
   at System.ServiceModel.OperationContext.get_IncomingMessageProperties()
   at System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.WebErrorHandler.ProvideFault(Exception error, MessageVersion version, Message&amp; fault)</p>
 Looks like it has something to do with the stream and StreamReader being disposed. I have then tried to remove anything that will dispose the StreamReader, and this acctualy works. The code handling this now looks like this: This solves the problem with sending correct exception messages, but how bad will this affect our application, not closing or disposing our StreamReader? Do you see any other ways of solving this ?

@CONTENT:I knocked to a phenomenon in an existing php source, with field access without apostrophe like this: $_GET[test]. I got unsure, also don't know, that this is a possible way, so I wrote a short example for testing: echo "Array Test, fields without apostrophe, like \$_GET[fieldname]<BR><BR>";
$a = array();
$a['test'] = "ArrayValue";
echo "case 1 -> \$a['test']: " . $a['test'] . "<BR>";
echo "case 2 -> \$a[\"test\"]: " . $a["test"] . "<BR>";
echo "case 3 -> \$a[test]: " . $a[test] . "<BR>";
 And it works, every result got the value (ArrayValue). I prefer the access method like case 2. Is case 3 a normal, allowed coding style in php?

@TITLE:Thin white lines being added when cropping an image (Objective-C OSX)
@CONTENT:I am cutting up a large image and saving it into many different images. I first implemented this in iOS and it is working fine, but when I try and port the code to OSX, a thin white line (1 pixel) appears on the top and right of the image. The line is not pure white, or solid (see sample below). Here is the iOS code to make one sub-image, that works like a champ: -(void)testMethod:(int)page forRect:(CGRect)rect{
    NSString *filePath = @"imageName";

    NSData *data = [HeavyResourceManager dataForPath:filePath];//this just gets the image as NSData
    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithData:data];

    CGImageRef imageRef = CGImageCreateWithImageInRect([image CGImage], rect);//crop in the rect

    UIImage *result = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:imageRef scale:0 orientation:image.imageOrientation];
    CGImageRelease(imageRef);

    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    NSString *documentsDirectoryPath = [paths objectAtIndex:0];

    [UIImageJPEGRepresentation(result, 1.0) writeToFile:[documentsDirectoryPath stringByAppendingPathComponent::@"output.jpg"] atomically:YES];
}
 Here is the ported code in OSX that causes the white lines to be added: NSImage *source = [[[NSImage alloc]initWithContentsOfFile:imagePath] autorelease];
//init the image
NSImage *target = [[[NSImage alloc]initWithSize:panelRect.size] autorelease];
//start drawing
[target lockFocus];
[source drawInRect:NSMakeRect(0,0,panelRect.size.width,panelRect.size.height)
          fromRect:NSMakeRect(panelRect.origin.x , source.size.height - panelRect.origin.y - panelRect.size.height, panelRect.size.width, panelRect.size.height)
         operation:NSCompositeCopy
          fraction:1.0];
[target unlockFocus];

//create a NSBitmapImageRep
NSBitmapImageRep *bmpImageRep = [[[NSBitmapImageRep alloc]initWithData:[target TIFFRepresentation]] autorelease];
//write to tiff
[[target TIFFRepresentation] writeToFile:@"outputImage.tiff" atomically:NO];
[target addRepresentation:bmpImageRep];     
NSDictionary *imageProps = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:1.0] forKey:NSImageCompressionFactor];

//get the data from the representation
NSData *data = [bmpImageRep representationUsingType: NSJPEGFileType
                                             properties: imageProps];

//write the data to a file
[data writeToFile: @"outputImage.jpg" atomically:NO];

data = [bmpImageRep representationUsingType: NSPNGFileType properties: imageProps];

//write the data to png
[data writeToFile: @"outputImage.png" atomically:NO];
 The above code saves the image to three different formats to check if the problem was not in the save process of a specific format. It does not seem to be because all the formats have the same problem. Here is a blown up (4x) version of top right hand corner of the images: (OSX, note the white line top and left. It looks like a blur here, because the image is blown up) (iOS, note there are no white lines) If someone could tell me why this might be happening, I would be very happy. Perhaps it has something to do with the quality difference (the OSX version seems lower quality - though you can't notice)? Perhaps there is a completely different way to do this? For reference, here is the unscaled osx image: Update: Thanks to Daij-Djan, I was able to stop the drawInRect method from antialiasing:     //start drawing on target
    [target lockFocus];
    [NSGraphicsContext saveGraphicsState];
    [[NSGraphicsContext currentContext]
            setImageInterpolation:NSImageInterpolationNone];
    [[NSGraphicsContext currentContext] setShouldAntialias:NO];

    //draw the portion of the source image on target image
    [source drawInRect:NSMakeRect(0,0,panelRect.size.width,panelRect.size.height)
              fromRect:NSMakeRect(panelRect.origin.x , source.size.height - panelRect.origin.y - panelRect.size.height, panelRect.size.width, panelRect.size.height)
             operation:NSCompositeDestinationAtop
              fraction:1.0];

    [NSGraphicsContext restoreGraphicsState];
    //end drawing
    [target unlockFocus];
 Update: Changed 'Interpolation' to NSImageInterpolationNone, as this gives a better representation. The high interpolation makes minor adjustments, which is noticeable when zooming in on text. Removing interpolation stops pixels from jumping around, but still, there is a little difference in the color (164 to 155 for a grey color). Would be great to be able to just cut up an image like I can in iOS...

@TITLE:Why does SqlClient use unnecessary XML conversion while passing SqlXml?
@CONTENT:I`ve got a question about passing xml datatype to a query from C# code. First, here`s a table on SQL Server: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[XmlTable](
    [id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [dat] [xml] NOT NULL
)
 Second, I have an application which is written on C#. And I insert rows into the XmlTable from the application. Here`s the code: XDocument doc = new XDocument(new XElement("root",
     new XElement("abc", "123"),
     new XElement("cba", "321")));

var reader = new XmlTextReader(new StringReader(doc.ToString()));
var xml = new SqlXml(reader);

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
{
     using (var command = new SqlCommand("insert into XmlTable (dat) values(@data)", connection))
     {
          command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@data", SqlDbType.Xml){Value = xml});
          connection.Open();
          command.ExecuteNonQuery();
     }
}
 Everything works fine, rows are inserted. But if I run the SQL Profiler and inspect the insert command, I see following: declare @p3 xml
set @p3=convert(xml,N'<root><abc>123</abc><cba>321</cba></root>')
exec sp_executesql N'insert into XmlTable (dat) values(@data)',N'@data xml',@data=@p3
 We can see that in spite of passing SqlXml type into a query SqlClient performs unnecessary conversion from string to XML. XML parser does waste work. The question is: why does SqlClient do this way? And how can I make it do without extra conversion?
@CODE:CREATE TABLE [dbo].[XmlTable](
    [id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [dat] [xml] NOT NULL
) XmlTable XDocument doc = new XDocument(new XElement("root",
     new XElement("abc", "123"),
     new XElement("cba", "321")));

var reader = new XmlTextReader(new StringReader(doc.ToString()));
var xml = new SqlXml(reader);

{
     using (var command = new SqlCommand("insert into XmlTable (dat) values(@data)", connection))

          connection.Open();
          command.ExecuteNonQuery();
     }
} declare @p3 xml

@TITLE:Creating a Generic Circular Buffer
@CONTENT:Given the desire to abstract the structure of a circular buffer from its content, and starting from the following code segments (courtesy of this wikipedia entry): typedef struct
{ 
    int value;
} ElemType;

typedef struct
{
    int         size;      /* total number of elements */
    int         start;     /* index of oldest element */
    int         count;     /* index at which to write new element  */
    ElemType   *elements;  /* vector of elements */
} CircularBuffer;

void cbInit(CircularBuffer *cb, int size) {
    cb->size  = size;
    cb->start = 0;
    cb->count = 0;
    cb->elements = (ElemType *)calloc(cb->size, sizeof(ElemType));
}
 How does one abstract the element type so that it is specified when an instance of the CircularBuffer is defined? My attempt thus far is as follows: CircularBuffer *cbInit(uint16 size, void *element)
{
    CircularBuffer *buffer;

    buffer = malloc(sizeof(*buffer));

    if (buffer != NULL)
    {
        buffer->size = size;
        buffer->start = 0;
        buffer->count = 0;

            free(buffer);
            buffer = NULL;
        }
    }

    return buffer;
}
 But I cannot figure out how to determine the size of an unknown type, which may be an int, a struct, or anything in between. Is what I am attempting to do even possible?

    ElemType   *elements;  /* vector of elements */
} CircularBuffer;

void cbInit(CircularBuffer *cb, int size) {
    cb->size  = size;
    cb->start = 0;

@LINK:/questions/13598351/loading-a-resourcebundle-within-an-osgi-bundle
@TITLE:Loading a ResourceBundle within an OSGi bundle
@CONTENT:I have an application that uses java.util.ResourceBundle to handle display strings. I use the ListResourceBundle as a base type because I want to be able to return an array of strings for some property keys (most of them are the standard name/value pairing). When I'm trying to load the ResourceBundle in the OSGi environment I get a MissingResourceException. I can't figure out why this would occur. I can resolve the class name and make a new instance of the class in the two statements before I try to fetch the bundle, so I know the class is in the bundle. I'm using a locale (en_AU) but not providing a specific class for that locale, the fallback rules should select my default implementation. Even when I added a class for the locale it didn't resolve. The process I go through to fetch data is: The service public interface NameManager {
   public String getCategoryName(String identifier, Locale locale);
}
 The implementation of this public class OsgiNameManager implements NameManager {
   public String getCategoryName(@Nonnull Identifier category, Locale locale)
   {
      try {
        Collection<ServiceReference> references = (Collection)osgiContext.getServiceReferences(
                 DisplayNameProvider.class, "(namespace=" + category + ")");
        Iterator<ServiceReference> it = references.iterator();
        while ( it.hasNext() ) {
           ServiceReference reference = (ServiceReference)it.next();
           DisplayNameProvider namer = (DisplayNameProvider)osgiContext.getService(reference);
           String name = namer.getCategoryName(category, locale);
           osgiContext.ungetService(reference);

           if (name != null)
              return name;
        }
     }
     catch (InvalidSyntaxException badFormat) {
        LOG.warn("No registered provider for category [" + category + "]" , badFormat);
     }

      return null;
   }
}
 This uses a custom service interface, DisplayNameProvider. Modules that wish to register names add this as a service in their activator. The default implementation takes a class for the fully qualified resource bundle name. public class DefaultDisplayNameProvider implements DisplayNameProvider {
    private Class<?> categoryResolver;
    public String getCategoryName(@Nonnull String category, Locale locale)
    {
       ResourceBundle res = ResourceBundle.getBundle(categoryResolver.toString(), locale);
       try {
          return res.getString(CATEGORY_NAME_KEY);
       }
       catch (MissingResourceException noCols) {
          return null;
       }
    }
 }
 (Note, I've left out some fields and static references, but this is the gist of what is done). I'm getting inside of the DefaultDisplayNameProvider so I know the resource is being found. I know the class is in the bundle (it is stored in the internal bundle classes but is visible to the local class loader). My question is what do I need to do load my ResourceBundle's up within OSGi? I'd prefer to continue with this approach rather than start using Resource Fragments or hard-coding string names. Solution Both of the advice below to help with the ClassLoader was useful but it turns out my problem was much simpler. Don't use toString() to get the class name (which I should've known but must have been lazy that day). The correct method to use is Class.getName(). This was found by noticing that if I used a properties file it loaded correctly. Then if I typed the class name in also worked. It was only when I was trying to reduce text entry error by using the existing class reference to get the correct name. I'll stick with the String versions of the resource names. This means the JVM doesn't have to load the class till actually requested (not that there is a lot for it to do at this time).
@CODE:public interface NameManager {
   public String getCategoryName(String identifier, Locale locale);
} public class OsgiNameManager implements NameManager {
   public String getCategoryName(@Nonnull Identifier category, Locale locale)
   {
      try {
        Collection<ServiceReference> references = (Collection)osgiContext.getServiceReferences(
                 DisplayNameProvider.class, "(namespace=" + category + ")");
        Iterator<ServiceReference> it = references.iterator();
        while ( it.hasNext() ) {
           ServiceReference reference = (ServiceReference)it.next();
           DisplayNameProvider namer = (DisplayNameProvider)osgiContext.getService(reference);
           String name = namer.getCategoryName(category, locale);
           osgiContext.ungetService(reference);

           if (name != null)
              return name;
        }
     }

        LOG.warn("No registered provider for category [" + category + "]" , badFormat);

      return null;
   }
} public class DefaultDisplayNameProvider implements DisplayNameProvider {
    private Class<?> categoryResolver;
    public String getCategoryName(@Nonnull String category, Locale locale)
    {
       ResourceBundle res = ResourceBundle.getBundle(categoryResolver.toString(), locale);

@CONTENT:Oftentimes my app will hang on the "trigger.io FORGE" splash screen and never display my UI. I have this happening both in the simulator and on a real device. It's intermittent which leads me to think maybe it's a race condition somewhere (do I need to be waiting for forge to initialize?). I have no idea how to debug this as the trigger console isn't spitting out an error even when showing the debug output. Anything I should check? It's weird because if I put in a call like this: setInterval(function() {
    forge.logging.log('hi');
}, 1000);`
 I can see that my JavaScript code is being executed (and continues to execute as this is successfully logged until I kill the app).. but it's still hung on the splash screen. Oftentimes hitting the home button and re-entering the app will work. But sometimes it takes a few rebuilds before it will get past the splash screen. I've now seen this on 2 different dev environments, 2 different physical devices, and the iOS simulator.

@TITLE:How to get around lack of covariance with IReadOnlyDictionary?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to expose a read-only dictionary that holds objects with a read-only interface. Internally, the dictionary is write-able, and so are the objects within (see below example code). My problem is that IReadOnlyDictionary doesn't support covariant conversions because of the reason outlined in the question here. This means I can't just expose my internal dictionary as a read only one. So my question is, is there an efficient way to convert my internal dictionary to an IReadOnlyDictionary, or some other way to handle this? The options I can think of are: Hold two internal dictionaries and keep them in sync. Create a new dictionary when the property is accessed and cast all the objects within. Cast the IReadOnly's back to NotReadOnly when using it internally. 1 seems like a pain, 2 seems highly inefficient. 3 sounds like the most promising at the moment, but is still ugly. Do I have any other options? public class ExposesReadOnly

What I'd like to be able to do is tell it to search a range, then find cells within that range that contain text that is in my search function. I don't need any kind of result from it other than either TRUE or >1 (if it matches, obviously). In this instance I'm searching a RANGE that is comprised of years, one year in each cell, and trying to find cells in that range that contain a year from a list of years that are all in one cell. Basically I'm wanting to use a function similar to the Search function I think. =SEARCH(text to find, find within text)
 However, I'd like it to do the opposite and find cells that contain some of the text within the source cell: =SEARCH(find within text, text to find)
 Or, more specifically =SEARCH("2001,2002,2003,2004,2005", "2003")
 Is this possible without the use of a Macro? I'd prefer to avoid it if at all possible. All cells in question are formatted as Text. I have been experimenting with COUNTIF, but again it works in the reverse of what I need. Sorry if this question is unclear. Hope someone can help, thanks in advance. Joe

@CONTENT:I have a PopupWindow anchored at a Button (on top). The PopupWindow contains a ScrollView. The PopupWindow is in SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE mode and positionned with offsets Code :     window.setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE);
    window.showAtLocation(parent, Gravity.NO_GRAVITY, xPos, yPos);
 Screen : When the soft Keyboard appears, I have this (the top Button is hidden) : And I would like to have : The PopupWindow is anchored at the Button and also resized. Thanks in advance !

@TITLE:three.js change texture on material
@CONTENT:I'm setting up a texture on a mesh in three.js and when it loads it looks how I want it too:         texture = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture("textures/hash.png");

        texture.needsUpdate = true;

        uniforms = {
            color: { type: "c", value: new THREE.Color( 0xffffff ) },
            texture: { type: "t", value: texture },
        },  

        vertexShader = "varying vec2 vUv; void main() {vUv = uv;gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( position, 1.0 );}",

        fragmentShader = "uniform vec3 color; uniform sampler2D texture; varying vec2 vUv; void main() { vec4 tColor = texture2D( texture, vUv ); gl_FragColor = vec4( mix( color, tColor.rgb, tColor.a ), 1.0 );}",

        material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
            uniforms : uniforms,
            vertexShader    : vertexShader,
            fragmentShader  : fragmentShader
        });
 but I want to change the texture that is on this mesh later on, I have tried this: obj.mesh.material.uniforms.texture = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture("textures/1.png");
obj.mesh.material.uniforms.texture.needsUpdate = true;
 but this doesn't change the texture being displayed on the mesh, how can I change a texture on a THREE.ShaderMaterial ?
@CODE:texture = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture("textures/hash.png");

        texture.needsUpdate = true;

        uniforms = {
            color: { type: "c", value: new THREE.Color( 0xffffff ) },
            texture: { type: "t", value: texture },

        vertexShader = "varying vec2 vUv; void main() {vUv = uv;gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( position, 1.0 );}",

        fragmentShader = "uniform vec3 color; uniform sampler2D texture; varying vec2 vUv; void main() { vec4 tColor = texture2D( texture, vUv ); gl_FragColor = vec4( mix( color, tColor.rgb, tColor.a ), 1.0 );}",

@TITLE:How to create VirtualHost in Ubuntu 12.10 [closed]
@CONTENT:I had followed many articles to 'How to create VirtualHost in Ubuntu'. This is what have I done Installed Apache sudo apt-get  install lamp-server^ phpmyadmin
 I created folder called site1.com in /var/www/ Then I have created the file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/site1.com Then added the following code to that site1.com file <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.site1.com
    ServerAdmin mifas@site1.com
    ServerAlias site1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/site1.com

        AllowOverride all
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all

 Then after that I edit the host file added the following line of code 127.0.0.1   site1.com
 Edit Also I enable the site1.com via sudo a2ensite site1.com Then i restart the apache serivice. (Even i restarted the pc) When I go to the site1.com, It will say The connection has timed out Error Message. But I can browse via localhost/site1.com. I have been trying since last two days. No solution. And followed many articles and videos.

@TITLE:How to load a text file in JavaScript?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a simple WebGL project and need a way to load in models. I decided to use OBJ format so I need a way to load it in. The file is (going to be) stored on the server and my question is: how does one in JS load in a text file and scan it line by line, token by token (like with streams in C++)? I'm new to JS, hence my question. The easier way, the better. UPDATE: I used your solution, broofa, but I'm not sure if I did it right. I load the data from a file in forEach loop you wrote but outside of it (i.e. after all your code) the object I've been filling data with is "undefined". What am I doing wrong? Here's the code: var materialFilename;

function loadOBJModel(filename)
{
    // ...

    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('GET', filename);
    req.responseType = 'text';
    req.onreadystatechange = function()
    {
        if (req.readyState == 4)
        {
            var lines = req.responseText.split(/\n/g);
            lines.forEach(function(line)
            {
                readLine(line);
            });
        }
    }
    req.send();

    alert(materialFilename);

    // ...
}

function readLine(line)
{
    // ...

    else if (tokens[0] == "mtllib")

@TITLE:Advice on composite index
@CONTENT:I have a huge (millions of rows) table that contains the following columns: [When] datetime2(0),
[What] tinyint,
[Who] bigint
 It's basically a table of events ('What') that happened to various entities ('Who') at a time ('When'). There are about 10 different values for 'What' - it is an enumeration. There are about 10,000 values for 'Who' at the moment. I want to be able to query this table, to ask whether something happened to a one or more entities between a certain time. For instance, did [What = 0, 1, 2, 3] happen to [Who = 0, 1, 2, 3] between [When = '2012-10-01' to '2012-11-01']. I'm looking for advice on how best to index this table. I'm fairly sure a composite index is the way to go, but I'm unsure of the exact configuration. For instance, what should the column order be? I've read that the 'most selective' columns should go to the left, which I think in this case would be [When], [Who], [What]. Is this correct? Sorry if this question seems vague, but I'd be grateful for any input. I'm using SQL Server 2012.

@TITLE:Why does leiningen make a directory hierarchy? Can I dispense with it?
@CONTENT:If I create a new clojure project with leiningen, it makes a directory tree like so: .
|-- doc
|   `-- intro.md
|-- project.clj
|-- README.md
|-- src
|   `-- hello_friend
|       `-- core.clj
`-- test
    `-- hello_friend
        `-- core_test.clj
 Often, all I want is a single clojure file, and I want to use leiningen to handle libraries and start a repl. I've got two questions: (1) Is is possible to get leiningen to work properly with this structure .
|-- project.clj
`-- hello.clj
 which I'd greatly prefer. (In fact even better would be to have the project.clj as part of the hello.clj file) (2) Is there any good reason for the deep directory structure? Or is it just a habit from java-land? Note, this works fine as far as I can see: project.clj (defproject generic "0.0.0"
  :dependencies 
  [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
   [hiccup "1.0.2"]]
  :source-paths ["."]

@LINK:/questions/13550914/mock-atleastonce-with-concrete-value-the-rest-not-important
@TITLE:mock atLeastOnce with concrete value, the rest not important
@CONTENT:The question is in PHP, but applies to any language using the xUnit framework. I want a mock, that expects 140 calls to method jump. I need to verify, that at least once there is a call with 500 as parameter. I don't care if all the calls are 500, but I need at least one that is called with 500. $mock = $this->getMock('Trampoline', ['jump']);

$mock->expects($this->atLeastOnce())
     ->method('jump')
     ->with($this->equalTo(500))
     ->will($this->returnValue(true));

$sportsman->setTramploine($mock);
$sportsman->jumpToRandomHeights($times = 140); // this calls Trampoline->jump
// I need to verify the sportsman had jumped 
// to the height of 500 at least once out of the 140 jumps he is performing
 In the current code, the test fails after the first invocation of jump because the first invocation had a value different of 500, meaning the atLestOnce here only indicates that the method should be called, but not that it should be called with specific value among other calls. Solution The missing piece of information was using callbacks inside the with. Thanks to edorian's answer below this is what worked out: $testPassed = false;

$checkMinHeight = function ($arg) use(&$testPassed)
{
    if($arg === 500)
        $testPassed = true;

    // return true for the mock object to consider the input valid
    return true;
}


$mock = $this->getMock('Trampoline', ['jump'])
    ->expects($this->atLeastOnce())
    ->method('jump')
    ->with($checkMinHeight)
    ->will($this->returnValue(true));

$sportsman->setTramploine($mock);
$sportsman->jumpToRandomHeights($times = 1000); // this calls Trampoline->jump
// I need to verify the sportsman had jumped 
// to the height of 500 at least once out of the 1000 jumps he is performing


$this->assertTrue($testPassed, "Sportsman was expected to 
    jump 500m at least once");

@CONTENT:What do the x and y parameters in the getRGB(x, y) method represent? What does the numerical return value represent? How do I identify the color of specific pixels within a BufferedImage that is displayed on a DrawingPanel? Ideally I'd like to 'find' a word within an image, and underline or outline this word to create a relevant hyperlink. How can I translate these numerical values into human understandable colors like 'red' 'green' or 'blue'? Yes, I understand that in the Color class an alpha value of 0-255 represents transparent to opaque. But what does this imply for the actual color? I'm happy to clarify if this doesn't make sense.

@LINK:/questions/13514628/httpwebrequest-doesnt-seem-to-be-sending-a-client-ssl-certificate
@TITLE:HttpWebRequest doesn't seem to be sending a client SSL certificate
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to use an HttpWebRequest to query a remote server running nginx. I need to provide a client certificate to complete the connection. I'm doing the following: Dim Request As HttpWebRequest = DirectCast(WebRequest.Create(Url), HttpWebRequest)
Dim Cert = SSL.GetClientCertificate()
Request.ClientCertificates.Clear()
Request.ClientCertificates.Add(Cert)
Dim Response As WebResponse = Request.GetResponse()
 (SSL.GetClientCertificate is just a helper method which opens the My store on the Local machine and retrieves the appropriate certificate (as an X509Certificate2). The correct certificate is being returned. I've also tried just loading in the certificate from a file with identical results.) As things stand, when I get to the Dim Response As... and it actually attempts to open the connection, I get a 400 Bad Request returned with the following body: 400 Bad Request
No required SSL certificate was sent
-----------------------------------
nginx/1.0.10
 We're using our own CA which has a certificate in the LocalMachine\TrustedRootCertificationAuthorities on my machine. The client certificate is valid but fails verification as our CA doesn't expose an OCSP endpoint. If I create an X509Chain and ask it to verify the chain without checking for revocation, everything passes. So my question is... Why isn't the certificate being sent with the request? I don't believe it should be attempting to verify the client certificate before sending it (that's the servers job). I won't deluge you in Wireshark logs but the client isn't sending the certificate. In short, I get ... [Out] Client Hello [In] Server Hello [In] Certificate [In] Server Hello Done [Out] Certificate, Client Key Exchange, Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshake Message [In] Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshake Message [Out] Application Data (Presumably the GET request) [In] Application Data (Presumably the 400) [In] Encrypted Alert (Terminates the channel) I think nginx is doing something clever where instead of dying when I fail to send the certificate, it renegotiates to allow it to send a 400 response body (instead of failing to create a channel in the first place) In any case, I'm not sending the certificate which is the real issue. Does anyone know why? In case it helps, nginx's logs insist no certificate is being sent (as opposed to a cert being invalid): 2012/11/22 14:16:26 [info] 27755#0: *799 client sent no required SSL certificate while reading client request headers, client: 10.0.0.200, server: 10.0.0.100, request: "GET /state HTTP/1.1", host: "10.0.0.100" Please do not use the code below - it's inefficient, unreliable and was only used for testing Re: Getting the Certificate: Public Shared Function GetClientCertificate() As X509Certificate2

@TITLE:How to explicitly close datasets in GDAL ruby binding?
@CONTENT:I am using GDAL 1.7.1 from ruby1.9 to generate GeoTIFF files. In the tutorial they recommend to use GDALClose() to close the datasets and flush any remaining content to the filesystem. The same happens in the destructor for the dataset. The problem is that the ruby bindings rely on this destructor mechanism to close the dataset, and I need the result of the file already in the process that generates it. Since ruby is garbage collected, it seems I can not reliably close my files, without exiting the ruby process. For now I patched my version of GDAL to support the GDALClose method, but this doesn't seem to be a good long term solution. require 'gdal/gdal'

[...]

# open the driver for geotiff format
driver = Gdal::Gdal.get_driver_by_name('GTiff')
# create a new file
target_map = driver.create(output_path,
                xsize,
                ysize, 3,
                Gdal::Gdalconst::GDT_UINT16, ["PHOTOMETRIC=RGB"])

# write band data
3.times do |i|
    band = target_map.band(i + 1)
    target_map.write_band(i + 1, mapped_data)
end

# now I would like to use the file in output_path, but at this point 
# large parts of the data still resides in memory it seems until 
# target_map is destroyed

file = File.open( output_path, "r" )

[...]
 Is there something in either ruby or swig to force the destructor call, that I may have overlooked?
@CODE:require 'gdal/gdal'

[...]

# open the driver for geotiff format
driver = Gdal::Gdal.get_driver_by_name('GTiff')
# create a new file
target_map = driver.create(output_path,
                xsize,
                ysize, 3,
                Gdal::Gdalconst::GDT_UINT16, ["PHOTOMETRIC=RGB"])

# write band data
3.times do |i|
    band = target_map.band(i + 1)
    target_map.write_band(i + 1, mapped_data)
end

# now I would like to use the file in output_path, but at this point

file = File.open( output_path, "r" )

I use a multiline TextBox to output some information in new lines as it arrives from a BackgroundWorker. Can I make it to scroll to the very bottom each time a new line arrives? By default it seems to do just the opposite - it scrolls to the very first line each time a new line arrives and the Text property is changed.

 This is with a clean, new project (File  New  Project...  Visual C++  CLR  Windows Forms Application). After I create a new project, opening up the autogenerated Form1.h results in the error instead of the Designer. However, if I create a C# Windows Forms Application instead of C++/CLI, it works fine. Any ideas on how I can solve this problem and open up the Designer? I've tried all of the following to no avail: Reinstalling VS 2010 SP1 Running Windows Update, which installed two VS-related updates ("Update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2736182)" and "Update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime (KB2764593)") Installing KB2635973, which fixes a similar-looking issue Rebooting after installing the above Turning off all DirectX debugging/validation settings in the DirectX Control Panel Uninstalling anything with "Microsoft SQL Server Compact" in its name via the "Program and Features" control panel I've found a few similar threads online (one, two, three), but they've all been inconclusive or not worked for me. I've not yet tried fully reinstalling Visual Studio, but I may have to try that next.

@TITLE:Jenkins - Running install tests on remote machine and reporting results back to Jenkins
@CONTENT:I am looking to add some automated tests to run nightly on a project. Currently the project has a few jobs that create multiple builds of various components of the project. The builds create rpm files, there are multiple jobs creating multiple rpms, I want to grab all of the rpms and install them and test them all under a single test job, there are lots of dependencies on each other. I can install via the command line but these rpms are stored on the Jenkins master machine. This is as far as I have got; I have set up the job in Jenkins I have created a slave for the job to run on I have used Jenkins to run a bash script on the slave (works) What I want to do is the following; At regular intervals (lets say once per day when I know builds have all completed) fetch the most recent passed builds of all the projects and copy them to the slave machine Install the rpms using a script. The script performs certain tests during the install (looking at logs etc...) so I want to collect these all and send the results back to Jenkins (may eventually perform other tests here too) I want the status of the last build image to be determined by my own tests I also want the test results, logs, etc... to be stored in the Jenkins test job so that we can view them and marvel at their awesomeness! What I don't know how to do is; How to copy the files to the slave? Should this be handled on the slave itself using wget or something, or does Jenkins have the functionality (plugin maybe) that handles this all for me? How do I report my custom results back to the Jenkins job? I only started working with Jenkins three days ago (the project and Jenkins build jobs are a lot older than that), apologies if I'm missing anything obvious. UPDATE I'm thinking a combination of these plugins might do the trick, I've not yet looked into these too much yet though. Copy artifact plugin to copy the rpms from the latest stable builds of the other jobs xUnit plugin to interpret some xml files that I generate during the test process

@CONTENT:Simple bug that needs to be fixed and I can't figure out what's wrong. I need to append the same picture to multiple (five) divs in the HTML. For some reason, my code is appending the same picture five times to each div. Making it more clear, each of the five divs needs one picture. Right now, all five have five pictures each. Here is the JQUERY: $(".faq").each(function(){

});
 This is where it is being inserted: <div class="letter-q"></div>
 There are five of those spread out across the body. It's probably something small I'm missing. Any help would be appreciated!

 My problem is that the function is ran without me having to click on the element. I know this because I put print statements within the function.

B=[100;300;500;1000]
 I want to have the list of possible combinations where : All sub-components of A MUST be included sub-components of B can be added until the the SUM of all sub-componenets added is greater than 2000 Anyone has an idea how to do this in Matlab ? My try : X=sum(A);

   X=X+B(y);
   if(X>2000)
       disp('Following is unacceptable')

end
 However this code is not correct. It just adding the first element of B then adding it with the second element and so on. It isn't providing me with possible combinations. Example : sum(A) + B(1) = OK sum(A) + B(4) = NOT OK sum(A) + B(1) + B(2) = OK sum(A) + B(2) + B(3) = OK etc... I want this to be automated if values of A or B change in the future. I am not sure if this is a case of probability as well.

three
four
 I'd like to parse it into a list of strings, ['one','two','three','four']. BeautifulSoup's tag-closing logic means that I get nested tags when I ask for all the <br> elements. >>> bs('br')

By right-clicking on the project in XCODE, I mistakenly clicked "Discard Changes" (stupidity reigns again) I did not have any commits since the initial and when I did the Discard Changes, it seems that it went all the way back to the initial commit, which if I am looking at things correctly looks like each file is as it was the very first time it was saved. My question is: Is there a way to recover my work? Is it in the .git directory? Is a copy stored elsewhere? or as a last resort, any chance to recover some of the source text with an un-delete utility? Thanks, Bob

If so, How would I call it at #1, #2, and #3? As you can see I am simply confused as to how OOP works. First of all, I want to express how much I appreciate all of the help. I have already learned more than enough to consider this question a smashing success. That said, even if it is poorly formulated, psuedo-code and invalid syntax, this code DOES run. class class_1{

}

$class_1 = new class_1;

//&&&&&&&&&& Get the DATA here?

@TITLE:Gmail IMAP OAuth2 returns error code 400
@CONTENT:When trying to connect to the Google IMAP service using the XOAUTH2 mechanism (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/xoauth2_protocol), I sometimes receive the following error response: {"status":"400","schemes":"Bearer","scope":"https://mail.google.com/"}
 I was wondering if anyone knew what exactly that status 400 was ...

@TITLE:Model change in post action not visible in Html.TextBoxFor?
@CONTENT:This must be something very obvious but for me it looks very strange. I have simple controller, model with one property, and view which displays value of property and renders editor for that property. When I click the button, form is posted and exclamation mark is appened to property. This exclamation mark is visible in my view but only in p tag, not in input tag rendered by Html.TextBoxFor(). Why Html.TextBoxFor() ignores that I updated my model in post action? Is there any way to change this behavior of Html.TextBoxFor()? View @model ModelChangeInPostActionNotVisible.Models.IndexModel

@using (Html.BeginForm())
{
    <p>@Model.MyProperty</p>
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.MyProperty)
    <input type="submit" />
}
 Model namespace ModelChangeInPostActionNotVisible.Models
{
    public class IndexModel
    {
        public string MyProperty { get; set; }
    }
}
 Controller namespace ModelChangeInPostActionNotVisible.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View(new IndexModel { MyProperty = "hi" });
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult Index(IndexModel model)
        {
            model.MyProperty += "!";
            return View(model);
        }
    }
}
 HTML after clicking on submit button <form action="/" method="post">    <p>hi!</p>
<input id="MyProperty" name="MyProperty" type="text" value="hi" />    <input type="submit" />
</form>
