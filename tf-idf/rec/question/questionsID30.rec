@LINK:/questions/2752523/does-new-dynamic-variable-type-in-net-4-0-solve-the-single-multiple-method-di
@TITLE:Does new 'dynamic' variable type in .NET 4.0 solve the single/multiple method dispatch issue in CLR?
@CONTENT:The problem of single dispatch is mostly familiar to people engaged in coding with statically typed languages like Java and C#. The basic idea is: While the runtime polymorphism allows us to dispatch to the right method call according to the type (runtime type) of receiver, for example: IAnimal mything = new Cat();
mything.chop();
 The method call will be performed according to the runtime type of mything, namely Cat. This is the single dispatch capability (which is present in Java/C#). Now, if you need to dispatch not only on the runtime type of receiver, but on the types of (multiple) arguments either, you face a little problem: public class MyAcceptor {  
    public void accept (IVisitor vst) {...}   
    public void accept (EnhancedConcreteVisitor vst) {...}  
}
 The second method never gets called, because in our 'consumer' code we just tend to treat different types of objects (visitors in my example) by their common supertype or interface. That's why I ask - because dynamic typing allows the multiple dispatch polymorphism and C# 4.0 has that dynamic keyword ;)
@CODE:receiver IAnimal mything = new Cat();
mything.chop(); mything Cat public class MyAcceptor {  
    public void accept (IVisitor vst) {...}   
    public void accept (EnhancedConcreteVisitor vst) {...}  
}

@TITLE:multi-core processing in R on windows XP - via doMC and foreach
@CONTENT:I'm posting this question to ask for advice on how to optimize the use of multiple processors from R on a Windows XP machine. At the moment I'm creating 4 scripts (each script with e.g. for (i in 1:100) and (i in 101:200), etc) which I run in 4 different R sessions at the same time. This seems to use all the available cpu. I however would like to do this a bit more efficient. One solution could be to use the "doMC" and the "foreach" package but this is not possible in R on a Windows machine. e.g. library("foreach")
library("strucchange")
library("doMC") # would this be possible on a windows machine?
registerDoMC(2)  # for a computer with two cores (processors)
## Nile data with one breakpoint: the annual flows drop in 1898
## because the first Ashwan dam was built
data("Nile")
plot(Nile)

## F statistics indicate one breakpoint
fs.nile <- Fstats(Nile ~ 1)
plot(fs.nile)
breakpoints(fs.nile)     # , hpc = "foreach" --> It would be great to test this.

@LINK:/questions/2647261/suggestions-of-the-easiest-algorithms-for-some-graph-operations
@TITLE:Suggestions of the easiest algorithms for some Graph operations
@CONTENT:The deadline for this project is closing in very quickly and I don't have much time to deal with what it's left. So, instead of looking for the best (and probably more complicated/time consuming) algorithms, I'm looking for the easiest algorithms to implement a few operations on a Graph structure. The operations I'll need to do is as follows: List all users in the graph network given a distance X List all users in the graph network given a distance X and the type of relation Calculate the shortest path between 2 users on the graph network given a type of relation Calculate the maximum distance between 2 users on the graph network Calculate the most distant connected users on the graph network A few notes about my Graph implementation: The edge node has 2 properties, one is of type char and another int. They represent the type of relation and weight, respectively. The Graph is implemented with linked lists, for both the vertices and edges. I mean, each vertex points to the next one and each vertex also points to the head of a different linked list, the edges for that specific vertex. What I know about what I need to do: I don't know if this is the easiest as I said above, but for the shortest path between 2 users, I believe the Dijkstra algorithm is what people seem to recommend pretty often so I think I'm going with that. I've been searching and searching and I'm finding it hard to implement this algorithm, does anyone know of any tutorial or something easy to understand so I can implement this algorithm myself? If possible, with C source code examples, it would help a lot. I see many examples with math notations but that just confuses me even more. Do you think it would help if I "converted" the graph to an adjacency matrix to represent the links weight and relation type? Would it be easier to perform the algorithm on that instead of the linked lists? I could easily implement a function to do that conversion when needed. I'm saying this because I got the feeling it would be easier after reading a couple of pages about the subject, but I could be wrong. I don't have any ideas about the other 4 operations, suggestions?

@TITLE:Fastest container or algorithm for unique reusable ids in C++
@CONTENT:I have a need for unique reusable ids. The user can choose his own ids or he can ask for a free one. The API is basically class IdManager {
public:
  int AllocateId();          // Allocates an id
  void FreeId(int id);       // Frees an id so it can be used again
  bool MarkAsUsed(int id);   // Let's the user register an id. 
                             // returns false if the id was already used.
  bool IsUsed(int id);       // Returns true if id is used.
};
 Assume ids happen to start at 1 and progress, 2, 3, etc. This is not a requirement, just to help illustrate. IdManager mgr;
mgr.MarkAsUsed(3);
printf ("%d\n", mgr.AllocateId());
printf ("%d\n", mgr.AllocateId());
printf ("%d\n", mgr.AllocateId());
 Would print 1

4
 Because id 3 has already been declared used. What's the best container / algorithm to both remember which ids are used AND find a free id? If you want to know the a specific use case, OpenGL's glGenTextures, glBindTexture and glDeleteTextures are equivalent to AllocateId, MarkAsUsed and FreeId
@CODE:class IdManager {
public:
  int AllocateId();          // Allocates an id
  void FreeId(int id);       // Frees an id so it can be used again
  bool MarkAsUsed(int id);   // Let's the user register an id. 
                             // returns false if the id was already used.
  bool IsUsed(int id);       // Returns true if id is used.
}; IdManager mgr;

@CONTENT:Java has its own garbage collection implementation so it does not require any destructor like C++ . This makes Java developer lazy in implementing memory management. Still we can have destructor along with garbage collector where developer can free resources and which can save garbage collector's work. This might improves the performance of application. Why does Java not provide any destructor kind of mechanism? Developer does not have control over GC but he/she can control or create object. Then why not give them ability to destruct the objects?

@TITLE:Java source code generation frameworks [closed]
@CONTENT:I have a set of Java 5 source files with old-style Doclet tags, comments and annotations. And based on that I would like to write a generator for another set of Java classes. What is the best way to do that? And are there any good standalone libraries for code analysis/generation in Java? Any shared exprience in this field is appreciated. So, far I have found these: JaxME's Java Source Reflection - seems good, but it does not seem to support annotations. Also it had no release since 2006. Annogen - uses JDK's Doclet generator, which has some bugs under 1.5 JDK. Also it had no releases for a long time. Javaparser - seems good as well and pretty recent, but only supports Visitor pattern for a single class i.e. no query mechanism like in the 2 above packages.

@CONTENT:One of major hurdles I seem to be having recently is getting my head around some of the more complex routing requirements for some MVC based applications I've been developing. I'm having problems finding the right set of tutorials to walk me through it to get a complete understanding. What I'd like to find is a complete set of tutorials for everything routing from basic (controller/action/id) to advanced. An example of what I'm calling advanced routing is things like: /blog/year/month/day/title - would map to controller: blog and action: post and as parameters: year, month, day and title /blog/title - would map to controller: blog and action: post and as parameters: title /title - would map to controller: blog and action: post and as parameters: title I could map each possible set to an explicit route in global using a database, but that seems like it's defeating the point of having the routing engine route to the correct place. I'd rather define the rule once.

The basic idea of what I want is to make a list of tasks or task steps and let them be picked up and worked on by independent threads, ideally out of a pool limited to 'n' number of threads. Is this possible? If so, how? Could someone show guide me to that point from where I'm currently at? The simple project I have is from this tutorial here.

@TITLE:SCJP question: Java method overloading with var-args. What is the rationale?
@CONTENT:Why does the following program throw an exception? public class MainClass{
  public static void main(String[] argv){

  }
  public static void callMethod(Integer... i){
       System.out.println("Wrapper");
  }
  public static void callMethod(int... i){
       System.out.println("Primitive");
  }
 } The method callMethod(Integer[]) is ambiguous for the type MainClass OK, I can see that either of the two methods will work (if the other is commented out), but I also know that there is hierarchy on what happens if a primitive is not exactly matched by the type of the input of a method. The first thing that is tried is to widen the primitive. So, if there was a third method:       public static void callMethod(long i){
       System.out.println("long");
      }
 The code would print long The second thing is to box the primitive. So if there was a method taking an Integer, that would be the one invoked. The third priority is the var-args. Based on the above priority, I would expect that the second priotity be the case. I would expect the int to be wrapped into an Integer and the (Integer...) would be invoked. But of course this does not happen. Instead, the exception is thrown. Does anyone see and can explain why the prioritization does not apply in this example? Cheers!

@CONTENT:>>> class A(object): pass
>>> def func(cls): pass
>>> A.func = func
>>> A.func
<unbound method A.func>
 How does this assignment create a method? It seems unintuitive that assignment does the following for classes: Turn functions into unbound instance methods Turn functions wrapped in classmethod() into class methods (actually, this is pretty intuitive) Turn functions wrapped in staticmethod() into functions It seems that for the first, there should be an instancemethod(), and for the last one, there shouldn't be a wrapper function at all. I understand that these are for uses within a class block, but why should they apply outside of it? But more importantly, how exactly does assignment of the function into a class work? What magic happens that resolves those 3 things? Even more confusing with this: >>> A.func
<unbound method A.func>
>>> A.__dict__['func']
<function func at 0x...>
 But I think this is something to do with descriptors, when retrieving attributes. I don't think it has much to do with the setting of attributes here.
@CODE:>>> class A(object): pass
>>> def func(cls): pass
>>> A.func = func
>>> A.func
<unbound method A.func> classmethod() staticmethod() instancemethod() class >>> A.func

@TITLE:Using email instead of login name in django
@CONTENT:Firstly, this is not the question how to authenticate on email/password pair, but rather how to produce logical, and if you like, beautiful data structure. I want to use emails as user names in a given django project. However, I am unable to re-use fields provided by auth.User model for at least two reasons: auth.User.username 's field max_length is 30 characters, which might not be enough for some email addresses. auth.User.email is not unique - which is obviously not satisfactory for a prerequisite saying that user names have to be unique. So an obvious way here is to store username in a custom profile, which is linked to auth.User. In this case we have to deal with following problems: Generate unique username for auth.User.username - md5 hash of email should be fine here? Leave out completely auth.User.email empty - since it's only 75 characters long, while according to RFC 5321 (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/386294/maximum-length-of-a-valid-email-id) email can be as long as 256 characters. The following problems stem from the proposed solution: One is not going to be able to reuse built-in views/templates for standard operations like password reset etc In case of email change auth.User.username will have to be updated To add oil into the fire, django developers are not likely to fix this limitation in any foreseeable future - see http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11365 So the question is: is there any other way to do it and do you see any other drawbacks in the solution proposed above?

@LINK:/questions/2102815/jquery-time-ago-from-a-timestamp
@TITLE:jQuery Time ago from a timestamp?
@CONTENT:Below is a really nice time ago plugin for jQuery, very similar to what they use here on SO. The problem for me is that it uses this to convert time. <time class="timeago" datetime="2008-07-17T09:24:17Z">July 17, 2008</time>
 That would be great except that I store time on my site in UTC timestamp and not as a formatted time, is there a way to convert something like this to use a timestamp? I know in PHP I could convert my timestamp to this format but it seems like overkill with converting a LOT of times on 1 page in PHP. I could be wrong, anyone else do this in jquery but from real timestamp? Also I currently do this in PHP on a site to show "2 hours 4 minutes ago" but wou7ld it be better to use javascript for this instead of PHP? /*

@TITLE:Ruby: attr_accessor generated methods - how to iterate them (in to_s - custom format)?
@CONTENT:I need a Class which has an semi-automatic 'to_s' method (to generate XML in fact). I would like to iterate through all the automatic methods set up in my 'attr_accessor' line: class MyClass
    attr_accessor :id,:a,:b,:c
end

c=MyClass.new
 So far I'm doing a basic: c.methods - Object.methods

=> ["b", "b=", "c", "c=", "id=", "a", "a="]
 I am facing a few challenges: 'id' may cause a slight headache - as Object already seems to have an 'id'. The 'c.methods' call above, returns Strings - I'm not getting any other meta-data ? (In Java 'method' is an object, where I could perform further reflection). I have one-to-many relationships I have to deal with ('c' is an array type of other object types). This is what I'm trying to do: I want to design a simple Object which has a 'to_s' which will build up an XML fragment: for instance. <id> 1 </id>
<a> Title </a>
<b> Stuff </b>
<c>
    <x-from-other-object>
    <x-from-other-object>
    ....
</c>
 And then inherit my data-classes from that simple object: so that (hopefully) I get a mechansim to build up an entire XML doc. I'm sure I'm re-inventing the wheel here as well...so other tried-and-tested approaches welcome.
@CODE:class MyClass
    attr_accessor :id,:a,:b,:c
end

c=MyClass.new c.methods - Object.methods

=> ["b", "b=", "c", "c=", "id=", "a", "a="] <id> 1 </id>

I'm not saying that a swirl effect doesn't have it's uses, it's just that many of the examples I've found have the basic effect explained and don't go into how it might be used subtly with another effect or transition to produce a wonderful effect. There's a video here, that outlines all the WPF Effects Library, but I'm not sure how I would use some of them in a practical context. For example, when Flash 8 came out with effects like blur, I found a wonderful video that showed how to use the blur effect to create a cool effect with speeding text, that video inspired many ideas of what I could do with the effects in Flash 8.

@LINK:/questions/1856411/what-works-to-pass-touches-through-to-and-display-all-subviews
@TITLE:What works to pass touches through to (and display all) subviews?
@CONTENT:I have the following subview chain: UIViewController.view -+
                       |-> UIView (subclass) -+
                       |                      +-> UIToolbar 
                       |
                       +------------------------> UIWebView
 In the subclass, I override its -touchesEnded:forEvent: method in order to hide and show the UIToolbar on a single tap touch, through a CAAnimation, as well as issue an NSNotification that causes the view controller to hide its navigation bar. If I do not add the UIWebView as a subview to the view controller's view, then this works properly. If I then add the UIWebView as a subview of the view controller's view, then the UIToolbar does not appear, and I do not get the animation effect. The UIWebView responds to touches but the subclassed UIView does not. The notification does get fired, though, and the navigation bar does get hidden. What is the best way to arrange these subviews so that: The UIToolbar can be made to slide on and off the screen The UIWebView is visible can still receive its typical touch-events: zoom in/out and double-tap to reset zoom level A correct answer will meet both criteria. EDIT I made some progress with this, but I cannot distinguish touch events and thus I fire a toolbar hide/show method when it should not be fired. I set the view controller's view property to the UIView subclass, and I inserted the web view at the top of the -subviews array via [self.view insertSubview:self.webView atIndex:0]. I added the following method to the UIView subclass: - (UIView *) hitTest:(CGPoint) point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UIView *subview = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event];

    if (event.type == UIEventTypeTouches) {
        [self toggleToolbarView:self];

    // get touches
    NSSet *touches = [event allTouches];

    NSLog(@"subview: %@", subview);
    NSLog(@"touches: %@", touches);

    // individual touches
    for (UITouch *touch in touches) {
        switch (touch.phase) {
            case UITouchPhaseBegan:
                NSLog(@"UITouchPhaseBegan");
                break;
            case UITouchPhaseMoved:
                NSLog(@"UITouchPhaseMoved");
                break;
            case UITouchPhaseCancelled:
                NSLog(@"UITouchPhaseCancelled");
                break;
            case UITouchPhaseStationary:
                NSLog(@"UITouchPhaseStationary");
                break;  	
            default:
                NSLog(@"other phase...");
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return subview;
}
 The method -toggleToolbarView: triggers an NSTimer-timed CAAnimation that hides/shows a UIToolbar*. The problem is that a touch-drag combination causes -toggleToolbarView: to be fired (as well as zooming in or out of the web view). What I would like to do is cause -toggleToolbarView: to be fired only when there is a touch-only event. When I call the above method -hitTest:withEvent:, it looks like the UIWebView sucks up the touches. The two NSLog statements show that the UIView* that is returned from the parent UIView*'s -hitTest:withEvent: is either the UIWebView or the UIToolbar (when it is on-screen and touched). The touches array is empty and therefore the touch event types cannot be distinguished. There's one more thing I will try, but I wanted to record this attempt here in case others have quick suggestions. Thanks for your continued help. EDIT II I made some progress with getting the UIWebView to pinch/zoom and respond to double-taps. I can also hide/show the toolbar with single-taps. Instead of messing with the UIWebView instance's private UIScroller, I access its inner, private UIWebDocumentView. But the web view as a whole does not redraw properly after zooming in. What this means: If my document contains a PDF or an SVG vector illustration, for example, zooming in causes the contents to be blurry, as if the image tiles that make up the rendered PDF or vector illustration contents are not being re-rendered at the new zoom factor. For the purposes of documenting this, I will: Call the UIView (subclass) instead ViewerOverlayView The UIWebView is called ViewerWebView Both are subclasses of UIView and UIWebView, respectively. My ViewerWebView contains a new ivar (with @property + @synthesized): UIView *privateWebDocumentView;
 (This UIView is actually a pointer to a UIWebDocumentView instance, but to avoid Apple flagging the app for refusal I cast this to a UIView for the simple purpose of passing it touch events.) The implementation of ViewerWebView overrides -hitTest:withEvent: - (UIView *) hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UIView *_subview = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event];
    self.privateWebDocumentView = _subview;
    return _subview;
}
 My ViewerOverlayView contains new ivars (with @property + @synthesized): ViewerWebView *webView;
UIView *webDocumentView;
 In the implementation of the overlay view, I override -touchesBegan:withEvent:, -touchesMoved:withEvent: and -touchesEnded:withEvent: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    self.touchHasMoved = NO;
    if (self.webView) {
        UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
        CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self];
        self.webDocumentView = [self.webView hitTest:touchPoint withEvent:event];
    }
    [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
    [self.webDocumentView touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
}

- (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    self.touchHasMoved = YES;
    if (self.webView) {
        UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
        CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self];
        self.webDocumentView = [self.webView hitTest:touchPoint withEvent:event];
    }
    [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event];
    [self.webDocumentView touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event];
}

- (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    if(!self.touchHasMoved) 
        [self toggleToolbarView:self];
    if (self.webView) {
        UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
        CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self];
        self.webDocumentView = [self.webView hitTest:touchPoint withEvent:event];
    }
    [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event];
    [self.webDocumentView touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event];
}
 In the view controller, I do the following: Instantiate the ViewerOverlayView and add it as a subview of the view controller's view property Instantiate the view controller's ViewerWebView instance and insert it at the bottom of the subviews array Set the ViewerOverlayView web view property to the view controller's web view So now my transparent ViewerOverlayView correctly passes zoom/stretch/double-tap touch events to the ViewerWebView instance's private UIWebDocumentView instance. The UIWebDocumentView then resizes. However, the content does not redraw itself with the new scale. So vector-based content (e.g. PDF, SVG) looks blurry when zooming in. Here's what the view looks like without scaling, nice and sharp: Here's what the view looks like when zoomed in, which is not as sharp as it would otherwise be without all this custom event munging: Interestingly, I can only rescale between two zoom levels. Once I stop double-tap-stretching to zoom in at any level, it then "snaps back" to the frame you see in the image above. I tried -setNeedsDisplay on the ViewerWebView and its inner UIWebDocumentView instance. Neither method call worked. Despite wanting to avoid private methods, because I want to eventually get this app approved, I also tried this suggestion of accessing the private UIWebDocumentView method -_webCoreNeedsDisplay: [(UIWebDocumentView *)self.webDocumentView _webCoreNeedsDisplay];
 This method caused the app to crash from an unrecognized selector exception. Perhaps Apple has changed the name of this method from SDK 3.0 to 3.1.2. Unless there is a way to cause the web view to redraw its contents, I guess I'm going to have to scrap the transparent overlay view and just draw a web view, in order to get the web view to work properly. That sucks! If anyone has thoughts about redrawing-after-scaling, please feel free to add an answer. Thanks again to all of you for your input. As an aside, I did not cancel the bounty on this question -- I do not know why it was not automatically awarded to the first answer to this thread, as I was otherwise expecting to happen from previous experience. EDIT III I found this web page that shows how to subclass the application window so as to observe taps and forward those taps to the view controller. It's not necessary to implement its delegate everywhere throughout the application, only where I want to observe taps on UIWebView, so this may work really well for a document viewer. So far, I can observe taps, hide and show the toolbar, and the UIWebView behaves like a web view. I can zoom in and out of the web view and the document is re-rendered properly. While it would be nice to learn how to manage taps in a more generic fashion, this looks like a pretty great solution.

@CONTENT:I've installed Git to do some development using Visual Studio 2008. Most of the work will be new development but we do have some old projects from prior to VS2005 that I want to bring over into the new repository. There is an existing thread about general VS/Git integration but my question is limited to the .gitignore file and Visual Studio. My question has two parts: What entries should be included in the .gitignore file to cover the Visual Studio specific files like binaries, assemblies, debug files, etc? Some were covered in the thread mentioned above but is there a comprehensive set? In what situations have you needed to exclude files globally, or for a single repository, or using the environment variable? I already know the HOW. Here is an excerpt from the Git user-manual on ignoring files. If you wish the exclude patterns to affect only certain repositories (instead of every repository for a given project), you may instead put them in a file in your repository named .git/info/exclude, or in any file specified by the core.excludesfile configuration variable. Some git commands can also take exclude patterns directly on the command line. See gitignore(5) for the details.

I say at the end of the day as to ensure the repository is as up to date as possible. However code at the end of the day may be incomplete/break functionality.

Regarding PMD: 1.1 How do I set the PMD checks, to ignore some of them, like "Variable name is too short, or too long", "Remove empty constructor, etc" - and if I do that, another warning appears that says the class must have some static methods. Basically, the class was empty, for later development, and I like to leave it that way for now. 1.2 Is it necesarry to follow this warning advice?   A class which only has private constructors should be final
 1.3 What is that supposed to mean?  The class 'Dog' has a Cyclomatic Complexity of 3 (Highest = 17)
 1.4 What about this one? I would love to change this, but nothing crosses my mind at the moment regarding the change: Assigning an Object to null is a code smell. Consider refactoring.
 2.Regarding FindBugs: 2.1 Is it really that bad to write to a static field, at some point later than its declaration? The following code gives me a warning: Main.appCalendar = Calendar.getInstance();
Main.appCalendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
 where appCalendar is a static variable. 2.2 This code: strLine = objBRdr.readLine().trim();
 gives the warning: Immediate dereference of the result of readLine()
 where objBRdr is a BufferedReader(FileReader). What could happen? readLine() could be null? The code is nested in while (objBRdr.ready()) test, and so far, I have zero problems there. Update1: 2.2 was fixed when I replaced the code with: strLine = objBRdr.readLine();
    if (strLine != null) {
        strLine = strLine.trim();
    }

@TITLE:Proper use of UIRectClip to scale a UIImage down to icon size
@CONTENT:Given a UIImage of any dimension, I wish to generate a square "icon" sized version, px pixels to a side, without any distortion (stretching). However, I'm running into a little snag. Not quite sure where the problem is. Here's what I'm doing so far. First, given a UImage size, I determine three things: the ratio to use when scaling down the image; a delta (the difference between our desired icon size and the longest side), and an offset (which is used to figure out our origin coordinate when clipping the image):  if (size.width > size.height) {
   ratio = px / size.width;
   delta = (ratio*size.width - ratio*size.height);
   offset = CGPointMake(delta/2, 0);
 } else {
   ratio = px / size.height;
   delta = (ratio*size.height - ratio*size.width);
   offset = CGPointMake(0, delta/2);
 }
 Now, let's say you have an image 640px wide by 480px high, and we want to get a 50px x 50px icon out of this. The width is greater than the height, so our calculations are: ratio = 50px / 640px = 0.078125
delta = (ratio * 640px) - (ratio * 480px) = 50px - 37.5px = 12.5px
offset = {x=6.25, y=0}
 Next, I create a CGRect rect that is large enough to be cropped down to our desired icon size without distortion, plus a clipRect for clipping purposes: CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, (ratio * size.width) + delta,
                                   (ratio * size.height) + delta);
CGRect clipRect = CGRectMake(offset.x, offset.y, px, px);
 Substituting our values from above, we get: rect = origin {x=0.0, y=0.0}, size {width=62.5, height=50.0}
clipRect = origin {x=6.25, y=0}, size {width=50.0, height=50.0}
 So now we have a 62.5px wide by 50px high rect to work with, and a clipping rectangle that grabs the "middle" 50x50 portion. On to the home stretch! Next, we set up our image context, draw the UIImage (called myImage here) into the rect, set the clipping rectangle, get the (presumably now-clipped) image, use it, and finally clean up our image context:  UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(rect.size);
 [myImage drawInRect:rect]; 
 UIRectClip(clipRect);
 UIImage *icon = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();

 // Do something with the icon here ...

 UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
 Only one problem: The clipping never occurs! I end up with an image 63px wide x 50px high. :( Perhaps I'm misusing/misunderstanding UIRectClip? I've tried shuffling various things around: swapping the use of rect and clipRect, moving UIRectClip before drawInRect:. No dice. I tried searching for an example of this method online as well, to no avail. For the record, UIRectClip is defined as: Modifies the current clipping path by intersecting it with the specified rectangle. Shuffling things around gets us a little bit closer: UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(clipRect.size);
UIRectClip(rect);
[myImage drawInRect:rect];
 Now we don't have distortion, but the clipped image isn't centered on the original as I expected. Still, at least the image is 50x50, though the variable names are now fouled up as a result of said shuffling. (I'll respectfully leave renaming as an exercise for the reader.)
@CODE:px size ratio delta offset if (size.width > size.height) {
   ratio = px / size.width;
   delta = (ratio*size.width - ratio*size.height);
   offset = CGPointMake(delta/2, 0);
 } else {
   ratio = px / size.height;
   delta = (ratio*size.height - ratio*size.width);
   offset = CGPointMake(0, delta/2);
 } ratio = 50px / 640px = 0.078125
delta = (ratio * 640px) - (ratio * 480px) = 50px - 37.5px = 12.5px
offset = {x=6.25, y=0} rect clipRect CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, (ratio * size.width) + delta,
                                   (ratio * size.height) + delta);
CGRect clipRect = CGRectMake(offset.x, offset.y, px, px); rect = origin {x=0.0, y=0.0}, size {width=62.5, height=50.0}
clipRect = origin {x=6.25, y=0}, size {width=50.0, height=50.0} myImage UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(rect.size);

@TITLE:Hibernate c3p0 connection pool not timing out idle connections
@CONTENT:We have a java server connecting to a MySQL 5 database usingHibernate as our persistence layer which is using c3p0 for DB connection pooling. I've tried following the c3p0 and hibernate documentation: Hibernate - HowTo Configure c3p0 connection pool C3P0 Hibernate properties C3P0.properties configuration We're getting an error on our production servers stating that: ... Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLNonTransientConnectionException: No operations allowed after connection closed.Connection was implicitly closed due to underlying exception/error: BEGIN NESTED EXCEPTION com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException MESSAGE: The last packet successfully received from the server was45000 seconds ago.The last packet sent successfully to the server was 45000 seconds ago, which is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. STACKTRACE: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was45000 seconds ago.The last packet sent successfully to the server was 45000 seconds ago, which is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. We have our c3p0 connection pool properties setup as follows: hibernate.c3p0.max_size=10
hibernate.c3p0.min_size=1
hibernate.c3p0.timeout=5000
hibernate.c3p0.idle_test_period=300
hibernate.c3p0.max_statements=100
hibernate.c3p0.acquire_increment=2
 The default MySQL wait_timetout is set to 28800 seconds (8 hours), the reported error is saying that it's been over 45000 seconds (about 12.5 hours). Although the c3p0 configuration states that it will "timeout" idle connections that haven't been used after 5000 seconds and it will check every 300 seconds, thus an idle connection should never live longer than 5299 seconds right? I've tested locally by setting my developer MySQL (my.ini on windows, my.cnf on Unix) wait_timeout=60 and lowering the c3p0 idle timeout values below 60 seconds, and it will properly timeout idle connections and create new ones. I also check to ensure that we're not leaking DB connections and holding onto a connection, and it doesn't appear we are. Here's the c3p0.properties file I'm using to test in my developer environment to ensure c3p0 is properly handling connections. *hibernate.properties (testing with MySQL wait_timeout=60)* hibernate.c3p0.max_size=10

   <del class=\"differ\">time </del>the <del class=\"differ\">men </del>time

 Note how the words are diffed on a per word basis? I'd like some way of diffing more by phrase, so the above code output: => "now <del class=\"differ\">some time the men</del><ins class=\"differ\">is
   the</ins> time when all good men."
 Am I hoping for too much?

@TITLE:Are SQL Server 2008 Spatial Data features useful for mapping queries?
@CONTENT:I have an app where basically I have a huge table (100 million records) of information, with each row containing a lat/long value. I'm constantly querying this table to get all the records that fit within a radius around a certain point. For example, "all records within 5 miles of 39.89288,-104.919434" For this, I have an index over the Lat/Long columns, and I'm getting the "bounding square" of points, and then discarding all the points that fall outside of the circle in my ASP.Net app, since that was faster than doing the circle calculation in SQL Server. NOTE: This is all data about the US, so I'm considering the earth to be flat for my calculations, which is precise enough for my needs. Now, the main problem with the Lat/Long index is that being "a square" of points, and since i'm trying to find "Lat between x and y" and "Long between x and y", it can't really use the index super-efficiently, as it could if I were searching over "a line" of points. I've been reading up on SQL 2008's spatial features, but I haven't found enough concrete information to know whether this is useful for me. So the question is: Does SQL 2008 have some kind of different type of index that will make this specific type of query much faster than I can with SQL 2005?

@TITLE:Proper use of UIRectClip to scale a UIImage down to icon size
@CONTENT:Given a UIImage of any dimension, I wish to generate a square "icon" sized version, px pixels to a side, without any distortion (stretching). However, I'm running into a little snag. Not quite sure where the problem is. Here's what I'm doing so far. First, given a UImage size, I determine three things: the ratio to use when scaling down the image; a delta (the difference between our desired icon size and the longest side), and an offset (which is used to figure out our origin coordinate when clipping the image):  if (size.width > size.height) {
   ratio = px / size.width;
   delta = (ratio*size.width - ratio*size.height);
   offset = CGPointMake(delta/2, 0);
 } else {
   ratio = px / size.height;
   delta = (ratio*size.height - ratio*size.width);
   offset = CGPointMake(0, delta/2);
 }
 Now, let's say you have an image 640px wide by 480px high, and we want to get a 50px x 50px icon out of this. The width is greater than the height, so our calculations are: ratio = 50px / 640px = 0.078125
delta = (ratio * 640px) - (ratio * 480px) = 50px - 37.5px = 12.5px
offset = {x=6.25, y=0}
 Next, I create a CGRect rect that is large enough to be cropped down to our desired icon size without distortion, plus a clipRect for clipping purposes: CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, (ratio * size.width) + delta,
                                   (ratio * size.height) + delta);
CGRect clipRect = CGRectMake(offset.x, offset.y, px, px);
 Substituting our values from above, we get: rect = origin {x=0.0, y=0.0}, size {width=62.5, height=50.0}
clipRect = origin {x=6.25, y=0}, size {width=50.0, height=50.0}
 So now we have a 62.5px wide by 50px high rect to work with, and a clipping rectangle that grabs the "middle" 50x50 portion. On to the home stretch! Next, we set up our image context, draw the UIImage (called myImage here) into the rect, set the clipping rectangle, get the (presumably now-clipped) image, use it, and finally clean up our image context:  UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(rect.size);
 [myImage drawInRect:rect]; 
 UIRectClip(clipRect);
 UIImage *icon = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();

 // Do something with the icon here ...

 UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
 Only one problem: The clipping never occurs! I end up with an image 63px wide x 50px high. :( Perhaps I'm misusing/misunderstanding UIRectClip? I've tried shuffling various things around: swapping the use of rect and clipRect, moving UIRectClip before drawInRect:. No dice. I tried searching for an example of this method online as well, to no avail. For the record, UIRectClip is defined as: Modifies the current clipping path by intersecting it with the specified rectangle. Shuffling things around gets us a little bit closer: UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(clipRect.size);
UIRectClip(rect);
[myImage drawInRect:rect];
 Now we don't have distortion, but the clipped image isn't centered on the original as I expected. Still, at least the image is 50x50, though the variable names are now fouled up as a result of said shuffling. (I'll respectfully leave renaming as an exercise for the reader.)
@CODE:px size ratio delta offset if (size.width > size.height) {
   ratio = px / size.width;
   delta = (ratio*size.width - ratio*size.height);
   offset = CGPointMake(delta/2, 0);
 } else {
   ratio = px / size.height;
   delta = (ratio*size.height - ratio*size.width);
   offset = CGPointMake(0, delta/2);
 } ratio = 50px / 640px = 0.078125
delta = (ratio * 640px) - (ratio * 480px) = 50px - 37.5px = 12.5px
offset = {x=6.25, y=0} rect clipRect CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, (ratio * size.width) + delta,
                                   (ratio * size.height) + delta);
CGRect clipRect = CGRectMake(offset.x, offset.y, px, px); rect = origin {x=0.0, y=0.0}, size {width=62.5, height=50.0}

@TITLE:Hibernate c3p0 connection pool not timing out idle connections
@CONTENT:We have a java server connecting to a MySQL 5 database usingHibernate as our persistence layer which is using c3p0 for DB connection pooling. I've tried following the c3p0 and hibernate documentation: Hibernate - HowTo Configure c3p0 connection pool C3P0 Hibernate properties C3P0.properties configuration We're getting an error on our production servers stating that: ... Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLNonTransientConnectionException: No operations allowed after connection closed.Connection was implicitly closed due to underlying exception/error: BEGIN NESTED EXCEPTION com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException MESSAGE: The last packet successfully received from the server was45000 seconds ago.The last packet sent successfully to the server was 45000 seconds ago, which is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. STACKTRACE: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was45000 seconds ago.The last packet sent successfully to the server was 45000 seconds ago, which is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. We have our c3p0 connection pool properties setup as follows: hibernate.c3p0.max_size=10
hibernate.c3p0.min_size=1
hibernate.c3p0.timeout=5000
hibernate.c3p0.idle_test_period=300
hibernate.c3p0.max_statements=100
hibernate.c3p0.acquire_increment=2
 The default MySQL wait_timetout is set to 28800 seconds (8 hours), the reported error is saying that it's been over 45000 seconds (about 12.5 hours). Although the c3p0 configuration states that it will "timeout" idle connections that haven't been used after 5000 seconds and it will check every 300 seconds, thus an idle connection should never live longer than 5299 seconds right? I've tested locally by setting my developer MySQL (my.ini on windows, my.cnf on Unix) wait_timeout=60 and lowering the c3p0 idle timeout values below 60 seconds, and it will properly timeout idle connections and create new ones. I also check to ensure that we're not leaking DB connections and holding onto a connection, and it doesn't appear we are. Here's the c3p0.properties file I'm using to test in my developer environment to ensure c3p0 is properly handling connections. *hibernate.properties (testing with MySQL wait_timeout=60)* hibernate.c3p0.max_size=10

 Note how the words are diffed on a per word basis? I'd like some way of diffing more by phrase, so the above code output: => "now <del class=\"differ\">some time the men</del><ins class=\"differ\">is

@TITLE:Are SQL Server 2008 Spatial Data features useful for mapping queries?
@CONTENT:I have an app where basically I have a huge table (100 million records) of information, with each row containing a lat/long value. I'm constantly querying this table to get all the records that fit within a radius around a certain point. For example, "all records within 5 miles of 39.89288,-104.919434" For this, I have an index over the Lat/Long columns, and I'm getting the "bounding square" of points, and then discarding all the points that fall outside of the circle in my ASP.Net app, since that was faster than doing the circle calculation in SQL Server. NOTE: This is all data about the US, so I'm considering the earth to be flat for my calculations, which is precise enough for my needs. Now, the main problem with the Lat/Long index is that being "a square" of points, and since i'm trying to find "Lat between x and y" and "Long between x and y", it can't really use the index super-efficiently, as it could if I were searching over "a line" of points. I've been reading up on SQL 2008's spatial features, but I haven't found enough concrete information to know whether this is useful for me. So the question is: Does SQL 2008 have some kind of different type of index that will make this specific type of query much faster than I can with SQL 2005?

I'm not complaining; I understand there are complexities and a wide audience to support with web development, but I am perplexed by how long it takes to do what seems should be the easy part compared to how long it takes to write the code with complex logic, math, science, etc. Question What are you thoughts and personal experience to go from concept to reality with web development and to do this rapidly, or at least in a way that you can have a sense of how long it might take? I have purposefully not mentioned any frameworks or languages, because I would really like to here what web development stacks you use, what tools or best practices help you get things done faster, and how you end up with code that doesn't feel totally brittle and full of hacks.

@CONTENT:I'm hoping someone can help me - I'm using JBoss 5.1 and MQ Series 7 in an EJB / JMS based application. I have several message driven beans in my application, each listening on an MQ Series message queue. When an error is encountered during the processing of a message, I need to be able to configure a 'retry delay', so that mq series waits some period of time before attempting to redeliver the message. I have combed through MQ Series documentation extensively, and have not yet found a way to accomplish this in MQ Series. I know that the JBoss default JMS provider has a way to do this, but I am currently limited to using MQ Series. Since I haven't been able to set a retry delay - when I have a message that fails, my application gets stuck in a tight loop of delivering the message and rolling back continuously. Can anyone help me understand if there is some config option in MQ Series that will allow me to wait X milliseconds before redelivering a failed message?

I've looked into JRuby and seen several examples of Java applications that would be able to eval() ruby code, but is there a more elegant solution allowing to simply code everything in ruby and then compile the lot directly to a JAR file? The overall goal behind that is to be able to extend a security tool called Burp Proxy. So I'd like to be able to use all my Ruby pentesting scripts (obviously organising them so they interface with Burp extender) and compile my plugins to JAR file that can be executed by the tool. If you could include some examples or links to examples in your answer that would even be better! Thanks for your time.

@TITLE:Realtime microphone sound level monitoring
@CONTENT:I'm trying to access sound volume data from the microphone in realtime. I've tried AVAudioPlayer but it only monitors sounds from a source like an mp3 and not from a microphone. I've also tried The SpeakHere app but it's proving to be much tougher to understand with all the Objective C++ syntax (i'm a newbie). Is there another class similiar to the one in SpeakHere but written only in Objective C?

@TITLE:Does openGL ES have a better performance than Core Animation and UIKit when it comes to highly animated user interfaces?
@CONTENT:Currently I have an user interface that makes incredible heavy use of core animation. I wonder if it is worth to spent another 2 months for learning openGL ES? Does that really improve drawing performance for 2D surfaces? I have no 3D objects, but highly animated 2D stuff. Sometimes with 3D distortions, a lot of rotations and scaling. In particular I made a whole game with lots of sprites just using CA. Performance is ok but not perfect.

@TITLE:.NET OCRing an Image
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use MODI to OCR a window's program. It works fine for screenshots I grab programmatically using win32 interop like this: public string SaveScreenShotToFile()
{
    RECT rc;
    GetWindowRect(_hWnd, out rc);

    int width = rc.right - rc.left;
    int height = rc.bottom - rc.top;

    Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(width, height);
    Graphics gfxBmp = Graphics.FromImage(bmp);
    IntPtr hdcBitmap = gfxBmp.GetHdc();

    PrintWindow(_hWnd, hdcBitmap, 0);

    gfxBmp.ReleaseHdc(hdcBitmap);
    gfxBmp.Dispose();

    string fileName = @"c:\temp\screenshots\" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".bmp";
    bmp.Save(fileName);
    return fileName;
}
 This image is then saved to a file and ran through MODI like this:     private string GetTextFromImage(string fileName)
    {

        MODI.Document doc = new MODI.DocumentClass();
        doc.Create(fileName);
        doc.OCR(MODI.MiLANGUAGES.miLANG_ENGLISH, true, true);
        MODI.Image img = (MODI.Image)doc.Images[0];
        MODI.Layout layout = img.Layout;

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < layout.Words.Count; i++)
        {
            MODI.Word word = (MODI.Word)layout.Words[i];
            sb.Append(word.Text);
            sb.Append(" ");
        }

        if (sb.Length > 1)
            sb.Length--;

        return sb.ToString();
    }
 This part works fine, however, I don't want to OCR the entire screenshot, just portions of it. I try cropping the image programmatically like this:     private string SaveToCroppedImage(Bitmap original)
    {
        Bitmap result = original.Clone(new Rectangle(0, 0, 250, 250), original.PixelFormat);
        var fileName = "c:\\" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".bmp";
        result.Save(fileName, original.RawFormat);

        return fileName;
    }
 and then OCRing this smaller image, however MODI throws an exception; 'OCR running error', the error code is -959967087. Why can MODI handle the original bitmap but not the smaller version taken from it?
@CODE:public string SaveScreenShotToFile()
{
    RECT rc;
    GetWindowRect(_hWnd, out rc);

    int width = rc.right - rc.left;
    int height = rc.bottom - rc.top;

    Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(width, height);
    Graphics gfxBmp = Graphics.FromImage(bmp);
    IntPtr hdcBitmap = gfxBmp.GetHdc();

    PrintWindow(_hWnd, hdcBitmap, 0);

    gfxBmp.ReleaseHdc(hdcBitmap);
    gfxBmp.Dispose();

    string fileName = @"c:\temp\screenshots\" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".bmp";
    bmp.Save(fileName);
    return fileName;
} private string GetTextFromImage(string fileName)
    {

        MODI.Document doc = new MODI.DocumentClass();
        doc.Create(fileName);
        doc.OCR(MODI.MiLANGUAGES.miLANG_ENGLISH, true, true);
        MODI.Image img = (MODI.Image)doc.Images[0];
        MODI.Layout layout = img.Layout;

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < layout.Words.Count; i++)
        {
            MODI.Word word = (MODI.Word)layout.Words[i];
            sb.Append(word.Text);
            sb.Append(" ");
        }

        if (sb.Length > 1)
            sb.Length--;

@TITLE:When should one try to eliminate a switch statement? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Is Switch (Case) always wrong? 9 answers I've come across a switch statement in the codebase I'm working on and I'm trying to figure out how to replace it with something better since switch statements are considered a code smell. However, having read through several posts on stackoverflow about replacing switch statements I can't seem to think of an effective way to replace this particular switch statement. Its left me wondering if this particular switch statement is ok and if there are particular circumstances where switch statements are considered appropriate. In my case the code (slightly obfuscated naturally) that I'm struggling with is like this: private MyType DoSomething(IDataRecord reader)
{
    var p = new MyType
                {
                   Id = (int)reader[idIndex],
                   Name = (string)reader[nameIndex]
                }

    switch ((string) reader[discountTypeIndex])
    {
        case "A":
            p.DiscountType = DiscountType.Discountable;
            break;
        case "B":
            p.DiscountType = DiscountType.Loss;
            break;
        case "O":
            p.DiscountType = DiscountType.Other;
            break;
    }

    return p;
}
 Can anyone suggest a way to eliminate this switch? Or is this an appropriate use of a switch? And if it is, are there other appropriate uses for switch statements? I'd really like to know where they are appropriate so I don't waste too much time trying to eliminate every switch statement I come across just because they are considered a smell in some circumstances. Update: At the suggestion of Michael I did a bit of searching for duplication of this logic and discovered that someone had created logic in another class that effectively made the whole switch statement redundant. So in the context of this particular bit of code the switch statement was unnecessary. However, my question is more about the appropriateness of switch statements in code and whether we should always try to replace them whenever they are found so in this case I'm inclined to accept the answer that this switch statement is appropriate.
@CODE:private MyType DoSomething(IDataRecord reader)
{
    var p = new MyType
                {
                   Id = (int)reader[idIndex],
                   Name = (string)reader[nameIndex]
                }

    switch ((string) reader[discountTypeIndex])
    {
        case "A":
            p.DiscountType = DiscountType.Discountable;
            break;
        case "B":
            p.DiscountType = DiscountType.Loss;
            break;
        case "O":
            p.DiscountType = DiscountType.Other;
            break;
    }

    return p;

@TITLE:How to get unused memory back from the large object heap LOH from multiple managed apps?
@CONTENT:While talking to a colleague about a particular group of apps using up nearly 1.5G memory on startup... he pointed me to a very good link on .NET production debugging The part that has me puzzled is ... For example, if you allocate 1 MB of memory to a single block, the large object heap expands to 1 MB in size. When you free this object, the large object heap does not decommit the virtual memory, so the heap stays at 1 MB in size. If you allocate another 500-KB block later, the new block is allocated within the 1 MB block of memory belonging to the large object heap. During the process lifetime, the large object heap always grows to hold all the large block allocations currently referenced, but never shrinks when objects are released, even if a garbage collection occurs. Figure 2.4 on the next page shows an example of a large object heap. Now let's say we have a fictional app that creates a flurry of large objects ( > 85KB), so the large object heap grows lets say to 200 Meg. Now lets say we have 10 such app instances running.. so that 2000 Megs allocated. Now is this memory never given back to the OS until the process shuts down... (is what I understood) Are there any gaps in my understanding? How do we get back unused memory in the various LOHeaps ; we don't create the perfect storm of OutOfMemoryExceptions ? Update: From Marc's response, I wanted to clarify that the LOH objects are not referenced - the large objects are use-n-throw - however the heap doesn't shrink even though the heap is relatively empty post the initial surge. Update#2: Just including a code snippet (exaggerated but gets the point across I think).. I see an OutOfMemoryException around the time the Virtual memory hits the 1.5G mark on my machine (1.7G on another).. From Eric L.'s blog post, 'process memory can be visualized as a massive file on disk..' - this result is thus unexpected. The machines in this instance had GBs of free space on the HDD.

@TITLE:How to find a memory leak in C++
@CONTENT:What would be a good way to detect a C++ memory leak in an embedded environment? I tried overloading the new operator to log every data allocation, but I must have done something wrong, that approach isn't working. Has anyone else run into a similar situation? This is the code for the new and delete operator overloading. EDIT: Full disclosure: I am looking for a memory leak in my program and I am using this code that someone else wrote to overload the new and delete operator. Part of my problem is the fact that I don't fully understand what it does. I know that the goal is to log the address of the caller and previous caller, the size of the allocation, a 1 if we are allocating, a 2 if we are deallocation. plus the name of the thread that is running. Thanks for all the suggestions, I am going to try a different approach that someone here at work suggested. If it works, I will post it here. Thanks again to all you first-rate programmers for taking the time to answer. StackOverflow rocks! Conclusion Thanks for all the answers. Unfortunately, I had to move on to a different more pressing issue. This leak only occurred under a highly unlikely scenario. I feel crappy about just dropping it, I may go back to it if I have more time. I chose the answer I am most likely to use. #include <stdlib.h>

@TITLE:Merging from branch to trunk with 'Merge range of revisions'
@CONTENT:I have merged in Subversion/TortoiseSVN like this a few times: Method A: 1) I change the trunk and commit. 2) I make other changes in a branch and commit. 3) In a working copy from trunk: I merge from the branch using TortoiseSVN's 'Merge a range of revisions'. 4) Then I commit the trunk and delete the branch. However, the TortoiseSVN-manual recommends the following instead of 3) and 4): Method B: 3*) In a working copy from the branch: Merge changes from trunk using TortoiseSVN's 'Merge a range of revisions'. 4*) Commit the branch including trunk changes. 5*) In a working copy from the trunk: Merge changes from the branch using TortoiseSVN's 'Reintegrate a branch'. 6*) Commit the trunk and delete the branch. I find A much easier and have not found a reason why I shouldn't do it like that. What are the arguments for method B, or A, when merging from a branch back to the trunk?

@CONTENT:I want to write a program to find the roots of the quadratic equation in Scheme. I used LET for certain bindings. (define roots-with-let

          (2a (* 2 a))

 I defined the discriminant with 4ac since I did not want (* 4 a c). Even though I have defined (4ac (* 4 a c)), it is giving me this error: expand: unbound identifier in module in: 4ac. My question is how is let evaluated (what order)? And if i want 4ac in my let should i write another inner let? Is there a better way to do this?

@TITLE:How to detect cross thread access in .NET (enforce thread affinity)?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a special data structure that will be available in a .NET library and one of the features of this data structure is that is will be thread safe provided that only one thread writes data to it, and only one thread reads data from it (the reader thread and the writer thread can be different). The question is how can I enforce that all Read operations are executed by the same thread? My solution would be capture the System.Threading.Thread.ManagedThreadID and store it in a private member upon the first Read. Then, on subsequent reads to check the ManagedThreadID against the saved one and if they are different to throw an exception. Is that enough, or is there a different more reliable mechanism for doing this. Note: There is a requirement that this library be usable without a Windows.Forms context..

@TITLE:Daemonizing python's BaseHTTPServer
@CONTENT:I am working on a daemon where I need to embed a HTTP server. I am attempting to do it with BaseHTTPServer, which when I run it in the foreground, it works fine, but when I try and fork the daemon into the background, it stops working. My main application continues to work, but BaseHTTPServer does not. I believe this has something to do with the fact that BaseHTTPServer sends log data to STDOUT and STDERR. I am redirecting those to files. Here is the code snippet: # Start the HTTP Server
server = HTTPServer((config['HTTPServer']['listen'],config['HTTPServer']['port']),HTTPHandler)

# Fork our process to detach if not told to stay in foreground

@TITLE:Honoring exit codes from batch files invoked by msbuild
@CONTENT:I have a batch file that is using the exit command to return an exit code. This batch file may, in some cases, be invoked interactively from a commandline, or in other cases, may be run as part of an MSBuild project, using the Exec task. If I use exit %errorlevel% within my batch file this works well and MSBuild sees the error code, however an interactive user who is running the batch file from a command window will get a rude exit of cmd.exe in this case. If I use exit /b %errorlevel% the interactive scenario does not get a rude exit, but this also means that the cmd launched by my Exec task also does not exit, and therefore MSBuild does not see the return value. As a solution to both problems, I am trying to use exit /b but launch the batch file from my build script like this: <Exec Command="Batch.cmd params &amp; exit %errorlevel%" />
 The idea being that I explicitly take the 'non-terminal' return from exit /b and manually call exit to propogate this value outside of cmd.exe where the Exec Build Task can see it. This seems like the perfect solution, however it isn't working. Exec still doesn't get the correct error value.

@TITLE:Is the ANTLR parser generator best for a C++ app with constrained memory?
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a good parser generator that I can use to read a custom text-file format in our large commercial app. Currently this particular file format is read with a handmade recursive parser but the format has grown and complexified to the point where that approach has become unmanageable. It seems like the ultimate solution would be to build a proper grammar for this format and then use a real parser generator like yacc to read it, but I'm having trouble deciding which such generator to use or even if they're worth the trouble at all. I've looked at ANTLR and Spirit, but our project has specific constraints beyond earlier answers that make me wonder if they're as appropriate for us. In particular, I need: A parser that generates C or C++ code with MSVC. ANTLR 3 doesn't support C++; it claims to generate straight C but the docs on getting it to actually work are sort of confusing. Severely constrained memory usage. Memory is at a huge premium in our app and even tiny leaks are fatal. I need to be able to override the parser's memory allocator to use our custom malloc(), or at the very least I need to give it a contiguous pool from which it draws all its memory (and which I can deallocate en bloc afterwards). I can spare about 200kb for the parser executable itself, but whatever dynamic heap it allocates in parsing has to get freed afterwards. Good performance. This is less critical but we ought to be able to parse 100kb of text in no more than a second on a 3ghz processor. Must be GPL-free. We can't use GNU code. I like ANTLRworks' IDE and debugging tools, but it looks like getting its C target to actually work with our app will be a huge undertaking. Before I embark on that palaver, is ANTLR the right tool for this job? The text format in question looks something like: attribute "FluxCapacitance"  real constant

asset DeLorean
{
    //comment foo bar baz
    model "delorean.mdl"
    animation "gullwing.anm"

@CONTENT:I have some linq queries that have redundancy I'd like to factor out a single piece of code. These are join experssions that are IQueryable, and its important I don't cause the query to be evaluated earlier than it would be without the refactoring. Here is a simplified query: var result = 
from T in db.Transactions
join O in db.Orders on T.OrderID equals O.OrderID

 What I want to factor out is th logic "given an order, what is the first product bought". I am using the same logic in other queries. How can I factor it out into a shared method? Generally, for code reuse and IQueryables, what I've been able to do is code that takes an IQueryable going in and produces an IQueryable/IOrderedQueryable as output. With such functions I can build up LINQ expressions with reusable code that still defer query until the query is fully constructed. Here, since I only have an int (the orderID) I'm not sure how to make it work. thanks

@TITLE:Can this code be optimised?
@CONTENT:I have some image processing code that loops through 2 multi-dimensional byte arrays (of the same size). It takes a value from the source array, performs a calculation on it and then stores the result in another array. int xSize = ResultImageData.GetLength(0);
int ySize = ResultImageData.GetLength(1);

for (int x = 0; x < xSize; x++)
{                
   for (int y = 0; y < ySize; y++) 
   {                                                
      ResultImageData[x, y] = (byte)((CurrentImageData[x, y] * AlphaValue) +
                                    (AlphaImageData[x, y] * OneMinusAlphaValue));
   }
}
 The loop currently takes ~11ms, which I assume is mostly due to accessing the byte arrays values as the calculation is pretty simple (2 multiplications and 1 addition). Is there anything I can do to speed this up? It is a time critical part of my program and this code gets called 80-100 times per second, so any speed gains, however small will make a difference. Also at the moment xSize = 768 and ySize = 576, but this will increase in the future. Update: Thanks to Guffa (see answer below), the following code saves me 4-5ms per loop. Although it is unsafe code. int size = ResultImageData.Length;
int counter = 0;
unsafe
{
    fixed (byte* r = ResultImageData, c = CurrentImageData, a = AlphaImageData)
    {
        while (size > 0)
        {
            *(r + counter) = (byte)(*(c + counter) * AlphaValue + 
                                    *(a + counter) * OneMinusAlphaValue);
            counter++;
            size--;
        }
    }
}
@CODE:int xSize = ResultImageData.GetLength(0);
int ySize = ResultImageData.GetLength(1);

for (int x = 0; x < xSize; x++)
{                
   for (int y = 0; y < ySize; y++) 
   {

@TITLE:Storing a list of arbitrary objects in C++
@CONTENT:In Java, you can have a List of Objects. You can add objects of multiple types, then retrieve them, check their type, and perform the appropriate action for that type. For example: (apologies if the code isn't exactly correct, I'm going from memory) List<Object> list = new LinkedList<Object>();

list.add("Hello World!");
list.add(7);
list.add(true);

for (object o : list)
{
    if (o instanceof int)
        ; // Do stuff if it's an int
    else if (o instanceof String)
        ; // Do stuff if it's a string
    else if (o instanceof boolean)
        ; // Do stuff if it's a boolean
}
 What's the best way to replicate this behavior in C++?

list.add("Hello World!");
list.add(7);
list.add(true);

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC controller actions design
@CONTENT:I really like the way ASP.NET MVC works. I'd love to implement it on all new web projects moving forward, but I hit a snag in a prototype the other day that I really haven't found a good solution for, so I ask you, how would you design an MVC app that doesn't fit the typical REST pattern? As an example, the prototype I was designing would have several pages, but the pages themselves aren't necessarily bound to a domain model. For example, take a simple registration site, which might have the following pages: /Default.aspx /Register.aspx /ThankYou.aspx Occasionally, such a program might require an admin section to deal with such details as moderating sign ups or reviewing data. In a standard ASP.NET web app, I might add the following /Admin/Default.aspx /Admin/ListRegistrations.aspx /Admin/ViewReports.aspx ... Would it be an unacceptable deviation from the MVC pattern, in this case, to have two controllers such as: Home->Index Home->Register Home->ThankYou Admin->Index Admin->ListRegistrations Admin->Reports My frustration with this is compounded by the fact that there is no real solid implementation of subcontrollers and areas yet. I'm aware of the "Areas" prototype put together by Phil Haack, but it's not very mature, and quite frankly, I'm not sure I like the way it's setup, but I don't really know how I'd like to see that work either. I guess when I think MVC, I tend to think REST as well, and having controller actions that represent pages rather than actual entities or actions doesn't sit right with me. What do you think?

@TITLE:WPF ListView Databound Drag/Drop Auto Scroll
@CONTENT:I've been working with Bea's solution here for a while and finding it very helpful. Problem now I'm having is when I drag-n-drop items within or to another ListView control and I want to scroll up/down "during" the drag (moving an item from index 30 to index 1), it's not happening. I would have to drag to the top of the visual items in the ListView, manually scroll up, then drag again, eventually ending at the position I want. This isn't very user friendly. Now I found the function (DragDropHelper.DropTarget_PreviewDragOver) that I would want to do the testing of which item is being dragged over, and I'm getting that. Dim pt As Point = e.GetPosition(DirectCast(Me.targetItemsControl, UIElement))

' Perform the hit test against a given portion of the visual object tree.
Dim result As HitTestResult = VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(Me.targetItemsControl, pt)
 Now from there I can get the DependencyProperty of this visual hit Dim lvi As ListViewItem = TryCast(GetDependencyObjectFromVisualTree(TryCast(result.VisualHit, DependencyObject), GetType(ListViewItem)), ListViewItem)
 Which is of a ListViewItem. Now in the function DropTarget_PreviewDragOver I have the "DraggedItem" which is of type Picture in Bea's example, but that can change depending on the ObservableCollection you have bound to the ListView. Now, I want to drag the ListView up or down depending on where the mouse is on the control. I've attempted with the below un-finished non-working code If lvi IsNot Nothing Then
    If pt.Y <= 25 Then
        Dim lv As ListView = TryCast(targetItemsControl, ListView)
        If lv IsNot Nothing Then
            Dim index As Integer = lv.Items.IndexOf(lvi)
            If index > 1 Then
                lv.ScrollIntoView(lv.Items(index - 1))
            End If
        End If
    Else
        If pt.Y >= Me.targetItemsControl.ActualHeight - 25 Then
            Debug.Print("Scroll Down")
        End If

@LINK:/questions/556580/servicecontainer-ioc-and-disposable-objects
@TITLE:ServiceContainer, IoC, and disposable objects
@CONTENT:I have a question, and I'm going to tag this subjective since that's what I think it evolves into, more of a discussion. I'm hoping for some good ideas or some thought-provokers. I apologize for the long-winded question but you need to know the context. The question is basically: How do you deal with concrete types in relation to IoC containers? Specifically, who is responsible for disposing them, if they require disposal, and how does that knowledge get propagated out to the calling code? Do you require them to be IDisposable? If not, is that code future-proof, or is the rule that you cannot use disposable objects? If you enforce IDisposable-requirements on interfaces and concrete types to be future-proof, whose responsibility is objects injected as part of constructor calls? Edit: I accepted the answer by @Chris Ballard since it's the closest one to the approach we ended up with. Basically, we always return a type that looks like this: public interface IService<T> : IDisposable
    where T: class
{
    T Instance { get; }
    Boolean Success { get; }
    String FailureMessage { get; } // in case Success=false
}
 We then return an object implementing this interface back from both .Resolve and .TryResolve, so that what we get in the calling code is always the same type. Now, the object implementing this interface, IService<T> is IDisposable, and should always be disposed of. It's not up to the programmer that resolves a service to decide whether the IService<T> object should be disposed or not. However, and this is the crucial part, whether the service instance should be disposed or not, that knowledge is baked into the object implementing IService<T>, so if it's a factory-scoped service (ie. each call to Resolve ends up with a new service instance), then the service instance will be disposed when the IService<T> object is disposed. This also made it possible to support other special scopes, like pooling. We can now say that we want minimum 2 service instances, maximum 15, and typically 5, which means that each call to .Resolve will either retrieve a service instance from a pool of available objects, or construct a new one. And then, when the IService<T> object that holds the pooled service is disposed of, the service instance is released back into its pool. Sure, this made all code look like this: using (var service = ServiceContainer.Global.Resolve<ISomeService>())
{
    service.Instance.DoSomething();
}
 but it's a clean approach, and it has the same syntax regardless of the type of service or concrete object in use, so we chose that as an acceptable solution. Original question follows, for posterity Long-winded question comes here: We have a IoC container that we use, and recently we discovered what amounts to a problem. In non-IoC code, when we wanted to use, say, a file, we used a class like this: using (Stream stream = new FileStream(...))
{
    ...
}
 There was no question as to whether this class was something that held a limited resource or not, since we knew that files had to be closed, and the class itself implemented IDisposable. The rule is simply that every class we construct an object of, that implements IDisposable, has to be disposed of. No questions asked. It's not up to the user of this class to decide if calling Dispose is optional or not. Ok, so on to the first step towards the IoC container. Let's assume we don't want the code to talk directly to the file, but instead go through one lay
@CODE:public interface IService<T> : IDisposable
    where T: class
{
    T Instance { get; }
    Boolean Success { get; }
    String FailureMessage { get; } // in case Success=false
} IService<T> IService<T> IService<T> IService<T> IService<T> using (var service = ServiceContainer.Global.Resolve<ISomeService>())
{
    service.Instance.DoSomething();
} using (Stream stream = new FileStream(...))
{
    ...
}

@LINK:/questions/549347/how-to-use-address-constants-in-gcc-x86-inline-assembly
@TITLE:How to use address constants in GCC x86 inline assembly
@CONTENT:The GCC toolchain uses AT&T assembler syntax by default, but support for Intel syntax is available via the .intel_syntax directive. Additionally, both AT&T and Intel syntax are available in a prefix and a noprefix version, which differ in whether or not they require to prefix register names with a % sigil. Depending on which directives are present, the format for address constants changes. Let's consider the following C code *(int *)0xdeadbeef = 0x1234;
 Using objdump -d, we find that it's compiled to the following assembler instruction movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef
 As there are no registers involved, this is the correct syntax for both .att_syntax prefix and .att_syntax noprefix, ie. embedded in C code, they look like this __asm__(".att_syntax prefix");
__asm__("movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef");

__asm__(".att_syntax noprefix");
__asm__("movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef");
 You can optionally surround the address constant with parentheses, ie. __asm__("movl $0x1234,(0xdeadbeef)");
 will work as well. When adding a sigil to a plain address constant, the code will fail to copile __asm__("movl $0x1234,$0xdeadbeef"); // won't compile
 When surrounding this expression with paranthesis, the compiler will emit wrong code without warning, ie __asm__("movl $0x1234,($0xdeadbeef)"); // doesn't warn, but doesn't work!
 This will incorrectly emit the instruction movl $0x1234,0x0
 In Intel mode, an address constant has to be prefixed with a segment register as well as the operand size and the PTR flag if ambiguity is possible. On my machine (an Intel dual core laptop with Windows XP and current MinGW and Cygwin GCC versions), the register ds is used by default. Square brackets around the constant are optional. The address constant is also correctly recognized if the segment register is omitted, but the brackets are present. Omitting the register emits a warning on my system, though. In prefix mode, the segment register has to be prefixed with %, but only using brackets will still work. These are the different ways to generate the correct instruction: __asm__(".intel_syntax noprefix");
__asm__("mov DWORD PTR ds:0xdeadbeef,0x1234");
__asm__("mov DWORD PTR ds:[0xdeadbeef],0x1234");
__asm__("mov DWORD PTR [0xdeadbeef],0x1234"); // works, but warns!

__asm__(".intel_syntax prefix");
__asm__("mov DWORD PTR %ds:0xdeadbeef,0x1234");
__asm__("mov DWORD PTR %ds:[0xdeadbeef],0x1234");
__asm__("mov DWORD PTR [0xdeadbeef],0x1234"); // works, but warns!
 Omitting both segment register and brackets will fail to compile __asm__("mov DWORD PTR 0xdeadbeef,0x1234"); // won't compile
 I'll mark this question as community wiki, so if you have anything useful to add, feel free to do so.
@CODE:.intel_syntax prefix noprefix % *(int *)0xdeadbeef = 0x1234; objdump -d movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef .att_syntax prefix .att_syntax noprefix __asm__(".att_syntax prefix");
__asm__("movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef");

__asm__(".att_syntax noprefix");

@LINK:/questions/505387/mapping-a-bidirectional-list-with-hibernate
@TITLE:Mapping a bidirectional list with Hibernate
@CONTENT:I don't understand the behavior of Hibernate when mapping a bidirectional list. The SQL statements that Hibernate produces seem not optimal to me. Can somebody enlighten me? The scenario is the following: I have a one-to-many parent-child relationship. I map this relationship with a bidirectional list. According to the Hibernate Annotation Reference Guide (Chapter: Bidirectional association with indexed collections) the mapping should look like this: @Entity
public class Parent {

    @Id  @GeneratedValue private long id;
    @Version  private int version;
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "parent_id", nullable=false)
    @org.hibernate.annotations.IndexColumn(name = "parent_index")
    List<Child> children = new ArrayList<Child>();

...

@Entity
public class Child {

    @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
    @Version private int version;
    private String name;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "parent_id", updatable = false, insertable = false, nullable=false)
    private Parent parent;

...
 But in this case Hibernate produces three SQL statements when persisting a parent with one child: Hibernate: insert into Parent (name, version, id) values (?, ?, ?)
Hibernate: insert into Child (name, price, version, parent_id, parent_index, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
Hibernate: update Child set parent_id=?, parent_index=? where id=?
 The third statement seems to be redundant, because parent_id and parent_index seem to be set already in the second statement. When I change the mapping and repeat the attributes 'updatable = false, insertable = false' to the declaration of the @JoinColumn in the Parent like this: @Entity
public class Parent {

    @Id  @GeneratedValue private long id;
    @Version  private int version;
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "parent_id", updatable = false, insertable = false, nullable=false)
    @org.hibernate.annotations.IndexColumn(name = "parent_index")
    List<Child> children = new ArrayList<Child>();

...

@Entity
public class Child {

    @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
    @Version private int version;
    private String name;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "parent_id", updatable = false, insertable = false, nullable=false)
    private Parent parent;

...
 ...then Hibernate seems to produce much more optimized SQL: Hibernate: insert into Parent (name, version, id) values (?, ?, ?)
Hibernate: insert into Child (name, price, version, parent_id, parent_index, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
 The client code looks like this:     EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("test");
    EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
    tx.begin();

    Parent newParent = new Parent();
    newParent.setName("Parent1");

    Child newChild = new Child();
    newChild.setName("Child1");

    newParent.getChildren().add(newChild);
    newChild.setParent(newParent);

    em.persist(newParent);

    em.flush();
    tx.commit();

@LINK:/questions/425618/executing-groovy-statements-in-javascript-sources-in-grails
@TITLE:Executing groovy statements in JavaScript sources in Grails
@CONTENT:There are essentially 2 places to define JavaScript functions in Grails, directly in a element on the GSP, and within a separate javascript source file under /web-app/js (for example, application.js). We have defined a commonly reused javascript function within application.js, but we also need to be able to generate parts of the function dynamically using groovy code. Unfortunately, ${some groovy code} does not appear to be processed within separate javascript source files. Is the only way to do this by defining the javascript function within a script tag on a GSP page, or is there a more general solution? Obviously we could define the javascript function in a script tag within a template GSP file which would be reused, but there is a lot of push to keep our javascript functions defined all together in one place (i.e. the external javascript source file). This has performance benefits as well (the javascript source files are usually just downloaded once by each client's browser, instead of reloading the same javascript functions within the source of every html page they visit). I have toyed around with the idea of breaking the function up into static and dynamic pieces, putting the static ones in the external source and putting the dynamic ones in the template GSP, then gluing them together, but this seems like an unnecessary hack. Any ideas? (edit: It may sound like the idea of dynamically generating parts of a JavaScript function, which is then downloaded once and used over and over again by the client, would be a bad idea. However, the piece which is "dynamic" only changes perhaps once a week or month, and then only very slightly. Mostly we just want this piece generated off the database, even if only once, instead of hard coded.)

@TITLE:REST URIs and operations on an object that can be commented on, tagged, rated, etc
@CONTENT:I'm doing research into a web API for my company, and it's starting to look like we might implement a RESTful one. I've read a couple of books about this now (O'Reilly's "RESTful web services" seeming the most useful) and have come up with the following set of URIs and operations for an object that can be commented on, tagged, and rated. It doesn't really matter what the object is, as this scenario applies to many things on the net, but for the sake of argument lets say it's a movie. Some of these seem to fit quite naturally, but others seem a bit forced (rating and tagging particularly) so does anybody have any suggestions about how these could be improved? I'll list them with the URI and then the supported verbs, and what I propose they would do. /movies
 GET = List movies /movies/5
 GET = Get movie 5 /movies/5/comments
 GET = List comments on movie 5 POST = Create a new comment on movie 5 /movies/5/comments/8
 GET = Get comment 8 on movie 5 POST = Reply to comment 8 on movie 5 PUT = Update comment 8 on movie 5 /movies/5/comments/8/flag
 GET = Check whether the movies is flagged as inappropriate (404 if not) PUT = Flag movie as inappropriate /movies/5/rating
 GET = Get the rating of the movie POST = Add the user rating of the movie to the overall rating Edit: My intention is that the movie object would contain its rating as a property, so I wouldn't really expect the GET method to be used here. The URI really exists so that the rating can be an individual resource that can be updated using the POST verb. I'm not sure if this is the best way of doing it, but I can't think of a better one /movies/5/tags/tagname
 GET = Check whether the movies is tagged with tagname (404 if not; but if it is tagged with the tag name should it return the actual tag resource by redirecting to something like /tags/tagname?) PUT = Add tag tagname to the movie, creating the tag resource /tags/tagname if required DELETE = Remove tag tagname from the movie, deleting the tag resource tags/tagname if nothing is tagged with it after this removal Note that these wouldn't be the entire URIs, for example the URI to list the movies would support filtering, paging and sorting. For this I was planning on something like: /movies/action;90s/rating,desc/20-40
 Where: action;90s is a semi-colon delimited set of filter criteria rating,desc is the sort order and direction 20-40 is the range of item indices to get Any comments about this API scheme too? Edit #1 This post is getting quite long now! After reading some of the answers and comments, this is the changes from above I'm planning on making: Tags will be handled as a group rather than individually, so they will be at: /movies/5/tags
 GET = List tags POST = Union of specified tags and existing tags PUT = Replace any current tags with specified tags DELETE = Delete all tags I'm still really not sure how to handle flagging a comment though. One option is that instead of POSTing to a comment replying to it, a comment object will include its parent so it can be POSTed to the general URI, i.e. /movie/5/comment
 POST = Create a new comment (which may be a reply to a comment) I could then use the POST to a comment to flag it. But this still doesn't feel quite right. /movie/5/comment/8
 POST = Flag comment

After seeing the answers some comment: I agree that LOC or function points are ineffective measurements I also agree that productivity is a difficult thing to measure But problem is that in a big company management asks for hard data and you cannot always believe that managers are ex topgun programmers that once delivered Excel (Hi Joel!), so you need to come up with some measures. And it's very sad that in years of experience our discipline has never come up with good solutions about measuring the success of a project or to determine which development environment (talking about tools and languages, I do not want to talk about people!) is more productive, all we have to show to managers is some blog post with real experience or some research from "organization astronauts" that talks about measure development tasks without having ever written a line of code.

@CONTENT:Was wondering if anyone knows, or has pointers to good documentation that discusses, the low-level implementation details of Cocoa's 'performSelectorOnMainThread:' method. My best guess, and one I think is probably pretty close, is that it uses mach ports or an abstraction on top of them to provide intra-thread communication, passing selector information along as part of the mach message. Right? Wrong? Thanks! Update 09:39AMPST Thank you Evan DiBiase and Mecki for the answers, but to clarify: I understand what happens in the run loop, but what I'm looking for an answer to is; "where is the method getting queued? how is the selector information getting passed into the queue?" Looking for more than Apple's doc info: I've read 'em Update 14:21PST Chris Hanson brings up a good point in a comment: my objective here is not to learn the underlying mechanisms in order to take advantage of them in my own code. Rather, I'm just interested in a better conceptual understanding of the process of signaling another thread to execute code. As I said, my own research leads me to believe that it's takes advantage of mach messaging for IPC to pass selector information between threads, but I'm specifically looking for concrete information on what is happening, so I can be sure I'm understanding things correctly.

@TITLE:How to host 2 WCF services in 1 Windows Service?
@CONTENT:I have a WCF application that has two Services that I am trying to host in a single Windows Service using net.tcp. I can run either of the services just fine, but as soon as I try to put them both in the Windows Service only the first one loads up. I have determined that the second services ctor is being called but the OnStart never fires. This tells me that WCF is finding something wrong with loading up that second service. Using net.tcp I know I need to turn on port sharing and start the port sharing service on the server. This all seems to be working properly. I have tried putting the services on different tcp ports and still no success. My service installer class looks like this:  [RunInstaller(true)]
 public class ProjectInstaller : Installer
 {
      private ServiceProcessInstaller _process;
      private ServiceInstaller        _serviceAdmin;
      private ServiceInstaller        _servicePrint;

      public ProjectInstaller()
      {
    		_process = new ServiceProcessInstaller();
    		_process.Account = ServiceAccount.LocalSystem;

    		_servicePrint = new ServiceInstaller();
    		_servicePrint.ServiceName = "PrintingService";
    		_servicePrint.StartType = ServiceStartMode.Automatic;

    		_serviceAdmin = new ServiceInstaller();
    		_serviceAdmin.ServiceName = "PrintingAdminService";
    		_serviceAdmin.StartType = ServiceStartMode.Automatic;

    		Installers.AddRange(new Installer[] { _process, _servicePrint, _serviceAdmin });
      }	  
}
 and both services looking very similar  class PrintService : ServiceBase
 {

      public ServiceHost _host = null;

      public PrintService()
      {
    		ServiceName = "PCTSPrintingService";
    		CanStop = true;
    		AutoLog = true;

      }

      protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
      {
    		if (_host != null) _host.Close();

    		_host = new ServiceHost(typeof(Printing.ServiceImplementation.PrintingService));
    		_host.Faulted += host_Faulted;

    		_host.Open();
      }
}

@TITLE:Unit testing with network-reliant code
@CONTENT:I'm trying to be better about unit testing my code, but right now I'm writing a lot of code that deals with remote systems. SNMP, WMI, that sort of thing. With most classes I can mock up objects to test them, but how do you deal with unit testing a real system? For example, if my class goes out and gets the Win32_LogicalDisk object for a server, how could I possibly unit test it?

@CONTENT:So creating a Windows service using Visual Studio is fairly trivial. My question goes a bit deeper as to what actually makes an executable installable as a service & how to write a service as a straight C application. I couldn't find a lot of references on this, but I'm presuming there has to be some interface I can implement so my .exe can be installed as a service.

@TITLE:Should compile sdk be lower than target sdk
@CONTENT:The overwhelming advice on SO is that compile SDK should usually match target SDK. http://stackoverflow.com/a/27629181/360211 Likewise it is advisable to have this [compileSdk] match you target sdk version. http://stackoverflow.com/a/28294447/360211 ... CompileSDK (usually equal to target SDk version) version. But the clear advice here is: In general, you should compile your application against the lowest possible version of the platform that your application can support. I've always made compile sdk match target sdk, but since reading that I realize that I, and many SO answers are wrong. My question is, what's the harm in making them match or conversely what's the advantage of having the lowest compile sdk version you can get away with?

@TITLE:Can I build my own networking framework (which is dependent on AFNetworking) as a watchOS2 framework?
@CONTENT:I've been trying to modify my project to support WatchOS2 architecture. Currently I have a networking framework that is based on AFNetworking. I've been using it with my watch app so far. Now I'm trying to build the framework for watchos/watchsimulator platforms. What I'm getting is 'SystemConfiguration/SystemConfiguration.h' file not found error for some AFNetworking classes. I know that system configuration is not one of the available system frameworks for watchOS2. And for networking apple says: Networking Support for network-based operations includes the following technologies: WatchKit extensions can access the network directly using an NSURLSession object. WatchKit extensions have full access to the NSURLSession capabilities, including the ability to download files in the background. For information on how to use this class, see URL Loading System Programming Guide. The Watch Connectivity framework supports bidirectional communication between your Watch app and iOS app. Use this framework to coordinate activities between the two apps. For more information, see Communicating with Your Companion iOS App. I want to support both iOS and watchos for my networking sdk. Is there a way to make this project built for watchOS platform? Or is that mean I am only allowed to use NSURLConnection inside my watch app?

@TITLE:Change NavigationView items when user is logged
@CONTENT:My app's main activity has a navigation drawer, instantiated in the XML in this way: <android.support.design.widget.NavigationView

    android:layout_gravity="start"
    app:headerLayout="@layout/drawer_header"
    app:menu="@menu/application_drawer"

 Now, the menu entry for the navigation drawer is the following: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
<group android:checkableBehavior="single">
    <item

Here is an image I drew in reference to my question: First of all, I'd like to know if this model is an accurate representation of the stack "framing" process. I know that conceptually, the stack is like a Coke bottle. The sugar is at the bottom and you fill it up to the top. With this in mind, how does the Call tell the EIP register to "target" the called function if the EIP is in another bottle (it's in the code segment, not the stack segment)? I watched a video on YouTube saying that the "Code Segment of RAM" (the place where functions are kept) is the place where the EIP register is. I'm lost.

@TITLE:ListView grid in React Native
@CONTENT:I'm building a simple app in React Native that fetches listings from a remote JSON source and displays them on screen. So far, using the excellent example here, I've managed to get the results to display using the ListView components in rows (i.e. 1 result per row, see screenshot). I need the results to display in a grid, i.e. 3 to 6 items per row, depending on the screen size and orientation. What is the best way to get these results into a grid? Can I use ListView for this, or is that only for one-per-row results? I've tried playing around with flexbox styles but, since React doesn't seem to accept % values and ListView doesn't accept styles, I haven't yet had any success.

@TITLE:Why use a templated control over a UserControl?
@CONTENT:I was looking some tutorials on how to create custom controls in WinRT, and I have a question. Let's say I want to create a simple control that contains some stuff, like a Grid with an image on the left and a couple of TextBlocks on the right. I mean, something simple like: <Grid Height="100">
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <ColumnDefinition Width="0.3*"/>
        <ColumnDefinition Width="0.7*"/>
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    <Image Source"/Assets/someRandomImage.png"/>
    <StackPanel Grid.Column="1"
                VerticalAlignment="Center">
        <TextBlock Text="Some text"
                   Margin="10,0,10,0"
                   FontSize="24"
                   FontWeight="SemiLight"
                   TextTrimming="CharacterEllipsis"/>
        <TextBlock Text="Some random description..."
                   Margin="10,5,10,0"
                   FontSize="18"
                   FontWeight="Light"
                   Foreground="Gray"
                   TextWrapping="Wrap"
                   TextTrimming="CharacterEllipsis"/>
    </StackPanel>
</Grid>
 I would create a UserControl with this content, so I'd be able to see it in the XAML Designer while I'm working on its UI, and I'd add all the Properties and DependencyProperties in the UserControl code behind. Then I saw that another approach would be to use a Template control, so I'd have to create a class that inherits from the Control class, then use the above XAML code as a template and apply it to the custom control and add all the rest of the logic there. Of course, I'd also have to add the x:Name property to some those UIElements inside the control to be able to interact with them, but you get the idea. I was wondering, is it ok to use either one of these two methods, or is better to use one in particular, and why? Also, I like using UserControls since I can see them in the Designer window, and instead I wouldn't be able to do that with a Template, I'd have to run the app and create an instance of the control to see what it actually looks like. Thanks for your help, I think I'm not the only one with this doubt, so I hope this question will help others as well :D Sergio

@LINK:/questions/28954523/yii2-ajax-form-validation-on-an-ajax-submitted-form
@TITLE:Yii2: ajax form validation on an ajax submitted form
@CONTENT:I'm wondering if any Yii2 experts can help me understand how best to work with ajax forms combined with Yii ajax validation. I think I can explain the issue without taking you through all of my code. I am working on a Promo Code entry form where the user enters their promo code into the form, the form is submit via ajax. We then perform a database lookup for the promo code details, validate the code and if the code validates, we want to display the registration form that is hidden on the page. I have a custom validation function for the form field "code", which is the active field in a model scenario named "register". class UserCode extends ActiveRecord
{
    ... 

    public function scenarios()
    {
        return [
            'register' => ['code'],
        ];
    }

    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            [['code'], 'required'],
            [['code'], 'validateUserCode', 'on' => ['register']],
        ];
    }

    public function validateUserCode($attribute, $params)
    {
        // perform all my custom logic to determine if the code is valid

        if ($code_invalid) {
            $this->addError($attribute, 'Sorry, this code is invalid.');
        }
    }

    ...
}
 Then in the controller, as the Yii2 Guide suggests, I trap this ajax validation with the following code: public function actionValidate() {

    $model = new UserCode(['scenario' => 'register']);

    if (Yii::$app->request->isAjax && $model->load(Yii::$app->request->post())) {
        Yii::$app->response->format = Response::FORMAT_JSON;
        return ActiveForm::validate($model);
    }

    // no logic can be run after the above code b/c the form is submit with ajax 
    // and therefore always trapped in the Yii::$app->request->isAjax conditional

}
 The above code all works fine and if I remove focus from the $form->field($model, 'code') field on my form, Yii's ajax validation kicks in and displays my custom error message based off of my custom validation logic. My challenge arises when I go to submit the form. The form submission is also handled through ajax, and therefore the controller action always returns the result of the ActiveForm::validate($model); because if (Yii::$app->request->isAjax && $model->load(Yii::$app->request->post())) will get apply to both the ajax form validation AND on the form submit. With the above approach, I am forced to return only the results of the ajax validation and not any json data that I may need for additional client side validation, such as displaying the registration form after a valid use code is submitted through the ajax form. I realize that I can set 'enableAjaxValidation' => false on the ActiveForm and then return my own json data inside the if (Yii::$app->request->isAjax && $model->load(Yii::$app->request->post())) condition. If I do this, I am able to show the registration form because I have my own json data to work with. Is there a way to have ajax validation on a form that is submitted with ajax? How could you trap the ajax validation separately from the ajax form submission to handle the two events in different manners? Any suggestions or alternate approaches are GREATLY appreciated!

            [['code'], 'required'],
            [['code'], 'validateUserCode', 'on' => ['register']],
        ];
    }

    public function validateUserCode($attribute, $params)
    {
        // perform all my custom logic to determine if the code is valid

        if ($code_invalid) {

@TITLE:Dynamic ui-router with ocLazyLoad using multiple modules in resolve
@CONTENT:SOLVED SEE BELOW!!! Working from this question/solution Stackoverflow question ..... I edited the original question I posted here because it is no longer worth reading. My problem was I could not find documentation on: Using dynamic angular-ui-router; That makes use of ocLazyLoad; Had nested views the main controller did not need to know anything about; And it facilitates the pursuit of building a REAL WORLD large-scale angular application comprising of a myriad of modules, many of which are simultaneously required in just one view, and again, often without the main controller of that view never needing to know anything about those nested views or how they work; And! As a bonus, allow me to add those modules used by many states in some base state, so I would never need to load them again (this does not apply to services). As example: What if I had a page, called MyDashboard, that may contain typical info on something that MyDashboard would contain. But what if I wanted to show graphs on that page, and I did not want MyDashboard controller to know about those graphs? What if I had a To-Do list that I used throughout my app and did not want MyDashboard controller to know anything about those to-dos? Is there a way I can add dependencies for nested views that MyDashboard controller need not know how they work, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HAVE DYNAMIC STATE? Is there a way I could, while creating ---DYNAMIC--- state views, just supplant those dependencies I needed for that view, often w/o the controller never needing to know anything about them? I think the below is the best solution to creating a large scale REAL WORLD, agnostic, angular app, with dependencies loaded on a "need-to-have" basis. I scoured ocombe's github for such a solution. You won't find it. I offer the below 'Ronco-Automatic' solution to the community. It slices, it dices, it peels. I hope it helps you.

@LINK:/questions/26757452/laravel-eloquent-accessing-properties-and-dynamic-table-names
@TITLE:Laravel Eloquent: Accessing properties and Dynamic Table Names
@CONTENT:I am using the Laravel Framework and this question is directly related to using Eloquent within Laravel. I am trying to make an Eloquent model that can be used across the multiple different tables. The reason for this is that I have multiple tables that are essentially identical but vary from year to year, but I do not want to duplicate code to access these different tables. gamedata_2015_nations gamedata_2015_leagues gamedata_2015_teams gamedata_2015_players I could of course have one big table with a year column, but with over 350,000 rows each year and many years to deal with I decided it would be better to split them into multiple tables, rather than 4 huge tables with an extra 'where' on each request. So what I want to do is have one class for each and do something like this within a Repository class: public static function getTeam($year, $team_id)
    {
        $team = new Team;

        $team->setYear($year);

        return $team->find($team_id);
    }
 I have used this discussion on the Laravel forums to get me started: http://laravel.io/forum/08-01-2014-defining-models-in-runtime So far I have this: class Team extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {

    protected static $year;

    public function setYear($year)
    {
        static::$year= $year;
    }

    public function getTable()
    {
        if(static::$year)
        {
            //Taken from https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.php#L1875
            $tableName = str_replace('\\', '', snake_case(str_plural(class_basename($this))));

            return 'gamedata_'.static::$year.'_'.$tableName;
        }

        return Parent::getTable();
    }
}
 This seems to work, however i'm worried it's not working in the right way. Because i'm using the static keyword the property $year is retained within the class rather than each individual object, so whenever I create a new object it still holds the $year property based on the last time it was set in a different object. I would rather $year was associated with a single object and needed to be set each time I created an object. Now I am trying to track the way that Laravel creates Eloquent models but really struggling to find the right place to do this. For instance if I change it to this: class Team extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {

    public $year;

    public function setYear($year)
    {
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    public function getTable()
    {
        if($this->year)
        {
            //Taken from https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.php#L1875
            $tableName = str_replace('\\', '', snake_case(str_plural(class_basename($this))));

            return 'gamedata_'.$this->year.'_'.$tableName;
        }

        return Parent::getTable();
    }
}
 This works just fine when trying to get a single Team. However with relationships it doesn't work. This is what i've tried with relationships: public function players()
{
    $playerModel = DataRepository::getPlayerModel(static::$year);

    return $this->hasMany($playerModel);
}

//This is in the DataRepository class
public static function getPlayerModel($year)
{
    $model = new Player;

    $model->setYear($year);

    return $model;
}
 Again this works absolutely fine if i'm using static::$year, but if I try and change it to use $this->year then this stops working. The actual error stems from the fact that $this->year is not set within getTable() so that the parent getTable() method is called and the wrong table name returned. My next step was to try and figure out why it was working with the static property but not with the nonstatic property (not sure on the right term for that). I assumed that it was simply using the static::$year from the Team class when trying to build the Player relationship. However this is not the case. If I try and force an error with something like this: public function players()
{
    //Note the hard coded 1800
    //If it was simply using the old static::$year property then I would expect this still to work
    $playerModel = DataRepository::getPlayerModel(1800);

    return $this->hasMany($playerModel);
}
 Now what happens is that I get an error saying gamedata_1800_players isn't found. Not that surprising perhaps. But it rules out the possibility that Eloquent is simply using the static::$year property from the Team class since it is clearly setting the custom year that i'm sending to the getPlayerModel() method. So now I know that when the $year is set within a relationship and is set statically then getTable() has access to it, but if it is set non-statically then it gets lost somewhere and the object doesn't know about this property by the time getTable() is called. (note the significance of it working different when simply creating a new object and when using relationships) I realise i've given alot of detail now, so to simplify and clarify my question: 1) Why does static::$year work but $this->year not work for relationships, when both work when simply creating a new object. 2) Is there a way that I can use a non static property and achieve what I am already achieving using a static property? Justification for this: The static property will stay with the class even after I have finished with one object and am trying to create another object with that class, which doesn't seem right. Example:     //Get a League from the 2015 database
    $leagueQuery = new League;

    $leagueQuery->setYear(2015);

    $league = $leagueQuery->find(11);

    //Get another league
    //EEK! I still think i'm from 2015, even though nobodies told me that!
    $league2 = League::find(12);
 This may not be the worst thing in the world, and like I said, it is actually working using the static properties with no critical errors. However it is dangerous for the above code sample to work in that way, so I would like to do it properly and avoid such a danger.
@CODE:public static function getTeam($year, $team_id)
    {
        $team = new Team;

        $team->setYear($year);

        return $team->find($team_id);
    } class Team extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {

    protected static $year;

    public function setYear($year)
    {
        static::$year= $year;
    }

    public function getTable()
    {
        if(static::$year)
        {
            //Taken from https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.php#L1875
            $tableName = str_replace('\\', '', snake_case(str_plural(class_basename($this))));

            return 'gamedata_'.static::$year.'_'.$tableName;
        }

        return Parent::getTable();
    }
} class Team extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {

    public $year;

    public function setYear($year)
    {
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    public function getTable()
    {
        if($this->year)
        {
            //Taken from https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Model.php#L1875

            return 'gamedata_'.$this->year.'_'.$tableName;
        }

        return Parent::getTable();
    }
} public function players()
{
    $playerModel = DataRepository::getPlayerModel(static::$year);

    return $this->hasMany($playerModel);
}

//This is in the DataRepository class

@LINK:/questions/26556749/binding-tab-specific-data-to-an-http-get-request
@TITLE:Binding tab-specific data to an HTTP GET request
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement an authentication mechanism where each browser tab may be logged in as a different user. Here are the rules of this system: An authentication token indicates which user is logged in. There are 2 kinds of authentication tokens: private and public. Each private token is bound to a single tab and determines its account information. The public token may be read/written to by any tab and indicates the last account that was logged into (across all tabs). When a user logs out in any tab, both the private and public tokens are removed. Each time a tab hits a page that requires authentication, the system tries reading the private token. If it is not set (as in the case of a new/blank tab), it tries copying the value of the public token into the private token. If the public token is not set then the user is redirected to an authentication screen. When a tab is already logged in and a user clicks on a link, the request must include the private token in a custom HTTP header. Sending this information in the URI is not an option, for security reasons. Ability to navigate using the back/forward button the same as you would for normal links (meaning, no prompts to re-submit form data). What I've tried so far: Using cookies for both the private and public tokens: this doesn't work because the server has no way of knowing which cookie to look in. If a user clicks on a link from inside a tab, the request sends all cookies across all tabs and the server has no way of knowing which one clicked on the link. Storing private tokens in sessionStorage: This doesn't work because when a user clicks on a link, there is no way to specify custom headers that should be sent alongside the HTTP GET request. Requesting the page using AJAX, then navigating to the page in memory using Data URIs: For security reasons, Internet Explorer doesn't allow the use of DATA URIs for HTML content. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc848897%28v=vs.85%29.aspx Using <form method="get" enctype="multipart/form-data"> and passing the token using hidden fields: enctype="multipart/form-data" is only supported for POST. Using <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"> and passing the token using hidden fields: in theory, this should work but now the user gets prompted to re-submit form data if he uses the back/forward button. Requesting the page using AJAX, then rewriting the current page using document.open(); document.write(); document.close(). I tried both http://stackoverflow.com/a/4404659/14731 and http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=5767285&sid=d6a5a2e8e311598cdbad124e277e0f52#p5767285 and in both cases the scripts in the new <head> block never gets executed.

/usr/bin/xcrun -sdk iphoneos PackageApplication \
-o "${IPA_DIR}/${PROJECT}.ipa" \
-verbose "${APP}" \
-sign "${SIGNING_IDENTITY}" \
--embed "${PROVISIONING_PROFILE}"
 It's a bit tricky to look at the logs where the error occurs, but here it is: ### Codesigning '/Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home/jobs/myapp/workspace/myapp_adhoc_7.mobileprovision' with 'iPhone Distribution: mycompany Inc.'

 I'll try to fix this myself and later add the solution here, but in case anyone is faster than me please go ahead. I have not specified --resource-rules in any settings. I guess xcrun uses this setting on its own, even though it is deprecated.

@CONTENT:I want to use the svm classifier for facial expression detection. I know opencv has a svm api, but I have no clue what should be the input to train the classifier. I have read many papers till now, all of them says after facial feature detection train the classifier. so far what I did, Face detection, 16 facial points calculation in every frame. below is an output of facial feature detection![enter image description A vector which holds the features points pixel address Note: I know how I can train the SVM only with positive and negative images, I saw this codehere, But I don't know how I combine the facial feature information with it. Can anybody please help me to start the classification with svm. a. what should be the sample input to train the classifier? b. How do I train the classifier with this facial feature points? Regards,

@TITLE:Return XML from boto calls
@CONTENT:I am using boto 2.32.1 with Python 2.7.6. I am having problems with the list_orders function of boto's mws modules to get the XML data of my Amazon orders. Here is the call I make: response = connection.list_orders(CreatedAfter='2014-08-26T05:53:44+00:00', 
   MarketplaceId=['XXXXXXXXXXXXX'])
 Here is the value of response (with personal information removed obviously) ListOrdersResponse{u'xmlns': u'https://mws.amazonservices.com/Orders/2013-09-01'}
(ListOrdersResult: ListOrdersResult{}
(CreatedBefore: u'2014-08-26T10:06:10Z', Orders: ^Orders^{}
(Order: [Order{}(***ORDER INFORMATION***)])), 
ResponseMetadata: ^ResponseMetadata^{}(RequestId: u'xxxxxxxxxx'))
 This isn't ideal because I have another module for eBay sales that works with the XML returned by ebaysdk-python. Amazon formats their XML similarly to eBay so if I could get the XML returned by Amazon instead of the format above, it would be brilliant. I have noticed that if I use boto.set_stream_logger('boto'), it will print the XML returned so maybe I could take advantage of that somehow? This is what I would like to be returned: <ListOrdersResponse xmlns="https://mws.amazonservices.com/Orders/2013-09-01">
  <ListOrdersResult>
    <Orders>
      <Order>
        ***ORDER INFORMATION***
      </Order>
    </Orders>
    <CreatedBefore>2014-08-26T10:18:59Z</CreatedBefore>
  </ListOrdersResult>
  <ResponseMetadata>
    <RequestId>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</RequestId>
  </ResponseMetadata>
</ListOrdersResponse>
 I could then use Python's brilliant xml.etree.ElementTree to parse and work with the data. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if I done something wrong, it's my first time posting.

@LINK:/questions/25211553/datatables-custom-response-handling
@TITLE:DataTables: Custom Response Handling
@CONTENT:I started working on AngularJS and DataTables and wonder whether it is possible to customize the response DataTables is expecting. The current expectation of the DataTables plugin is something like this: {
    "draw": 1,
    "recordsTotal": 57,
    "recordsFiltered": 5,
    "data": [...]
}
 On the server end, the API's are being handled by django-tastypie The response from server is: {
     meta: {
        limit: 20,
        next: null,
        offset: 0,
        previous: null,
        total_count: 2
     },

     objects: [...]
 }
 So, is there a way to tweak Datatables Plugin to accept/map this response, or I'll have to find a way to add expected fields to the api? So far I've done this:     var deptTable = angular.element('#deptManagementTable').DataTable({
        processing: true,
        serverSide: true,
        pagingType: "simple_numbers",
        ajax: {
            url: "/client/api/v1/departments/",
            data: function(d) {
                d.limit = d.length;
                d.offset = d.start;
                d.dept_name__icontains = d.search.value;
            },
            dataSrc: function(json) {
                for (var i=0, len=json.objects.length ; i<len ; i++) {
                    json.objects[i].DT_RowId = json.objects[i].dept_id;
                }
                return json.objects;
            }
        },
        aLengthMenu: [
            [5, 25, 50, 100],
            [5, 25, 50, 100]
        ],
        iDisplayLength: 5,
        columns: [
            {
                data: "dept_name"
            },
            {

@TITLE:how to fetch all of data from hbase table in spark
@CONTENT:I have a big table in hbase that name is UserAction, and it has three column families(song,album,singer). I need to fetch all of data from 'song' column family as a JavaRDD object. I try this code, but it's not efficient. Is there a better solution to do this ?     static SparkConf sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName("test").setMaster(
        "local[4]");
static JavaSparkContext jsc = new JavaSparkContext(sparkConf);

static void getRatings() {

    Configuration conf = HBaseConfiguration.create();
    conf.set(TableInputFormat.INPUT_TABLE, "UserAction");
    conf.set(TableInputFormat.SCAN_COLUMN_FAMILY, "song");

    JavaPairRDD<ImmutableBytesWritable, Result> hBaseRDD = jsc
            .newAPIHadoopRDD(
                    conf,
                    TableInputFormat.class,
                    org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.ImmutableBytesWritable.class,
                    org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Result.class);

    JavaRDD<Rating> count = hBaseRDD
            .map(new Function<Tuple2<ImmutableBytesWritable, Result>, JavaRDD<Rating>>() {

                @Override
                public JavaRDD<Rating> call(
                        Tuple2<ImmutableBytesWritable, Result> t)
                        throws Exception {
                    Result r = t._2;
                    int user = Integer.parseInt(Bytes.toString(r.getRow()));
                    ArrayList<Rating> ra = new ArrayList<>();

                    for (Cell c : r.rawCells()) {

                        int product = Integer.parseInt(Bytes
                                .toString(CellUtil.cloneQualifier(c)));
                        double rating = Double.parseDouble(Bytes
                                .toString(CellUtil.cloneValue(c)));

                        ra.add(new Rating(user, product, rating));
                    }

                    return jsc.parallelize(ra);
                }
            })
            .reduce(new Function2<JavaRDD<Rating>, JavaRDD<Rating>, JavaRDD<Rating>>() {

}
 Song column family scheme design is : RowKey = userID, columnQualifier = songID and value = rating.

@LINK:/questions/24324285/adding-items-to-and-querying-the-ios-keychain-with-swift
@TITLE:Adding Items to and Querying the iOS Keychain with Swift
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble converting all of the Objective C code samples that are available for adding data and querying data from the iOS Keychain into Swift. I'm trying to do a basic storage of a string (an access token) and reading it back. I've had a look at some of the other questions on Stack Overflow, but I can't quite get it to work. I've tried to piece together a solution from the various sources. Edit 1: I tried with a more basic setup, because I thought my self.defaultKeychainQuery might have been messing things up. I've updated the code below to the latest version. Edit 2: Got it working. I wasn't adding the data value to the save query properly. I needed to convert the string to NSData. I've updated the code below to the most recent working version. Edit 3: As Xerxes points out below, this code doesn't work with Xcode versions higher than Beta 1 because of some issue with Dictionaries. If you know of a fix for this, please let me know. Update: I turned this into a keychain library written in Swift called Locksmith. Save class func save(service: NSString, data: NSString) {
  var dataFromString: NSData = data.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding, allowLossyConversion: false)
  // Instantiate a new default keychain query
  var keychainQuery: NSMutableDictionary = NSMutableDictionary(objects: [kSecClassGenericPassword, service, userAccount, dataFromString], forKeys: [kSecClass, kSecAttrService, kSecAttrAccount, kSecValueData])

  // Delete any existing items
  SecItemDelete(keychainQuery as CFDictionaryRef)

  // Add the new keychain item
  var status: OSStatus = SecItemAdd(keychainQuery as CFDictionaryRef, nil)

  // Check that it worked ok
  println("Saving status code is: \(status)")
}
 Load   class func load(service: NSString) -> AnyObject? {
    // Instantiate a new default keychain query
    // Tell the query to return a result
    // Limit our results to one item
    var keychainQuery: NSMutableDictionary = NSMutableDictionary(objects: [kSecClassGenericPassword, service, userAccount, kCFBooleanTrue, kSecMatchLimitOne], forKeys: [kSecClass, kSecAttrService, kSecAttrAccount, kSecReturnData, kSecMatchLimit])



    // I'm not too sure what's happening here...
    var dataTypeRef :Unmanaged<AnyObject>?

    // Search for the keychain items
    let status: OSStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(keychainQuery, &dataTypeRef)


    println("Loading status code is: \(status)")

    // I'm not too sure what's happening here...
    let opaque = dataTypeRef?.toOpaque()

    if let op = opaque? {
      let retrievedData = Unmanaged<NSData>.fromOpaque(op).takeUnretainedValue()
      println("Retrieved the following data from the keychain: \(retrievedData)")
      var str = NSString(data: retrievedData, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
      println("The decoded string is \(str)")
    } else {
      println("Nothing was retrieved from the keychain.")
    }

    return nil
  }
 Usage (view controller) KeychainService.saveToken("sometoken")
KeychainService.loadToken()
 which uses these convenience methods class func saveToken(token: NSString) {
    self.save("service", data: token)
  }

class func loadToken() {
    var token = self.load("service")
    if let t = token {
      println("The token is: \(t)")
    }
  }
 This leads to the output in the console: Saving status code is: 0
Loading status code is: 0
Retrieved the following data from the keychain: <736f6d65 746f6b65 6e>
The decoded string is sometoken
 Thanks a lot for your help. I'm not too sure what to do with dataTypeRef once I've got it, or if it has any data given the code above.
@CODE:class func save(service: NSString, data: NSString) {
  var dataFromString: NSData = data.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding, allowLossyConversion: false)

  // Delete any existing items
  SecItemDelete(keychainQuery as CFDictionaryRef)

  // Add the new keychain item
  var status: OSStatus = SecItemAdd(keychainQuery as CFDictionaryRef, nil)

  // Check that it worked ok
  println("Saving status code is: \(status)")
} class func load(service: NSString) -> AnyObject? {
    // Instantiate a new default keychain query
    // Tell the query to return a result
    // Limit our results to one item

@TITLE:Swift reverse engineering:swift function name rule?

@TITLE:How to construct a ScrollView using Swift?
@CONTENT:I'm constructing my first App for IOS and I'm struggling to find a way to do a simple ScrollView using the Swift code on the XCode6, please can someone help me to find the solution? My problem is that I don't know how to make the scrollview work in my code. I already putted the code as you can see below in the ViewController.swift and I was expecting to be able to select the Outlet "scroller" in the Main.storyboard for a ViewController, instead of this I'm receiving the error *"fatal error: Can't unwrap Optional.None (lldb)"* EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_1386_INVOP, subcode=0x0) I have some ViewController screens and in one of that I putted one ScrollView and I want to make it works using the Swift. I'm stuck on this: import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet var scroller:UIScrollView

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        scroller.scrollEnabled = true;
        scroller.contentSize = CGSizeMake(320, 624);
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }
}
 I think if someone can provide a simple example how to do a scrollview using swift it will solve my problem. Any help is appreciate. Trying to do it in a old style I tried to do it using a .m and .h file: ViewController.m #import "Amigo-Bridging-Header.h"

@interface ViewController ()

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [scroller setScrollEnabled:YES];
    [scroller setContentSize:CGSizeMake(320, 624)];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
}

- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning
{
    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
    // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}

@end
 Amigo-Bridging-Header.h #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface ViewController : UIViewController {
    IBOutlet UIScrollView *scroller;
}
@end

@TITLE:Encoding from FFMPEG to MPEG-DASH, WebM with Keyframe Clusters to work with MediaSource API
@CONTENT:I'm currently sending a video stream to Chrome, to play via the MediaSource API. As I understand it, MediaSource only supports MP4 files encoded with MPEG-DASH, or WebM files that have clusters beginning with keyframes (otherwise it raises the error: Media segment did not begin with keyframe). Is there any way to encode in MPEG-DASH or keyframed WebM formats with FFMPEG in real-time? EDIT: I just tried it with ffmpeg ... -f webm -vcodec vp8 -g 1 ... so that every frame is a keyframe. Not the ideal solution. It does work with MediaStream now though. Any way to sync up the segments with the keyframes in WebM so not every frame needs to be a keyframe?

@LINK:/questions/24030855/performance-issues-with-app-engine-memcache-ndb-get-multi
@TITLE:Performance issues with App Engine memcache / ndb.get_multi
@CONTENT:I'm seeing very poor performance when fetching multiple keys from Memcache using ndb.get_multi() in App Engine (Python). I am fetching ~500 small objects, all of which are in memcache. If I do this using ndb.get_multi(keys), it takes 1500ms or more. Here is typical output from App Stats: and As you can see, all the data is served from memcache. Most of the time is reported as being outside of RPC calls. However, my code is about as minimal as you can get, so if the time is spent on CPU it must be somewhere inside ndb: # Get set of keys for items. This runs very quickly.
item_keys = memcache.get(items_memcache_key)
# Get ~500 small items from memcache. This is very slow (~1500ms).
items = ndb.get_multi(item_keys)
 The first memcache.get you see in App Stats is the single fetch to get a set of keys. The second memcache.get is the ndb.get_multi call. The items I am fetching are super-simple: class Item(ndb.Model):
    name = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)
    image_url = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)
    image_width = ndb.IntegerProperty(indexed=False)
    image_height = ndb.IntegerProperty(indexed=False)
 Is this some kind of known ndb performance issue? Something to do with deserialization cost? Or is it a memcache issue? I found that if instead of fetching 500 objects, I instead aggregate all the data into a single blob, my function runs in 20ms instead of >1500ms: # Get set of keys for items. This runs very quickly.
item_keys = memcache.get(items_memcache_key)
# Get individual item data.
# If we get all the data from memcache as a single blob it is very fast (~20ms).
item_data = memcache.get(items_data_key)
if not item_data:
    items = ndb.get_multi(item_keys)
    flat_data = json.dumps([{'name': item.name} for item in items])
    memcache.add(items_data_key, flat_data)
 This is interesting, but isn't really a solution for me since the set of items I need to fetch isn't static. Is the performance I'm seeing typical/expected? All these measurements are on the default App Engine production config (F1 instance, shared memcache). Is it deserialization cost? Or due to fetching multiple keys from memcache maybe? I don't think the issue is instance ramp-up time. I profiled the code line by line using time.clock() calls and I see roughly similar numbers (3x faster than what I see in AppStats, but still very slow). Here's a typical profile: # Fetch keys: 20 ms
# ndb.get_multi: 500 ms
# Number of keys is 521, fetch time per key is 0.96 ms
 Update: Out of interest I also profiled this with all the app engine performance settings increased to maximum (F4 instance, 2400Mhz, dedicated memcache). The performance wasn't much better. On the faster instance the App Stats timings now match my time.clock() profile (so 500ms to fetch 500 small objects instead of 1500ms). However, it seem seems extremely slow.
@CODE:ndb.get_multi() ndb.get_multi(keys) # Get set of keys for items. This runs very quickly.
item_keys = memcache.get(items_memcache_key)
# Get ~500 small items from memcache. This is very slow (~1500ms).
items = ndb.get_multi(item_keys) ndb.get_multi class Item(ndb.Model):
    name = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)
    image_url = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)
    image_width = ndb.IntegerProperty(indexed=False)
    image_height = ndb.IntegerProperty(indexed=False) # Get set of keys for items. This runs very quickly.
item_keys = memcache.get(items_memcache_key)
# Get individual item data.

@TITLE:How can I view the shared preferences file using Android Studio?
@CONTENT:I'm using shared preferences to store certain values for my app. I would like to see the file where the info is actually stored on my phone. I found many ways to do this on Eclipse, but I'm debugging on Android Studio. My phone is rooted. I read that having root access is important to read these types of files. If there is no way, then I will look up how to access the info through my program then output it to log cat. Hopefully, though, I can just view the file on the phone directly as it is much simpler. Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/23604828/how-can-i-stream-a-response-from-wcf-without-buffering
@TITLE:How can I stream a response from WCF without buffering?
@CONTENT:I have a restful (webHttpBinding) self-hosted WCF service. Most methods are returning xml or json version of objects to the client. I have a couple of GET methods that trigger long running methods and I'd like to stream the log reponse to the browser (or application) so that the user knows what's going on. This would be simple to accomplish with HttpContext.Current.Response.OutputStream.Write. Unfortunately, HttpContext.Current is always null in a self-hosted WCF service, even if I include the aspNetCompatibilityEnabled config (IIS is not an option unfortunately). I have tried AnonymousPipeServerStream: WCF and streaming requests and responses along with first setting: OutgoingWebResponseContext context = WebOperationContext.Current.OutgoingResponse;
context.ContentType = "text/plain";
 so that the response comes into the browser it doesn't download the stream into a file to save. In Chrome it doesn't work at all - it buffers until the end. In IE or wget it appears to buffer for around 4k (or something) at a time. This is no good for logging as unless I spit out loads of unnecessary log messages to force output, the user doesn't really know what's going on. I can only assume that this is because the response is actually a chunked response and the chunks are 4k (rather than just writing to the outputstream). The fix to get chrome to output is apparently to write some garbage to the content before sending the chunked response: Chunked transfer encoding - browser behavior, however, I don't think this is possible with WCF. So, possible solutions I'm looking for: A way to write to the outputstream in WCF in a self hosted service (without IIS). or A way to control the chunk sizes in a stream response (& a way to write some content first so that Chrome will render the chunks). Another option, I suppose, is to ditch WCF in favour of something more REST friendly (I'm beginning to think WCF wasn't the right choice). However, having written so much in WCF now, this seems like a tedious task. Unless there is something I can switch to that would be an easy migration (e.g. if I could reuse the same service classes, perhaps with just different attributes). Nancy maybe?

 Now, I want to read all these files, and "collect" Sen's Statistics from each file (eg. .24) and compile into one file along with the corresponding file names. I have to do it in R. I have worked with CSV files but not sure how to use text files. This is the code I am using now: require(gtools)
GG <- grep("*.txt", list.files(), value = TRUE)
GG<-mixedsort(GG)
S <- sapply(seq(GG), function(i){
X <- readLines(GG[i])

write.table(SenStat, "sen.csv",sep = ", ",row.names = FALSE)

 Also I am not getting the file names the other column of Output. Please help! Diagnosis 1 The code is reading the = sign as well. This is the output of print(spl)  [1] ""       "5.55"   ""       "-.18"   ""       "3.08"   ""       "3.05"   ""       "1.19"   ""       "-.32"

 Diagnosis 2 Found the problem I think. The negative sign is a bit tricky. In some files it is SEN SLOPE =-1.07
SEN SLOPE = -.11
 Because of the gap after =, I am getting NAs for the first one, but the code is reading the second one. How can I modify the regex to fix this? Thanks!

@TITLE:git smudge/clean filter between branches
@CONTENT:There are many related questions involving smudge/clean filters - I have spent some hours reading them, and trying various options, but still failing. I hope I can ask in a way that I get an answer that works for me. Specifically, I have read the page most of these answers link back to: Customizing Git - Git Attributes tl;dr Its a detailed question, but the summary is: Can I store DEBUG = false in a file on one branch, and DEBUG = true in another branch, using smudge/clean filters to manage that file? And how? Background I have various remote repos hosted at bitbucket. I am using SourceTree on Win8, to clone the remote repos to my laptop. I create different branches for development, features, releases etc (following A successful Git branching model for better or worse). I have an Android java class called Dbug.java that contains a boolean which turns on/off various debug logging, mocking etc features in my code. public static final boolean DEBUG = false;
 I would like this value to be false on my "production" (master) branch, and to be true on my feature branches. Is this possible using filters, or have I already misunderstood the use case? I am unsure if filters work like this between 2 branches of the same locally hosted repo, or if the filters only work between 2 repos. Creating the filters Working locally, I checked out the production branch. I created a test file called debug_flag.txt with the following contents: // false on production branch
// true on other branches
DEBUG = false;
 I created a file in the root of my local repo called .gitattributes and added the filter reference to it: debug_flag.txt filter=debug_on_off
 I updated the .git/config file with the filter definition: [filter "debug_on_off"]
    clean = sed -e 's/DEBUG = true/DEBUG = false/'
    smudge = sed -s 's/DEBUG = false/DEBUG = true/'
 In my understanding, this should ensure that my file always has a false value in production, but will have a true value when I branch from production. Is this a correct understanding? Testing the filters I created a new branch test using: git checkout -b test
 I checked the contents of my file: $ cat debug_flag.txt

// false on production branch
// true on other branches
DEBUG = false;
 I expected to see the value true in the file Shouldn't the "smudge" filter have run when I checked out the file? I added a new line to the file, and committed. I then switched back to the production branch, and this is where things get weird. If I look at the file in SourceTree, there are no changes on this branch since it was created. That is what I would expect, since the only change was made on a different branch. If I look at the file in the terminal, or Notepad++, I see my value has changed: $ cat debug_flag.txt

// false on production branch
// true on other branches
DEBUG = true;
 I have not yet merged the change across from the test branch, I have not made a commit on the production branch, yet the file has changed. it looks like the smudge filter was run on the file within this branch, but not across branches. I'm missing a vital piece of the puzzle, and hopefully it is something simple that can be spotted by someone with experience doing this. My bet is this is a simple misunderstanding of the concept. Pls prompt for any missing info... Update based on VonC's reply Setting up the basic filters worked quite well. Defined the filter in the config file as: [filter "debug_on_off"]
    clean = sed -e 's/DEBUG = true/DEBUG = false/'
    smudge = sed -s 's/DEBUG = false/DEBUG = true/'
 Creating a new branch fixes false -> true, merging back changes true -> false. Confining the change to just the production (master) branch required custom scripts that were aware of the branch they are being run from. So the config file became: [filter "debug_on_off"]
    clean = ./scripts/master_clean.sh
    smudge = ./scripts/master_smudge.sh
 master_clean.sh: #!/bin/sh
branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if [ "master" = "$branch" ]; then
    sed -e s/DEBUG = true/DEBUG = false/ $1

branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if [ "master" = "$branch" ]; then
    sed -e s/DEBUG = false/DEBUG = true/ $1
else
    cat $1
fi
 At this point, I am running into inconsistencies between what SourceTree is seeing, and what is being shown in Notepad++ for the contents of the debug file. SourceTree is showing the changes, but Notepad++ is not. I am accepting VonC's answer, since it answers the basic question I posed. However, I will likely be implementing the solution I wrote, since it solves the underlying problem that I am trying to solve, in an easier way (for me): retaining a different config file on separate branches.

@TITLE:Ratchet + nginx + SSL/secure websocket
@CONTENT:I've been trying to run Ratchet.io over SSL (this problem: php ratchet websocket SSL connect?). My webserver is running at myhost.mobi, and I have created a separate virtual host for websocket service "wws.myhost.mobi". My web socket: $webSock = new React\Socket\Server($loop);
$webSock->listen(8080, '0.0.0.0');
$webServer = new Ratchet\Server\IoServer(
    new Ratchet\Http\HttpServer(
        new Ratchet\WebSocket\WsServer(
            new Ratchet\Wamp\WampServer(
                $pusher
            )
        )
    ),
    $webSock
);
 My nginx config (I'm on nginx 1.5.8): upstream websocketserver {
        server localhost:8080;
}

server {
    server_name wss.myapp.mobi;

    listen 443;

 So, when I load the page in Firefox, I see an outgoing connection to wss://wss.myapp.mobi:8080/, which is hanging (the spinner) and never completes or dies. I do not see any trace of request arriving on the backend in the logs. What am I missing there? Thanks! EDIT I have realized that I should be connecting to wss://wss.myapp.mobi, but now I am getting "101 Switching Protocols" status. EDIT 2 Everything is working now with the config above. "101 Switching Protocols" status turns out to be a normal message. PROBLEM SOLVED!

@TITLE:How to determine if a GPS coordinate lies within a rectangular area?
@CONTENT:I went through many similar questions on Stackoverflow and other websites and I based my solution on those answers but I still can't get it to work¡K My problem: I want to determine whether or not a certain GPS location P lies within a rectangular area bounded by four given GPS coordinates A, B, C, D. At the moment I am calculating the areas of triangles ABP, BCP, CDP and DAP. If any of those areas is bigger than zero (don't be upset, mathematicians) the point lies outside my rectangle as explained here. Code: private static double triangleArea(Location a, Location b, Location c) {
    // (C.x*B.y-B.x*C.y)-(C.x*A.y-A.x*C.y)+(B.x*A.y-A.x*B.y)
    double result = (c.getLongitude()*b.getLatitude()-b.getLongitude()*c.getLatitude())-(c.getLongitude()*a.getLatitude()-a.getLongitude()*c.getLatitude())+(b.getLongitude()*a.getLatitude()-a.getLongitude()*b.getLatitude());
    return result;
}

public static boolean isInsideSquare(Location a, Location b, Location c, Location d, Location p) {
    if (triangleArea(a,b,p)>0 || triangleArea(b,c,p)>0 || triangleArea(c,d,p)>0 || triangleArea(d,a,p)>0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
 But when I call this function it's always returning false. Even when using the following coordinates (latitude, longitude): A: (50.884706, 4.714151)
B: (50.884944, 4.716149)
C: (50.884679, 4.716228)
D: (50.884441, 4.714230)
P: (50.884538, 4.714615)
 Yet when I plot those points on a map (e.g. here) I can see that point P lies within ABCD¡K (see below) I've read some easy solutions where you just subtract the x, y coordinates of your points, but that would obviously only work for rectangles parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, whereas my rectangle can be oriented in any angle. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong or suggest a better solution to solve this problem? Thanks a lot!
@CODE:P A B C D ABP BCP CDP DAP private static double triangleArea(Location a, Location b, Location c) {
    // (C.x*B.y-B.x*C.y)-(C.x*A.y-A.x*C.y)+(B.x*A.y-A.x*B.y)

    return result;

@TITLE:How to use Bolts Framework[Facebook+Parse]
@CONTENT:Just Now I see this announcement from Facebook about Bolts Framework for IOS. I can see this as main concept "The first component in Bolts is ¡§tasks¡¨, which make organization of complex asynchronous code more manageable" But I didn't get this. I get confused about Bolt framework that How could use it(whether it related to webservice or use to parsing JSON response). They didn't provide any example with xcode projects. Only provide example with ParseObject with parse SDK But I don't about parse SDK. Facebook provide explanation about this. But I can't find out how to integrate with my project. Code they provided is very confusing. [[object saveAsync:obj] continueWithBlock:^id(BFTask *task) {
  if (task.isCancelled) {
    // the save was cancelled.
  } else if (task.error) {
    // the save failed.
  } else {
    // the object was saved successfully.
    SaveResult *saveResult = task.result;
  }
  return nil;
}];
 We can download bolts-framework here. Anyone could explain more about this? I'm very eager to know about this new tech... Update: Here I received some answer about new question of bolts. Examples: Assume you want to load all images from AssertLibrary and resize all images to standard size while loading, so it will struck if do with main thread. In this place, If you go with async operation means, How to use BFTask with it? Another Ex. In one time, you are trying to call 10 webservice parallel with async operation, how could you use GCD with BFTask?

@LINK:/questions/21256479/setting-requirejs-i18n-locale-dynamically
@TITLE:Setting RequireJS i18n locale dynamically
@CONTENT:I am using the RequireJS i18n plugin to load translations into my application. I'm struggling with the concept of runtime determination of a user's preferred language. The plugin works well if you're using navigator.language to determine the user's preferred language, but in my app, the user's language is held in a database on the server. So I need to set the locale at runtime: require.config({
    config: {
        i18n: {
            locale: userLocale
        }
    }
});
 So what I need is a clever way of setting userLocale before RequireJS has loaded my application. Does anyone know what would be the best way to achieve this? Possibilities include: 1) Setting userLocale outside of my application, in a non-AMD way: //run Ajax call to determine user's localization preferencess
var Localization = Localization || getUserLocalization(); 

//and then...
require.config({
    config: {
        i18n: {
            locale: Localization.userLocale
        }
    }
});

require(['app']);
 This makes me a little bit sad as it means some of my application will be outside of RequireJS, and thus untidy. It also means all the user's localization settings (language timezone, date format, numeric format) will be held in the global namespace. 2) Having a separate require call to retrieve localization settings I'm not sure how this work, but perhaps: var Localization = require(['localization']);

require.config({
    config: {
        i18n: {
            locale: Localization.userLocale
        }
    }
});

require(['app']);
 Perhaps this wouldn't work due to asynchronousness? Also the app would not have access to the Localization object, so it would still need to be stored as a global variable. Can anyone see a good solution to this problem? Has anyone used the RequireJS i18n plugin to do something similar?
@CODE:navigator.language require.config({
    config: {
        i18n: {
            locale: userLocale
        }
    }
}); userLocale userLocale //run Ajax call to determine user's localization preferencess
var Localization = Localization || getUserLocalization(); 

//and then...
require.config({
    config: {
        i18n: {
            locale: Localization.userLocale
        }
    }
});

require(['app']); var Localization = require(['localization']);

require.config({
    config: {
        i18n: {
            locale: Localization.userLocale
        }
    }
});

@CONTENT:I have a problem with passing Map parameters or object to Retrofit POST request. I follow square, kdubb labs tutorials and this thread and I couldn't figure it out. My current code which works: public interface FacebookUser {

    );
}
 and code: RestAdapter restAdapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()
                        .setServer(requestMaker.getUrl())
                        .build();

FacebookUser facebookUser = restAdapter.create(FacebookUser.class);
facebookUser.login(getFbAccessToken(),
getString(R.string.config_os),
Info.getAndroidId(getBaseContext()),

        Info.getAppVersionName(getBaseContext()),
        "" + 1,
        new Callback<FacebookLoginUserResponse>() {

    public void success(FacebookLoginUserResponse facebookLoginUserResponse, Response response) {
    }

    @Override
    public void failure(RetrofitError retrofitError) {
    }
});

    @POST("/user/login-facebook")
    void login(
            @Body Map<String, String> map,

    );
}

    map.put("fb_access_token", getFbAccessToken());
    map.put("os", "android");
    map.put("device", Info.getAndroidId(getBaseContext()));
    map.put("os_version", Build.VERSION.RELEASE);
    map.put("app_version", Info.getAppVersionName(getBaseContext()));
    map.put("online", "" + 1);
 Questions: What is it wrong? How can I pass object to request?

@TITLE:What is LINQ Actually Compiled To?
@CONTENT:Background The background for this is that I had a recent conversation in the comments with another clearly knowledgeable user about how LINQ is compiled. I first "summarized" and said LINQ was compiled to a for loop. While this isn't correct, my understanding from other stacks such as this one is that the LINQ query is compiled to a lambda with a loop inside of it. This is then called when the variable is enumerated for the first time (after which the results are stored). The other user said that LINQ takes additional optimizations such as hashing. I couldn't find any supporting documentation either for or against this. I know this seems like a really obscure point but I have always felt that if I don't understand how something works completely, its going to be difficult to understand why I'm not using it correctly. The Question So, lets take the following very simple example: var productNames = 
    from p in products 
    where p.Id > 100 and p.Id < 5000
    select p.ProductName;
 What is this statement actually compiled to in CLR? What optimizations does LINQ take over me just writing a function that manually parses the results? Is this just semantics or is there more to it than that? Clarification Clearly I'm asking this question because I don't understand what the inside of the LINQ "black box" looks like. Even though I understand that LINQ is complicated (and powerful), I'm mostly looking for a basic understanding of either the CLR or a functional equivalent to a LINQ statement. There are great sites out there for helping understand how to create a LINQ statement but very few of these seem to give any guidance on how those are actually compiled or run. Side Note - I will absolutely read through the John Skeet series on linq to objects. Side Note 2 - I shouldn't have tagged this as LINQ to SQL. I understand how ORM's and micro-ORM's work. That is really besides the point of the question.

@LINK:/questions/20546750/qtcpsocket-reading-and-writing
@TITLE:QTcpSocket: reading and writing
@CONTENT:I know some similar questions may have been asked already, but the answers to those I found covered very specific problems and I still haven't figured it out. In my program I'm creating a QObject (called QPeer) that uses a QTcpSocket to communicate with another such object over a network. QPeer has a slot that accepts a QByteArray with data (sendData(QByteArray)). The entire contents of that array are considered to be one 'message' and they are written to the socket. I want to do the following: every time a message is written, I want the receiving QPeer to emit its signal dataReceived(QByteArray) exactly once, that QByteArray containing the entire message. (NOTE: all signals/slots, both private ones connecting the QPeer with its socket and the public ones such as sendData(QByteArray) are serialized by using Qt::QueuedConnection whenever necessary.) I use the signal QTcpSocket::readyRead() for asynchronous reading from the socket. Now I know I can't just call QTcpSocket::write() once in sendData and then assume that for every write I do, the QTcpSocket on the other side produces exactly one readyRead signal. So what should I do? This is my idea, please tell me if this will work: WRITING: void QPeer::sendData(QByteArray data)
{
    // TODO: write data.size() as raw int of exactly 4 bytes to socket
    const char *bytes = data.constData();
    int bytesWritten = 0;
    while (bytesWritten < data.size())
        bytesWritten += _socket->write(bytes + bytesWritten);
}
 READING: now I want the read function (connected to QTcpSocket::readyRead()) to use the header (the 4 byte int specifying the length of the message) and then read that amount of bytes; next emit dataReceived with exactly those bytes. I'm having serious trouble trying to do this. For example: what to do if readyRead is emitted and I can read the header of a message, but not the amount of bytes specified? Or what if a header has only been received partially? 1. How do I correctly write the header (4 byte int) to the socket? 2. How do I correctly implement the read function so that it does what I want? Any tips are welcome. Thanks!
@CODE:sendData(QByteArray) dataReceived(QByteArray) sendData(QByteArray) Qt::QueuedConnection QTcpSocket::readyRead() QTcpSocket::write() void QPeer::sendData(QByteArray data)
{
    // TODO: write data.size() as raw int of exactly 4 bytes to socket
    const char *bytes = data.constData();
    int bytesWritten = 0;
    while (bytesWritten < data.size())
        bytesWritten += _socket->write(bytes + bytesWritten);
} QTcpSocket::readyRead()

@TITLE:Transparent UITableViewCell flashing background when animating
@CONTENT:I have a UIViewController with a custom background color. On top of it there's a UITableView with UITableViewCells that are semi-transparent (white color with opacity 0.5). The issue I'm blaming about and the one I'm banging my head against the wall is in iOS 7, when you have a UITableViewCell with semi-transparent background and you try to delete/insert/moving rows (so relying on an animation effect) the entire UITableView with its cells flashing for just 0.1 second and set cells background to a more transparent one. This is very annoying. The only thing I'm doing is set the background color of self.view with: self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.4 green:0.5 blue:0.7 alpha:1];
 and set the background color of cells with: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithWhite:1 alpha:0.5];
}
 Here's a gif showing you the problem: And here's the super simple project: https://github.com/socksz/TransparentCellFlashing Please help me to solve this ridicolous issue! :P

 That was simple enough, but it doesn't work on touch events. I know there are some mobile native things that can solve this, but this is purely for browsers--both mobile and non-mobile. The project: Here's my basic project, Croppy. I've got some rudimentary touch zoom and good dragging, but it's hampered by my crop div being on top of the canvas (this is visually necessary, unfortunately). There is an example included, if you wish to tinker with it directly. I'm trying to do it all without any external libraries as an exercise. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

I already know that one should always use absolute paths when moving to from a directory to another. But, there must be plenty others (for example, what to do when a command fail, what is a nice way to stop the script and inform the user about it). So, does anyone have a list of such a rules and hints specifically targeted for shell scripts?

Is the only way to daisy chain from the controller: mainview.getSubView().getSubView().getSubView().setActionListener(new AL()); and: mainview.getSubView().getSubView().getSubView().getSomeTextFieldText(); This seems extremely impractical [and I can't see the benefits of this method] Any tips or guidance would be helpful. No tutorial I see explains MVC with children views. On a side note- I know I should have the views and models use observable/observer - but even with those I have a problem with setting action listeners.

@TITLE:Hibernate Spatial - Query within an X kilometer radius?
@CONTENT:I am new to Hibernate Spatial, and am trying to perform a simple query of objects within a given radius. I've created a number of entries in my database with properties corresponding to a latitude and longitude, using data from Google Maps and other sources. This property is defined like this in my Entity class: @Column
@Type(type = "org.hibernate.spatial.GeometryType")
private Point coordinates = null;
 I'm now trying to figure out how to do a search of all entity objects that have coordinates that fall within a radius of x kilometers from a given point. For example, I'd like to find objects that fall within a 50 kilometer radius of the point (12.34567, -76.54321). However, I can't find any examples or tutorials that would explain how to do this in Hibernate Spatial. Can anyone give me any information on how a query like this can be constructed?

@LINK:/questions/20008324/gradle-multiple-jars-from-single-source-folder
@TITLE:Gradle multiple jars from single source folder
@CONTENT:As for now we have a project structure with single source folder named src, which contains source code for three modules. What I want to do is: 1) Compile source code. This is easily done with sourceSets definition: sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDir 'src'
        }
    }
}
 2) Put compilation results into three jars. I am doing this via three 'jar' type tasks: I am doing this now via three separate tasks: util.jar task utilJar(type: Jar) {
    from(sourceSets.main.output) {
        include "my/util/package/**"
    }
}
 client.jar task clientJar(type: Jar) {
    from(sourceSets.main.output) {
        include "my/client/package/**"
    }
}
 server.jar task serverJar(type: Jar) {
    from(sourceSets.main.output) {
        include "**"
    }
    excludes.addAll(utilJar.includes)
    excludes.addAll(clientJar.includes)
}
 The thing is that server.jar should contain all classes that are not contained within client.jar and util.jar. In ant build script we solve this problem by using difference ant task. How this can be done in gradle (my current approach doesn't work)? Maybe my approach is completely wrong. Please advice. P.S. as for now we CAN NOT change the project source code folder structure.
@CODE:src sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDir 'src'
        }
    }
} task utilJar(type: Jar) {
    from(sourceSets.main.output) {
        include "my/util/package/**"
    }
} task clientJar(type: Jar) {
    from(sourceSets.main.output) {
        include "my/client/package/**"
    }
} task serverJar(type: Jar) {
    from(sourceSets.main.output) {
        include "**"
    }
    excludes.addAll(utilJar.includes)

@CONTENT:Edit: The site is on Windows Server 2003, hence cannot be upgraded to .NET framework 4.5. Our web site is serving ASP.NET ON .NET 4. When using IE 11 the auto postback stopped working with the error "_doPostBack is undefined". It's very likely can be fixed with some modification to the browser definition file, which I don't know how yet. Microsoft suggests feature detection (preferred), or changing the browser definition file. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/IE/hh869299%28v=vs.85%29.aspx It looks like feature detection means dropping auto postback all together. Isn't that just like rewriting the whole site? Can someone describe how to accomplish both feature detection and browser definition file modification? Which way is preferred and why. The accepted answer solved the problem, seems like it's the only way if you are stuck on server 2003. It would be really really nice if someone could explain how feature detection could be done without massive code changes.

@TITLE:Using android gradle + dagger to run instrumentTests
@CONTENT:I have began using Android Studio and gradle recently for android development and find it much better overall than eclipse/ant or maven. However I've recently began trying to implement some kind of unit and or integration tests with my app. I was able to get basic tests working using the Espresso framework recently released by google. I had some tests though where I needed to mock and inject mocked versions of objects. I used dagger in the past for another project so I included dagger into my project. However now my tests won't run because of the following error: gradle connectedCheck
 ... 4.1.2 failed: Instrumentation run failed due to 'java.lang.IllegalAccessError' :EspressoApp:connectedCheck I created a simple demo of this here: https://github.com/mwolfe38/android-espresso-dagger Just clone and then from command line run: gradle connectedCheck In the above I have tried the dependencies several different ways, originally like this: dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+'
    compile 'com.squareup.dagger:dagger-compiler:1.1.0'
    compile 'com.squareup.dagger:dagger:1.1.0'

    instrumentTestCompile files('libs/espresso-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar',
            'libs/testrunner-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar',
            'libs/testrunner-runtime-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar')
    instrumentTestCompile 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-all:1.3'
    instrumentTestCompile 'com.google.guava:guava:15.0'
}
 but that gives me an error regarding static initialization. This appears to be caused by some static initialization code in the espresso framework regarding dagger. So After adding dagger dependencies to instrumentTestCompile I get the IllegalAccessError mentioned above. Anyone have luck including dagger in your project and doing espresso tests?
@CODE:gradle connectedCheck dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+'
    compile 'com.squareup.dagger:dagger-compiler:1.1.0'

@CONTENT:Up to recently the web scraping of HP warranty information worked fine, however in the last couple of weeks they have changed the web page and it seems they are using POST rather than GET now on the new page, meaning I can't really just pass the information to the URL. I did find some hope in a solution on this page: http://ocdnix.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/hp-server-warranty-via-the-isee-api/ But I don't understand the example script as I have not worked with Python before. I also found this web page that shows me a good example for Dell warranty, But HP don't have a WSDL that I could work with.

 I can use AVAudioSessionPortDescription -setPreferredDataSource:error: to record from one of the three. But I cannot record on more than one simultaneously. If I set the number of input channels to 2, I get two identical tracks from the same microphone. AVAudioRecorder has a property channelAssignments which seems like it should work, but AVAudioSession inputNumberOfChannels and maximumInputNumberOfChannels are both 1. The property channelAssignments is designed for auxiliary microphones which have multiple channels. I tried using the low-level AudioUnit, but I get the same result. I could not find any properties on AudioUnit to change the input source. Any help would be appreciated.

@LINK:/questions/19391872/how-to-compile-a-single-java-file-with-gradle
@TITLE:How to compile a single java file with gradle?
@CONTENT:(UPDATED: Thanks to comments from Peter N below.) I have a java package with several classes and therefore files within it. However I only want to compile one of those files initially so that I can then use it to update the other classes in the package. It's a factory for the other classes and as a result is dependent on them - ie. it has references to them. I've been attempting to use a JavaCompile gradle task to do this. As a result I've read the documentation for JavaCompile and attempted to search for examples but seems there is very little out there. I've even posted on the gradle forums, but slow going so far. I'm able to do what is required readily with an ant script using the ant javac task. But I'd like to do it in gradle (and without using the ant.javac method - if I have to do that I'll just use ant). I've created an example case with just two source files for two classes in the one package. Both files are in a package called some.pkg and we therefore have the following directory structure: .\build.gradle .\src\main\java\some\pkg\ClassOne.java .\src\main\java\some\pkg\ClassTwo.java ClassOne: package some.pkg;

import some.pkg.*;

public class ClassOne {
    public void doStuff() {
    }
}
 ClassTwo: package some.pkg;

import some.pkg.*;

public class ClassTwo {
    public void ClassTwo() {
        ClassOne cone = new ClassOne();
        cone.doStuff();
    }
}
 As you can see, ClassTwo (our class we want to compile standalone) depends on ClassOne. The ant script is a simple case of: <project>
    <property name="build.dir"     value="build"/>
    <property name="lib.dir"     value="lib"/>
    <property name="src.dir"     value="src/main/java"/>
    <target name="generate" >
        <mkdir dir="${build.dir}"/>
        <javac source="1.6" target="1.6" srcdir="${src.dir}" destdir="${build.dir}" 
               debug="true" includeantruntime="false"
               includes="some/pkg/ClassTwo.java">
        </javac>
    </target>
</project>
 But in gradle, I keep having an issue where javac (or JavaCompile task) can not find ClassOne. It's as though the sourcedir is not pointing where it should - and indeed as though I was just running javac on the command line. I was thinking the gradle 'JavaCompile' task's 'source' property was working like the ant 'srcdir' property, but that appears to not be the case. So here is the gradle script I'm currently trying: apply plugin: 'java'

task compileOne (type: JavaCompile) {
    source = sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs
    include 'some/pkg/ClassTwo.java'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.compileClasspath
    destinationDir = sourceSets.main.output.classesDir
}
 But it results in: C:\test\>gradle generate
:generate
C:\test\src\main\java\some\pkg\ClassTwo.java:7: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class ClassOne
location: class some.pkg.ClassTwo
                ClassOne cone = new ClassOne();
                ^

                                    ^
2 errors
:generate FAILED
 So how do I achieve an ant javac equivalent in gradle? ant javac seems to have the smarts to go and compile all the other related classes, but I guess for gradle JavaCompile I will need to set up a sourceSet to do that.. not sure.. Thanks!

@TITLE:AngularJS Custom Directive Two Way Binding
@CONTENT:If I have an AngularJS directive without a template and I want it to set a property on the current scope, what is the best way to do it? For example, a directive that counts button clicks: <button twoway="counter">Click Me</button>
<p>Click Count: {{ counter }}</p>
 With a directive that assigns the click count to the expression in the two way attribute: .directive('twoway', [
'$parse',
  function($parse) {
    return {
      scope: false,
      link: function(scope, elem, attrs) {
        elem.on('click', function() {
          var current = scope.$eval(attrs.twoway) || 0;
          $parse(attrs.twoway).assign(scope, ++current);
          scope.$apply();
        });
      }
    };
  }
])
 Is there a better way to do this? From what I've read, an isolated scope would be overkill, but do I need a child scope? And is there a cleaner way to write back to a scope variable defined in the directive attribute other than using $parse. I just feel like I'm making this too difficult. Full Plunker here.
@CODE:<button twoway="counter">Click Me</button>
<p>Click Count: {{ counter }}</p> .directive('twoway', [
'$parse',
  function($parse) {
    return {
      scope: false,
      link: function(scope, elem, attrs) {
        elem.on('click', function() {
          var current = scope.$eval(attrs.twoway) || 0;
          $parse(attrs.twoway).assign(scope, ++current);
          scope.$apply();
        });
      }
    };
  }
]) $parse

@CONTENT:I am writing a bash script that runs a command line program (Gromacs), saves the results, modifies the input files, and then loops through the process again. I am trying to use VIM to modify the input text files, but I have not been able to find a way to execute internal VIM commands like :1234, w, x, dd, ect. from the .sh file after opening my input files in VIM ("vim conf.gro").

@TITLE:Sortable table columns with AngularJs
@CONTENT:I'm trying to sort a table of data which is populated from a JSON source. The code I have is as follows: HTML: <div ng-app="myApp">
    <div ng-controller="PurchasesCtrl">
        <table cellspacing="0">
            <tr class="first">
                <th class="first" ng:click="changeSorting(purchases.date)">Date</th>

                <td>{{purchase.availability}}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</div>
 JS: var myApp = angular.module("myApp",[]);

myApp.factory("Purchases", function(){
    var Purchases = {};

    Purchases.data = [
        {
            date: "10/05/2012",
            text: "1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ipsum dolor",

        },
        {
            date: "24/05/2012",
            text: "2 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ipsum dolor",
            price: "?234.56",
            availability: "2 Available until 10th Dec 2013"
        },
        {
            date: "20/05/2012",
            text: "3 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ipsum dolor",
            price: "?345.67",
            availability: "3 Available until 10th Dec 2013"
        }
    ];
    return Purchases;
});

function PurchasesCtrl($scope, Purchases){
    $scope.purchases = Purchases;

    $scope.changeSorting = function(column) {
        var sort = $scope.sort;

        if (sort.column == column) {
            sort.descending = !sort.descending;
        } else {
            sort.column = column;
            sort.descending = false;
        }
    };
}
 Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7czsM/1/ As you can see I've tried to add a click function to the table headers to call a function that sorts the data, but it's not working. I've seen an example of this kind of thing which does work, here: http://jsfiddle.net/vojtajina/js64b/14/, but when I try to apply the same kind of thing to my scenario it breaks very quickly; for example, I tried adding the table headers programatically in JSON by adding the following: var Purchases = {};

Purchases.head = [
        {
            date: "Date",
            text: "Text column",
            price: "Price column",
            availability: "Availability column"
        }

    Purchases.data = [
        {
            date: "10/05/2012",
            text: "1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ipsum dolor",
            price: "?123.45",
            availability: "1 Available until 10th Dec 2013"
        },
 This just prevents anything from working, but I thought it would be possible to add multiple sets of data to an Angular variable? I'm a total new-comer to Angular so I'm really stuck with this. Any pointers would be much appreciated, thanks.

@LINK:/questions/18671572/multiple-stacked-full-width-background-images-with-bootstrap-3-0
@TITLE:Multiple stacked full-width background images with Bootstrap 3.0
@CONTENT:I'm trying to put together a static webpage using Bootstrap 3.0. The page is basically a narrative, and consists of a series of stacked sections with background images, with text and other images/elements overlaid on top. The page is just designed to be scrolled from top to bottom, and each section's background image should fill the horizontal width. Later on, I'll also be adding parallax with the images using Skrollr (https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr). However, right now, I'm struggling to get working HTML/CSS with Bootstrap. Initially, I thought I could do something like this: <body>
<div class="container">
    <section id="first">
        <div class="row annoucement col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
            <h1>The story of...</h1>
        </div>
    </section
    <section id="second">
        <div class="row gallery col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
            <!-- Image gallery boxes -->
        </div>
    </section
</div>
 and then in the CSS:     #first {
        background: url(img/1.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
        -webkit-background-size: cover;
        -moz-background-size: cover;
        -o-background-size: cover;
        background-size: cover;
    }
 However, the background images aren't visible - the #first element is 1140px x 0px, so the image isn't showing. I suspect I'm not using the tag types correctly - any suggestions of how I can get the above layout working with Bootstrap?
@CODE:<body>
<div class="container">
    <section id="first">
        <div class="row annoucement col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
            <h1>The story of...</h1>
        </div>
    </section
    <section id="second">
        <div class="row gallery col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
            <!-- Image gallery boxes -->

@TITLE:PrimeFaces autocomplete: itemSelect versus change events
@CONTENT:I need to trigger an ajax update upon change to a text box, which is a <p:autoComplete> component. I have observed that if the user opts to type the text manually, the event is a change, whereas if the user clicks one of the suggestions for the autocomplete, the event is itemSelect. So I added two <p:ajax> children to the input, each calling the same method and having the same update list, but one having event="change" and the other event="itemSelect". However, I now discover something odd. For example, while in normal server mode I opened my page and typed "12". The autocomplete offered "1233" and "1234" as suggestions. I clicked "1233" and seemingly nothing happened. I clicked again and everything else filled in. Repeat this in the debugger with a breakpoint on the event handler, and I can see that after the first click, the value is "12" and on the second click, it becomes "1233". By switching commenting out the two different <p:ajax> I can see the different consequences. Without the "change" one, the handler is never called if the user selects an autocomplete suggestion, and without the "itemSelect" one, the handler is never called if the user types manually. But with both of them, there are two calls, and I'm sure there will be complaints about the double-click. Some pseudo-code for those that like, first the xhtml: <p:autoComplete id="itemId" value="#{myBacker.myBean.itemNumber}"
    required="true" completeMethod="#{myBacker.idAutoComplete}">
    <p:ajax event="itemSelect" update="beanDetails"
        listener="#{myBacker.idChangeEventListener()}" />
    <p:ajax event="change" update="beanDetails"
        listener="#{myBacker.idChangeEventListener()}" />
</p:autoComplete>
<h:panelGroup id="beanDetails">
    <h:panelGroup rendered="#{not empty myBacker.myBean.institutionName}">
        <h:outputText value="#{myBacker.myBean.institutionName}" />
        <!-- Continues with address, phone, etc..  -->
    </h:panelGroup>
</h:panelGroup>
 Then the Java backing bean code: public void idChangeEventListener() {
    myBean = myDAO.getDetails(myBean);
    //  another couple of init-type method calls
}
@CODE:<p:autoComplete> <p:ajax> event="change" event="itemSelect" <p:ajax> <p:autoComplete id="itemId" value="#{myBacker.myBean.itemNumber}"
    required="true" completeMethod="#{myBacker.idAutoComplete}">
    <p:ajax event="itemSelect" update="beanDetails"
        listener="#{myBacker.idChangeEventListener()}" />
    <p:ajax event="change" update="beanDetails"
        listener="#{myBacker.idChangeEventListener()}" />
</p:autoComplete>
<h:panelGroup id="beanDetails">
    <h:panelGroup rendered="#{not empty myBacker.myBean.institutionName}">
        <h:outputText value="#{myBacker.myBean.institutionName}" />
        <!-- Continues with address, phone, etc..  -->

    myBean = myDAO.getDetails(myBean);

@TITLE:Opencv kalman filter prediction without new observtion
@CONTENT:I wan to use Opencv Kalman filter implementation for smooth some noise points. So I've tried to code a simple test for it. Let's say I have an observation (a point). Each frame I'm receiving new observation, I call Kalman predict and Kalman correct. The state coming after opencv Kalman filter correct is "following the point", it is ok. Then let's say I have a missing observation, I want anyway the Kalman filter to be updated and predict the new state. Here my code is failing: if I call kalman.predict() the value is no more updated.

@TITLE:Google places autocomplete not working in Windows mobile IE Browser
@CONTENT:We are building a mobile site for our product ridingo. We use the google places autocomplete feature extensively on our site. This is used to provide suggestions to users as they type. We tested this across multiple browsers and on devices. This is working fine in Android devices and IOS. But, on Windows mobile (OS Version 8, IE browser), the autocomplete/autopopulate list is almost unusable Problems: We are unable to touch the desired item on the autopopulate list. When touching it, it automatically closes the list (behavior similar to what we'd see when we press "ESC" button or click somewhere else on the window). Because of this, we cannot get any list item selected. The list gets rendered at a slightly lower place than the text box. This problem can be screen on the screenshot too.

I want to use this token to start a Facebook Session. I am using something like: FBSession* session = [[FBSession alloc] initWithPermissions:@[@"publish_actions"]];
FBAccessTokenData* tokenData = 
[FBAccessTokenData createTokenFromString:token
                             permissions:@[@"publish_actions"]
                          expirationDate:nil
                               loginType:FBSessionLoginTypeTestUser
                             refreshDate:nil];


[session openFromAccessTokenData:tokenData completionHandler:nil];
 I am here passing 'nil' for clarity, in my code I am handling the completion and loggin the session object returned which appears to be in an Open state with no errors. When I try and use the session I get an error like: Error Domain=com.facebook.sdk Code=5 "The operation couldn¡¦t be completed. (com.facebook.sdk error 5.)" UserInfo=0xb8b1680 {com.facebook.sdk:HTTPStatusCode=403, com.facebook.sdk:ParsedJSONResponseKey={

@LINK:/questions/17761896/why-explicitly-call-git-reset-soft-before-git-reset-mixed
@TITLE:Why explicitly call git reset --soft before git reset (--mixed)
@CONTENT:In the git docs (and numerous SO threads) this reset approach is recommended: $ git reset --soft HEAD^ ;# go back to WIP state  <2>
$ git reset                                       <3>
 .2. This removes the WIP commit from the commit history, and sets your working tree to the state just before you made that snapshot. .3. At this point the index file still has all the WIP changes you committed as snapshot WIP. This updates the index to show your WIP files as uncommitted. https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html Obviously that's fine, but it seems that these two commands could be replaced by $ git reset HEAD^
 (which is equivalent to) $ git reset --mixed HEAD^
 which should reset both the HEAD pointer and the index to the previous commit. Is there in fact a difference between the result of this command and the previous two? If not, is there some reason to prefer the two-stage process? Or was it just done that way in the docs to explicitly illustrate the behavior of --soft?
@CODE:$ git reset --soft HEAD^ ;# go back to WIP state  <2>
$ git reset                                       <3> $ git reset HEAD^ $ git reset --mixed HEAD^

 So it seems that item.key is a NSNumber object but the constants beginning with AVMetadataiTunesMetadataKey... are NSString objects. What's the right way to get the metadata? When i use [AVAsset commonMetadata] the keys are NSString objects too and the comparison with the AVMetadataCommonKey... constants works as expected.

@TITLE:Backbone nested collection
@CONTENT:I have an app in backbone that retrieve data from a server. This data are hotels and foreach hotel I have more rooms. I have divided hotel into a json an room inside another json like this: hotel.json [
  {
    "id": "1", 
    "name": "Hotel1"
  }, 
  {
    "id": "2", 
    "name": "Hotel2"
  }, 
  {
    "id": "3", 
    "name": "Hotel3"
  }
]
 rooms.json [
  {
    "id" : "r1",
    "hotel_id" : "1",
    "name" : "Singola",
    "level" : "1"
  },
  {
    "id" : "r1_1",
    "hotel_id" : "1",
    "name" : "Doppia",
    "level" : "2"
  },
  {
    "id" : "r1_3",
    "hotel_id" : "1",
    "name" : "Doppia Uso singol",
    "level" : "1"
  },
  {
    "id" : "r2",
    "hotel_id" : "2",
    "name" : "Singola",
    "level" : "1"
  },
  {
    "id" : "r2_1",
    "hotel_id" : "2",
    "name" : "Tripla",
    "level" : "1"
  }
]
 I wanna take each hotel and combine with its rooms(external key into rooms.json hotel_id) and print the combination of the rooms: foreach level combine different rooms. One rooms of level 1 one rooms of level2 and one rooms of level3. Maximum of level is 3 but I can have only one level or only two level. If I have 3 level I don't want combination of level1 and level2 without level3 Something like this Room "Single", "level" : "1" , "hotel_id" : "1"
Room "Double", "level" : "2" , , "hotel_id" : "1"
Room "Triple", "level" : "3" , , "hotel_id" : "1"
 Room "Double for single", "level" : "1" , "hotel_id" : "1"
Room "Double", "level" : "2" , , "hotel_id" : "1"
Room "Triple", "level" : "3" , , "hotel_id" : "1"
 The constructor of this rooms I think is to put into renderRooms into my app. This is my app: var Room = Backbone.Model.extend();
        var Rooms = Backbone.Collection.extend({
            model:Room,
            url : "includes/rooms.json"
        });
        var Hotel = Backbone.Model.extend({

                return {
                    "id": "1", 
                    "name": "Hotel1",
                    "rooms": []
                }
            }
        });
        var HotelCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
            model: Hotel,
            url: "includes/test-data.json",
            initialize: function(){
                console.log("Collection Hotel initialize");
            }    
        });
        var HotelView = Backbone.View.extend({ 
            template: _.template($("#hotel-list-template").html()),
            initialize: function(){ 
                this.collection = new HotelCollection();
                this.collection.bind('sync', this.render, this);
                this.collection.fetch();

        });

        var hotelView = new HotelView({

@TITLE:Use both http and https for socket.io
@CONTENT:I am trying to make socket.io work both on http and https connections, but it seems that with my configuration it can work only on one of them. With the below config options socket.io can access my application through https, but when trying to access through regular http it cannot connect and i receive errors.     var app = express()
  , http= require('http').createServer(app)
  , https = require('https').createServer(options, app)
  , io = require('socket.io').listen(https, { log: false })
 And later i have this http.listen(80, serverAddress);
https.listen(443, serverAddress);
 On client side i have this: <script src='/socket.io/socket.io.js'></script>

var socket = io.connect('https://<%= serverAddress %>', {secure: true, 'sync disconnect on unload' : true});
 Of course if i switch the http with the https options on the .listen and .connect functions of the server and the client respectively i am having the reverse results. Socket.io can access through http and not through https. How is it possible to achieve this? I need it mostly because it is about a facebook app, so it must provide both http and https connection options according to facebook rules. Edit: In case it helps about the problem, the error i am receiving is the below Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://DOMAIN/socket.io/socket.io.js
 And because of this i get others such as: Uncaught ReferenceError: io is not defined
@CODE:http https https http var app = express()
  , http= require('http').createServer(app)
  , https = require('https').createServer(options, app)
  , io = require('socket.io').listen(https, { log: false }) http.listen(80, serverAddress);

@TITLE:State of the art Culling and Batching techniques in rendering
@CONTENT:I'm currently working with upgrading and restructuring an OpenGL render engine. The engine is used for visualising large scenes of architectural data (buildings with interior), and the amount of objects can become rather large. As is the case with any building, there is a lot of occluded objects within walls, and you naturally only see the objects that are in the same room as you, or the exterior if you are on the outside. This leaves a large number of objects that should be occluded through occlusion culling and frustum culling. At the same time there is a lot of repetative geometry that can be batched in renderbatches, and also a lot of objects that can be rendered with instanced rendering. The way I see it, it can be difficult to combine renderbatching and culling in an optimal fashion. If you batch too many objects in the same VBO it's difficult to cull the objects on the CPU in order to skip rendering that batch. At the same time if you skip the culling on the cpu, a lot of objects will be processed by the GPU while they are not visible. If you skip batching copletely in order to more easily cull on the CPU, there will be an unwanted high amount of render calls. I have done some research into existing techniques and theories as to how these problems are solved in modern graphics, but I have not been able to find any concrete solution. An idea a colleague and me came up with was restricting batches to objects relatively close to eachother e.g all chairs in a room or within a radius of n meeters. This could be simplified and optimized through use of oct-trees. Does anyone have any pointers to techniques used for scene managment, culling, batching etc in state of the art modern graphics engines?

@TITLE:I have a POCO, can I get a proxy from the DbContext?
@CONTENT:I have a model that I get from a POST request. Since my view defines its POCO type, the object created from the submitted data is also a POCO. Being a POCO, it doesn't have various virtual properties overridden. Therefore, those virtual properties return null. This, in turn, means that I have to make separate queries based on the foreign keys to navigate through its properties (if I want to do anything more complex than just saving it). Can I, given the POCO of my model, get the proxy that has all the overridden functionality? (I had assumed that this is what db.Entry().Entity was for, but it still returns me the POCO object, not the proxy. I'm inspecting the runtime type of the object by mouse-over during breakpoint pauses.)

@TITLE:How to solve circular dependency in Require.js?
@CONTENT:Basically, the idea is that "sub" module creates an object, and that object should be part of a utilities library which is the "main" module. However, the "sub" object depends on utilities from "main": // Main module
define(['sub'], function(sub) {
    var utils = {
        utilityMain: function () {
           // ...
        };
        // ...
    };

    tools.subModule = sub;

    return tools;
});

// Sub module
define(['main'], function(main) {
    return new (function () {

        // Singleton object using functions in main module
        var somestuff = function () {
            main.utilityMain();
            // etc
        };
    })();
});   
 How can I achieve this with require.js without creating a black hole that would swallow the whole planet? Thank you very much.

@TITLE:ASP.NET WebAPI: Generic controller for OData endpoint
@CONTENT:I'm currently experimenting with OData endpoints in ASP.NET MVC 4 Web API. I like the concept and try to come up with efficient ways to use it in our project. One question I have is the following: we have a service that is able to return an IQueryable and takes the name of an entity as Input: public IQueryable GetAll(string entityName);
 In standard Web API (as opposed to OData Controllers) I can create a generic controller, that can be called in the form /api/entities/{entityName} and returns the IQueryable. In case of an OData Controller, I carry out the following entity-specific steps: Register the entities in the model. Create a separate Controller for each entity that derives from EntitySetController<>. I want to use the generic service and avoid as much entity-specific implementations as possible. The first step can easily be automated if the service can return a list of the entities and the corresponding types. That leaves step 2, because up to now I need to create a specific controller for each entity. I also want to avoid that and create a generic controller that uses the generic service. Can anyone recommend a solution, maybe by influencing OData routing?

@TITLE:Embed python into fortran 90
@CONTENT:I was looking at the option of embedding python into fortran90 to add python functionality to my existing fortran90 code. I know that it can be done the other way around by extending python with fortran90 using the f2py from numpy. But, i want to keep my super optimized main loop in fortran and add python to do some additional tasks / evaluate further developments before I can do it in fortran, and also to ease up code maintenance. I am looking for answers for the following questions: 1) Is there a library that already exists from which I can embed python into fortran? (I am aware of f2py and it does it the other way around) 2) How do we take care of data transfer from fortran to python and back? 3) How can we have a call back functionality implemented? (Let me describe the scenario a bit....I have my main_fortran program in Fortran, that call Func1_Python module in python. Now, from this Func1_Python, I want to call another function...say Func2_Fortran in fortran) 4) What would be the impact of embedding the interpreter of python inside fortran in terms of performance....like loading time, running time, sending data (a large array in double precision) across etc. Thanks a lot in advance for your help!! Edit1: I want to set the direction of the discussion right by adding some more information about the work I am doing. I am into scientific computing stuff. So, I would be working a lot on huge arrays / matrices in double precision and doing floating point operations. So, there are very few options other than fortran really to do the work for me. The reason i want to include python into my code is that I can use NumPy for doing some basic computations if necessary and extend the capabilities of the code with minimal effort. For example, I can use several libraries available to link between python and some other package (say OpenFoam using PyFoam library).

@TITLE:collapse intersecting regions in R
@CONTENT:I am trying to find a way to collapse rows with intersecting ranges, denoted by "start" and "stop" columns, and record the collapsed values into new columns. For example I have this data frame: my.df<- data.frame(chrom=c(1,1,1,1,14,16,16), name=c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g"), start=as.numeric(c(0,70001,70203,70060, 40004, 50000872, 50000872)), stop=as.numeric(c(71200,71200,80001,71051, 42004, 50000890, 51000952)))


chrom name  start   stop
 1    a        0    71200
 1    b    70001    71200
 1    c    70203    80001
 1    d    70060    71051

16    f 50000872 50000890
16    g 50000872 51000952
 And I am trying to find the overlapping ranges and record the biggest range covered by the collapsed overlapping rows in "start" and "stop" and the names of the collapsed rows, so I would get this: chrom start   stop      name
 1    70001    80001    a,b,c,d
14    40004    42004    e
16    50000872 51000952 f,g
 I think I could use the packages IRanges like this: library(IRanges)
ranges <- split(IRanges(my.df$start, my.df$stop), my.df$chrom)
 But then I have trouble getting the collapsed columns: I have tried with findOvarlaps but this ov <- findOverlaps(ranges, ranges, type="any")
 but I don't think this is right. Any help would be extremely appreciated. Thank you! -fra

@CONTENT:I have my User Object which I am trying to bind to UI with spring MVC. User Object has another object Address in it. public class User {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
    String userName;
    Address address;
}
 Address obj. public class Address {
    String street;
    String House;
    String country;
}
 When I bind user object to UI say for edit user functionality I only want to keep firstName and lastName. Now my first question if I don't keep rest of the properties of the User as hidden field I am getting those values null. It means the binding object on UI is a new instance of the User object.. Can't I work on the same user object and bind it on UI and get only updated values with old value? Secondly: by hidden field method I am not getting Address object back, I am getting null for that <form:hidden path="user.address" />
 Where user is my modal attribute. I don't know, there might be a gap my understanding of Spring MVC. For binding object on UI do we always have to create new instance? If nested how do we get nested objects (Address) back in binded modal attributes ? Once option I guess is using binders. But as far as I understand, binder will also fetch object using id?? Kindly give the workaround where I can save my query to fetch that object back

@TITLE:How can I send cookies using PHP curl in addition to CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE?
@CONTENT:I am scraping some content from a website after a form submission. The problem is that the script is failing every now and then, say 2 times out of 5 the script fails. I am using php curl, COOKIEFILE and COOKIEJAR to handle the cookie. However when I observed the sent headers of my browser (when visiting the target website from my browser and using live http headers) and the headers sent by php and saw there are many differences. My browser sent a lot more cookie variables than php curl. I think this difference might be because javascript is resposible for setting most of the cookies, however I'm not sure about this. I am using the below code to do the scraping and I am showing the sent headers of my browser and of php curl: $ckfile = tempnam ("/tmp", 'cookiename');

$url = 'https://www.domain.com/firststep';
$poststring = 'variable1=4&variable2=5';
$ch = curl_init ($url);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, $ckfile);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, $ckfile);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 30);

 Some of the parameters in the cookie above I might be able to scrape from the content of the website, but not all. Some of them I might be able to read from the $ckfile, but I don't know how to do that. Especially the utma utmc, utmz, utmcsr, utmccn, utmcmd I am not able to get from anywhere, I think these are generated by the javascript. Question 1: Am I doing something wrong with the cookie handling in the current code as very few cookie variables are sent by php curl and a lot more by the browser? Further: can other differences between sent headers by browser and php curl be a problem to return the right content? Question 2: Are the missing cookie variables due to the javascript setting those cookies? Question 3: What is the best way to handle the cookies to make sure that all required cookies are being sent to the remote server? Your help is very welcome!

@TITLE:Entity Framework Code First: SaveChanges is not atomic
@CONTENT:I have the following very simple unit test that reproduces a case where DbContext.SaveChanges is not atomic. By not atomic I mean that the committed data can be read before all the commit was completed. Add task: In a loop, adds a new TestEntity and a ReferencingEntity. Validate task: checks if there is a TestEntity that is not referenced by any ReferencingEntity - that is not supposed to happen because of the way I add the entities. The unit test fails... any advice? EDIT: According to the accepted answer - In order to run the unit test with the proposed solution add in the InitTest method: using (var context = new TestContext())
{
    var objectContext = (context as IObjectContextAdapter).ObjectContext;
    objectContext.ExecuteStoreCommand(string.Format("ALTER DATABASE [{0}] SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON", context.GetType().FullName));

@TITLE:Installing PostgreSQL 9.2 with Chef postgresql
@CONTENT:I am struggling to get PostgreSQL 9.2 installed with the Opscode postgresql cookbook on a Vagrant VM (Ubuntu 12.04) . This is the my recipe: node.set['postgresql']['version']             = "9.2"

 I am using the latest 3.0.0 version of the poostgresql cookbook. Rerunning everything from scratch with a clean VM (vagrant destroy, up, etc) gives this error: [2013-05-23T11:16:37+00:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::EnclosingDirectoryDoesNotExist:

@TITLE:Entity Framework Code First: SaveChanges is not atomic
@CONTENT:I have the following very simple unit test that reproduces a case where DbContext.SaveChanges is not atomic. By not atomic I mean that the committed data can be read before all the commit was completed. Add task: In a loop, adds a new TestEntity and a ReferencingEntity. Validate task: checks if there is a TestEntity that is not referenced by any ReferencingEntity - that is not supposed to happen because of the way I add the entities. The unit test fails... any advice? EDIT: According to the accepted answer - In order to run the unit test with the proposed solution add in the InitTest method: using (var context = new TestContext())
{
    var objectContext = (context as IObjectContextAdapter).ObjectContext;
    objectContext.ExecuteStoreCommand(string.Format("ALTER DATABASE [{0}] SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON", context.GetType().FullName));

I've successfully had git functioning behind a proxy before, and have read other stackoverflow related to git and proxy usage. Now I've configured it on a host in my current organization to use a non-authenticating proxy, but it's timing out. the proxy is squid, non-authenticating directly connecting via TCP-443 is not an option I've confirmed that git is contacting the proxy Git issues the command "CONNECT github.com:443 HTTP/1.1" The proxy allows the request and connects to github.com on port 443 libcurl verifies github's cert and establishes an SSL connection (SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA) git proceeds to sit there, waiting for something that never happens timeout occurs Has anyone experienced this before?

@TITLE:Performance testing with PhantomJS
@CONTENT:I am using Google soy templates and have developed both Server-side and client-side rendering solutions. I want to benchmark them using performance tests. While benchmarking the client-side part, I want to wait till all the javascript actions are performed to calculate the actual response time. I had tried below but it doesn't solve my purpose. PhantomJS supports accessing single page and querying required information on the page, but is doesn't provide any option to simulate the concurrent connections Nodeload, provides the ability to load test a server, but doesn't have any option to retrieve the information from the page. Is there are other framework that I can use to do both Load testing as well as page scraping?

@TITLE:Combining Neo4J and MongoDB : Consistency
@CONTENT:I am experimenting a lot these days, and one of the things I wanted to do is combine two popular NoSQL databases, namely Neo4j and MongoDB. Simply because I feel they complement eachother perfectly. The first class citizens in Neo4j, the relations, are imo exactly what's missing in MongoDB, whereas MongoDb allows me to not put large amounts of data in my node properties. So I am trying to combine the two in a Java application, using the Neo4j Java REST binding, and the MongoDB Java driver. All my domain entities have a unique identifier which I store in both databases. The other data is stored in MongoDB and the relations between entities are stored in Neo4J. For instance, both databases contain a userid, MongoDB contains the profile information, and Neo4J contains friendship relations. With the custom data access layer I have written, this works exactly like I want it to. And it's fast. BUT... When I want to create a user, I need to create both a node in Neo4j and a document in MongoDB. Not necessarily a problem, except that Neo4j is transactional and MongoDB is not. If both were transactional, I would just roll back both transactions when one of them fails. But since MongoDB isn't transactional, I cannot do this. How do I ensure that whenever I create a user, either both a Node and Document are created, or none of both. I don't want to end up with a bunch of documents that have no matching node. On top of that, not only do I want my combined database interaction to be ACID compliant, I also want it to be threadsafe. Both the GraphDatabaseService and the MongoClient / DB are provided from singletons. I found something about creating "Transaction Documents" in MongoDB, but I realy don't like that approach. I would like something nice and clean like the neo4j beginTx, tx.success, tx.failure, tx.finish setup. Ideally, something I can implement in the same try/catch/finally block. Should I perhaps make a switch to CouchDB, which does appear to be transactional? Edit : After some more research, sparked by a comment, I came to realize that CouchDB is also not suitable for my specific needs. To clarify, the Neo4j part is set in stone. The Document Store database is not as long as it has a Java Library.

I now the question is basic, but it will help me to better understand the data table way of thinking! A similar question was asked here! However, the solution seems to pertain to either reclassing just one column or all columns. My question is unique to a select few columns. ### Load package

### Create pseudo data
data <- data.table(id     = 1:10,
                   height = rnorm(10, mean = 182, sd = 20),
                   weight = rnorm(10, mean = 160, sd = 10),
                   color  = rep(c('blue', 'gold'), times = 5))

### Reclass all columns
data <- data[, lapply(.SD, as.character)]

### Search for columns to be reclassed
index <- grep('(id)|(height)|(weight)', names(data))

### data frame method
df <- data.frame(data)
df[, index] <- lapply(df[, index], as.numeric)

### Failed attempt to reclass columns used the data.table method
data <- data[, lapply(index, as.character), with = F]
 Any help would be appreciated. My data are large and so using regular expressions to create a vector of column numbers to reclassify is necessary. Thank you for your time.

@TITLE:Intellij multi-module maven project, update in one of the submodules is not propogated to war
@CONTENT:I'm using Intellij Idea 12 and have a multi module maven project. To make it simple let's assume that I have: Module A - compiled to JAR Module B - depending on module A and also compiled to JAR Module C - depending on module B, but compiled to WAR I know Intellij has it's own build mechanism for maven projects so when I build a WAR for the first time and deploy it to Tomcat generally all works as it should. The problem start when you need to make changes in one of the sub modules, for example Module A and rebuild the War (rebuild Module C) Intellij as it seems uses the old Module A jar that was previously build and ignores any changes I made in Module A when making/building Module C. The only way I found to solve this is to run a Maven build on Module A and B and initiallly build the WAR with Maven and deploy it as external source. The problem is that I have 10 WARs I want to deploy and more then 20 sub modules that compiled to jars. It doesn't make sense to rebuild all wars when I'm only want to see the changes I made in one of sub modules that affects one WAR. And sure doesn't make sense to build them externally with command line while paying for Intellij Ultimate license (so I can work with Application servers) Now comparing this behavior to other IDE 1. Netbeans works with maven projects naturally via Maven and all builds/deployments and such are done with Maven and not by some internal mechanism. 2. Eclipse does the same with it's internal mechanism but all JARs are updated when WAR project are rebuild. (Or some other magic that works) Is there a way work differently with IDEA or there isn't ?

@TITLE:Particle filter for multi object tracking
@CONTENT:I'm on people tracking in computer vision. I have observations (blob as output of blob detection after background subtraction) and i want to infer the objects that have produced this observations. I have troubled with some kalman filter code. And it's quite clear to me, but my problem is multi object tracking: my problem is that sometimes the observations are incomplete/noisy. Let's explain me better. In a test with clear observations i have 1 blob for each person. Kalman filter can help me in smoothing the noisy path of the person into a smoothed curve. But this is not my problem. The problem is that sometimes blob detection is not perfect and I have 2 blobs for 1 person (for example if the person i want to track is dressing a t-shirt of the same color of the background) or sometimes I have 1 blob for 2 persons (for example if the 2 persons are hugging themself or are too near each other). I have searched some theory and I have found a tons of papers that are solving the problem of object tracking with particle filter. So I studied a lot on bayesian filter, monte carlo method, importance sampling and it is a little bit clear (I don't have math knowledge on probability to understand everything but the idea is clear). Anyway I don't still understand how particle filter can help me in detecting cases where 2 blobs correspond to 1 object or 1 blob correspond to 2 objects. Can someone help in understanding this problem?

@TITLE:Angular.js: Wrapping elements in a nested transclude
@CONTENT:This seems like such a simple thing, but I am just not able to wrap my head around how to do it. Here is what I want: <my-buttons>
  <my-button ng-click="doOneThing()">abc</my-button>
  <my-button ng-click="doAnotherThing()">def</my-button>
</my-buttons>
 That turns into something like this: <ul class="u">
  <li class="l"><button ng-click="doOneThing()">abc</button></li>
  <li class="l"><button ng-click="doAnotherThing()">def</button></li>
</ul>
 Notice how the ng-click is on the button, inside a wrapping li. However, the normal transclusion will place the ng-click on the li. My best try is on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/WTv7k/1/ There I have replaced the ng-click with a class, so it is easy to see when it works and not. Any ideas of how to get this done? If it is really easy, maybe the tabs/pane example on the frontpage could be expanded to include a wrapper around the panes, while still keeping the attributes.
@CODE:<my-buttons>
  <my-button ng-click="doOneThing()">abc</my-button>

@CONTENT:e.g. "23:55:00" I'm in the process of converting a bus schedule database from Postgres to Mongo. Postgres has a time without timezone datatype that I'm using to store stop times, and I'm having difficulty trying to figure out how to migrate that. It doesn't seem to make much sense giving it an arbitrary year/month/day to convert it into a javascript Date object, but I do plan on doing some simple calculations with the times after the data gets parsed, to show stuff like 'next stopping time', so if I store it as a string I'll still have to convert it to something eventually to do comparisons I'm really new to MongoDB and any advice would be greatly appreciated

@LINK:/questions/15744630/whats-the-correct-way-to-trigger-jquery-dom-manipulation-from-within-a-controll
@TITLE:What's the correct way to trigger jQuery DOM Manipulation from within a controller?
@CONTENT:So I keep reading that jQuery manipulation from within a Controller is bad practice, but I'm not clear on why, or how to correct. Below is code from a Youtube tutorial which even the video creator comments is a bad idea, but doesn't explain why and continues to use the bad behavior anyway. From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilCH2Euobz0#t=553s : $scope.delete = function() {
    var id = this.todo.Id;
    Todo.delete({id: id}, function() {
        $('todo_' + id).fadeOut();
    });
};
 SOLUTION: Based on Langdon's answer below, I've arrived at the following working code for my own work, which derives slightly from the example code above: var ProjectListCtrl = function ($scope, Project) {
    $scope.projects = Project.query();
    $scope.delete = function() {
        var thisElem = this;
        var thisProject = thisElem.project;
        var id = thisProject.id;
        Project.delete({id: id}, function() {
            var idx = $scope.projects.indexOf(thisProject);
            if (idx !== -1) {
                thisElem.destroy('removeItem('+idx+')');
            }
        });
    }

    $scope.removeItem = function(idx) {
        $scope.projects.splice(idx, 1);
    }

}

app.directive('fadeOnDestroy', function() {
    return function(scope, elem) {
        scope.destroy = function(funcComplete) {
            elem.fadeOut({
                complete: function() {
                    scope.$apply(funcComplete)
                }
            });
        }
    }
});
 This differs from Langdon's answer in a few ways. I wanted to avoid adding a parameter to the ngClick callback, so I'm storing it in thisProject. Also, the example and my code needs to call destroy from within a $http success callback so instead of this which is no longer relevant, I'm storing the clicked element in thisElem. UPDATE 2: Updated my solution further to reflect that funcComplete was not actually modifying the original $scope.
@CODE:$scope.delete = function() {
    var id = this.todo.Id;
    Todo.delete({id: id}, function() {
        $('todo_' + id).fadeOut();
    });
}; var ProjectListCtrl = function ($scope, Project) {
    $scope.projects = Project.query();
    $scope.delete = function() {
        var thisElem = this;
        var thisProject = thisElem.project;
        var id = thisProject.id;
        Project.delete({id: id}, function() {
            var idx = $scope.projects.indexOf(thisProject);
            if (idx !== -1) {
                thisElem.destroy('removeItem('+idx+')');
            }
        });
    }

    $scope.removeItem = function(idx) {
        $scope.projects.splice(idx, 1);
    }

}

app.directive('fadeOnDestroy', function() {
    return function(scope, elem) {
        scope.destroy = function(funcComplete) {
            elem.fadeOut({
                complete: function() {
                    scope.$apply(funcComplete)
                }
            });

@TITLE:Mediacodec and camera, color space incorrect
@CONTENT:By referring Aegonis's work 1 and work 2, I also got the H.264 stream , but the color is not correct. I am using HTC Butterfly for development. Here is part of my code: Camera: parameters.setPreviewSize(width, height);
parameters.setPreviewFormat(ImageFormat.YV12);
parameters.setPreviewFrameRate(frameRate);
 MediaCodec: mediaCodec = MediaCodec.createEncoderByType("video/avc");
MediaFormat mediaFormat = MediaFormat.createVideoFormat("video/avc", 320, 240);
mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_BIT_RATE, 500000);
mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_FRAME_RATE, 15);
mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_COLOR_FORMAT, MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar);
mediaFormat.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_I_FRAME_INTERVAL, 5);   
mediaCodec.configure(mediaFormat, null, null, MediaCodec.CONFIGURE_FLAG_ENCODE); 
mediaCodec.start();   
 When using COLOR_FormatYUV420Planar the error shows "[OMX.qcom.video.encoder.avc] does not support color format 19," so I can only use "COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar". Does anyone know the reason why no support? Got it, by using : int colorFormat = 0;
    MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities capabilities = codecInfo.getCapabilitiesForType(mimeType);
    for (int i = 0; i < capabilities.colorFormats.length && colorFormat == 0; i++) {
        int format = capabilities.colorFormats[i];
        Log.e(TAG, "Using color format " + format);           
    }
 we can have color format 21 (COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar) and 2130708361 (no corresponding format), I think the format will change depends on device. Then, I tried the color transform provided from the suggestions in work 1 and work 2: public static byte[] YV12toYUV420PackedSemiPlanar(final byte[] input, final byte[] output, final int width, final int height) {
    /* 
     * COLOR_TI_FormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar is NV12
     * We convert by putting the corresponding U and V bytes together (interleaved).
     */
    final int frameSize = width * height;
    final int qFrameSize = frameSize/4;

    System.arraycopy(input, 0, output, 0, frameSize); // Y

    for (int i = 0; i < qFrameSize; i++) {
        output[frameSize + i*2] = input[frameSize + i + qFrameSize]; // Cb (U)
        output[frameSize + i*2 + 1] = input[frameSize + i]; // Cr (V)
    }
    return output;
}

public static byte[] YV12toYUV420Planar(byte[] input, byte[] output, int width, int height) {
    /* 
     * COLOR_FormatYUV420Planar is I420 which is like YV12, but with U and V reversed.
     * So we just have to reverse U and V.
     */
    final int frameSize = width * height;
    final int qFrameSize = frameSize/4;

    System.arraycopy(input, 0, output, 0, frameSize); // Y
    System.arraycopy(input, frameSize, output, frameSize + qFrameSize, qFrameSize); // Cr (V)
    System.arraycopy(input, frameSize + qFrameSize, output, frameSize, qFrameSize); // Cb (U)

    return output;
}

public static byte[] swapYV12toI420(byte[] yv12bytes, int width, int height) {
    byte[] i420bytes = new byte[yv12bytes.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < width*height; i++)
        i420bytes[i] = yv12bytes[i];
    for (int i = width*height; i < width*height + (width/2*height/2); i++)
        i420bytes[i] = yv12bytes[i + (width/2*height/2)];

        i420bytes[i] = yv12bytes[i - (width/2*height/2)];
    return i420bytes;
}
 Obviously, the color transform of YV12toYUV420PackedSemiPlanar performs better than the other two. It is relatively better but still looks different in comparison with the real color. Is there something wrong with my code? Any comment will be appreciated.

The end result is that they all should have zero candies in minimum steps. Suppose we have 4 children with (-4, -2, 4, 2) candies then the sequence will be (-3, -2, 4, 1) (-2, -2, 4, 0) (-2, -1, 3, 0) (-2, 0, 2, 0) (-2, 1, 1, 0) (-2, 2, 0, 0) (-1, 1, 0, 0) ( 0, 0, 0, 0) This is one possible answer, I have to find minimum number of steps. Loop 1: find if a neighbor has positive candies,then give it to the neighbor with negative candies till number of candies is equal to zero and add the number of candies given to sum. Loop 2: find if a neighbors' neighbour has positive candies, then give it to the neighbor with negative candies till number of candies is equal to zero and add 2 (the number of candies given to sum). and so on.

@TITLE:Recording and playing back user actions on iOS simulator?
@CONTENT:I'd like to be able to play back a series of taps on the iOS simulator, ideally produced by recording these taps. If recording is not possible, then maybe I can do it in code, either within the program, or with an external program like AppleScript. Or perhaps with Instruments? Is any of this possible? I would need to be able to start playing user actions after starting an app.

@TITLE:Jquery adding and removing items from listbox
@CONTENT:I've created this fiddle, it allows the user to click on either art or video, dynamically populating the the second listbox with the list associated with those selections. There are two buttons, one to add the selection to the box, the other which removes the selection. What I would like to do is prevent the user from adding some that has already been added. The value of the options will all be Guids. Bonus points if you can modify the fiddle to use Guid instead of ints. I've tried this: $.each($("#SelectBox2 option:selected"), function (i, ob) {
    if (i == $(this).val()) {

    } else {
        inHTML += '<option value="' + $(this).val() + '">' + $(this).text() + '</option>';
    }
});
 I would like to enable the user to remove the selected items from the list. Thanks, UPDATE Just letting you guys know what the solution is that I came up with, I got the bonus points because i added GUID to it in a really smart way :) fiddle, I also tidied up the html to make it look nice and neat.

@CONTENT:I have a internet application mvc4 with areas, for my organization each area represent a SPA and through "Manage NuGet Package" I installed "Durandal 1.2.0", "Durandal Transitions 1.2.0" and "Durandal Router 1.2.0". I organized the folders and quit the "views" and "viewmodels" from folder "App" of Durandal and put the new views in folder "VIews" of mvc4 area for example: Areas-->NewArea-->Views-->ControllerFolder-->views-->shell.html Then I put the '"viewmodels" in "Script" folder for example: Scripts-->NewArea-->ControllerFolder-->viewmodels-->shell.js Scripts-->NewArea-->ControllerFolder-->main.js Then I changed paths for JS of durandal, for example in main.js: define(['../../../App/durandal/app',
    '../../../App/durandal/viewLocator',
    '../../../App/durandal/system',
    '../../../App/durandal/plugins/router',
    '../../../App/services/logger'],
 And I changed main.js in the next line: viewLocator.useConvention('viewmodels', '../Areas/NewArea/Views/ControllerFolder/views');
 But that configuration of folders fails because the next line calls various times the module "viewLocator" in its definition and rewrite the configuration of "useConvention" with default value: app.setRoot('viewmodels/shell', 'entrance');
 That behavior only happen when the folders "views" and "viewmodels" don't stay under "App" folder of "Durandal". Please help me, how to have various SPAs in the same project?

@TITLE:Ember Data and mapping JSON objects
@CONTENT:I have truly searched and I have not found a decent example of using the serializer to get objects from a differently formatted JSON response. My reason for not changing the format of the JSON response is outlined here http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/security/#json-security. I'm not very good with javascript yet so I had a hard time understanding the hooks in the serialize_json.js or maybe I should be using mapping (I just don't know). So here is an example of my JSON response for many objects: {
  "total_pages": 1, 
  "objects": [
     {
      "is_completed": true, 
      "id": 1, 
      "title": "I need to eat"
    }, 
    {
      "is_completed": false, 
      "id": 2, 
      "title": "Hey does this work"
    }, 
    {
      "is_completed": false, 
      "id": 3, 
      "title": "Go to sleep"
    }, 
  ], 
  "num_results": 3, 
  "page": 1
}

    adapter: DS.RESTAdapter.create({

 My question is how do I deal with total_pages, num_results and page? And by deal, I mean ignore so I can just map the objects array.

   Person p = personList.get(i); //java.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.LinkedHashMap cannot be cast to Person

@TITLE:How to detect loss of internet reachability when wifi source loses connection?
@CONTENT:I am trying hard to get the authentic internet connectivity status. I have used Apple's Reachability but it's only giving me the status of wifi connectivity i.e. not covering the case when the device is connected via wifi (to a router or hotspot), but the wifi router or hotspot itself is not connected to the internet. This scenario is reproducible by pulling the internet input cable from wifi router. The reachability's notifier returns ReachableViaWiFi for both reachabilityForInternetConnection and ReachabilityWithHostName. I am quite much in a fix with this issue. I tried it via the NSURLConnection too but that's draining battery too much and personally I don't like that solution to keep making URL requests, though in a background thread. Here's the code that I am using (courtesy of an SO fellow, don't remember the exact link though)  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(checkNetworkStatus:) name:kReachabilityChangedNotification object:nil];

    internetReachable = [[Reachability reachabilityForInternetConnection] retain];

    // check if a pathway to a random host exists
    hostReachable = [[Reachability reachabilityWithHostName: @"www.google.com"] retain];
    [hostReachable startNotifier];
 then in the observer method:  - (void) checkNetworkStatus:(NSNotification *)notice{

    // called after network status changes

    NetworkStatus internetStatus = [internetReachable currentReachabilityStatus];
    switch (internetStatus)

    {

@LINK:/questions/15069151/secure-way-to-communicate-oauth-token-to-javascript-client
@TITLE:Secure way to communicate OAuth token to javascript client
@CONTENT:I am designing a multi-platform application at the moment (clients would include internally developed mobile apps, and an AJAX heavy javascript client initially) centred around a REST API. Since in the future the API may be open to third parties, I am looking at using OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization with the API. I am trying to get my head around some of the security issues with this arrangement, particularly with regard to the javascript client. I don't want this client to behave like a third party client might, with a whole bunch of redirects and popups and stuff, which is what most OAuth documentation seems to focus on. Since it will be delivered from my own domain, I am thinking that the server side of the webapp can be the actual client, and store the client secrets and refresh tokens, while the javascript retrieves new auth tokens from the server as it needs them. To put it in step by step form: The user logs in using non-ajax html form, generating auth and refresh tokens which are stored server side. This sets a HTTP-only login session cookie. The javascript client code is sent to the user's browser after login. The javascript client makes a request to a resource that is part of its own application (not part of REST api) to retrieve the token. The session cookie ensures that the client is genuine, and the referer will also be checked. Auth token is returned. The javascript client validates the token with the REST API. The client can now use the token to make requests against the REST API until it expires. If the auth token expires or the page is closed and re-opened, the javascript client can request a new token. The server side of the webapp takes care of refreshing the token and sends the new token, as long as the login session cookie is still valid. Does this make sense, or would it leave massive holes in the system? In particular, is it insane to have a resource on the web that hands out authentication tokens based on a cookie being set?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a navigation menu that contains multiple level of organization. I'm building a nested jQuery UI Accordion that works great if all my content in the lowest level (deepest) nest of the accordion. The problem is that some elements will have content and a sub accordion. If I place some text in side the top accordion it looks great...but as soon as I wrap it in tags it breaks the nested accordion in that element Here is a mockup of what I'm trying to get it to look like Photo Mockup My current HTML     <div id="faqs-container" class="accordian">
    <h3><a href="#">One</a></h3>

   <div class="accordian">

</div>
 Jquery  $("div.accordian").accordion({
        autoHeight: false,
        collapsible: true,
        active: false

    });
 Running the code like this generates a good nested accordion for the first section but the second section renders incorrectly. It looks like jQuery starts grabbing the fist html element after the header to build the accordion. I have specified the header option when calling accordian as follows $("div.accordian").accordion({
    autoHeight: false,
    collapsible: true,
    active: false,
    header: 'h3'

});
 This gets close to the desired effect. The list renders in the correct place but the nested accordion in the second section is non functional. I have a Fiddle set up

@TITLE:How to diagnose these PHP-Code-Coverage segmentation and zend_mm_heap corrupted errors
@CONTENT:I have been happily coding away on my Ubuntu machine. It's a beefy machine with plenty of RAM. I was working on 4 new classes, writing and running unit tests as I go. At some point I noticed that, while the unit tests were completing fine, code coverage was not. After the message "Generating code coverage report...etc.." I would get a message saying zend_mm_heap corrupted. I tried a few fixes including: setting output_buffering = On in my php.ini (both apache2 and cli), and removing calls to unset() from my code. (I read on SO these fixed might be required). Now, I seem to alternate between the zend_mm... error, and a Segmentation fault (core dump) error, no matter what I do. I comment out tests until I narrow down the one that I think causes the problem, and make some changes there until I get a clean run. Then I'll uncomment all the test only to find the that fault still occurs. Any ideas? What tools or method could I use to gather more info? I am using PHP_CodeCoverage 1.2.6, PHP 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.5, PHPUnit 3.7.9. EDIT: As an aside, I can't find any core dump files. Have searched from the root of both my physical disks with no luck. I have read the man entry on core, including the possible reasons for core dumps not creating a file, but I don't think any of those apply.

@CONTENT:Could someone tell me where I'm doing wrong? These are the steps that I have followed: Downloaded the adt-bundle-windows from android developer website Created a new project and a libs/armeabi folder Extract all the *.so files from javacv-android-arm.jar, opencv-2.4.3-android-arm.zip, and ffmpeg-1.0-android-arm.zip directly into the newly created "libs/armeabi" folder, without creating any new subdirectories. (A part that I don't understand is "Extract all the *.so files from javacv-android-arm.jar", I simply inserted the javacv-android-arm.jar file inside libs/armeabi folder) Navigated to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries and click "Add JARs...". Selected both javacpp.jar and javacv.jar from the newly created "libs" folder. After that I have downloaded OpenCV2.4.3 from here and ffmpeg from here and extracted the files on my C:/ root. Finally after setting my system path..., C:\opencv\build\x64\vc10\bin;C:\ffmpeg-64\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10\bin

Function is the one of the build-in objects in javascript. the 3 format creation function object are equal. var function_name = new Function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN, function_body)
function function_name(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
{
...
}
var function_name=function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
{
...
}
 So, that is why create a prototype chain we have to create a function and then call it with the new keyword . Function.prototype is the reference to All the Function object prototype. Cheers
@CODE:prototype var config = {
  writable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: true
};

var defineProperty = function(obj, name, value) {
  config.value = value;
  Object.defineProperty(obj, name, config);
}


var man= Object.create(null);
defineProperty(man, 'sex', "male");

var person = Object.create(man);
person.greet = function (person) {
    return this.name + ': Why, hello there, ' + person + '.'
}
var p=Object.getPrototypeOf(person);
alert(p.sex);//shows male
person.prototype.age=13;//why there is a error said the prototype is undefined? I thought it supposed be man object...

var child=function(){}
child.prototype.color="red";//why this line doesn't show error? both child and person are an object . 

alert(child.prototype.color);//shows red

var ch=Object.getPrototypeOf(child);

alert(ch.color);//why it is undefined? it is supposed red. Function var function_name = new Function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN, function_body)
function function_name(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
{
...
}
var function_name=function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
{
...

@TITLE:Calculate clipspace.w from clipspace.xyz and (inv) projection matrix
@CONTENT:I'm using a logarithmic depth algorithmic which results in someFunc(clipspace.z) being written to the depth buffer and no implicit perspective divide. I'm doing RTT / postprocessing so later on in a fragment shader I want to recompute eyespace.xyz, given ndc.xy (from the fragment coordinates) and clipspace.z (from someFuncInv() on the value stored in the depth buffer). Note that I do not have clipspace.w, and my stored value is not clipspace.z / clipspace.w (as it would be when using fixed function depth) - so something along the lines of ... float clip_z = ...; /* [-1 .. +1] */
vec2 ndc = vec2(FragCoord.xy / viewport * 2.0 - 1.0);
vec4 clipspace = InvProjMatrix * vec4(ndc, clip_z, 1.0));
clipspace /= clipspace.w;
 ... does not work here. So is there a way to calculate clipspace.w out of clipspace.xyz, given the projection matrix or it's inverse?
@CODE:float clip_z = ...; /* [-1 .. +1] */
vec2 ndc = vec2(FragCoord.xy / viewport * 2.0 - 1.0);
vec4 clipspace = InvProjMatrix * vec4(ndc, clip_z, 1.0));
clipspace /= clipspace.w;

@TITLE:Detect Anomaly Intervals with SQL
@CONTENT:My problem is simple: I have a table with a series of statuses and timestamps (for the sake of curiosity, these statuses indicate alarm levels) and I would like to query this table in order to get duration between two statuses. Seems simple, but here comes the tricky part: I can?t create look-up tables, procedures and it should be as fast as possible as this table is a little monster holding over 1 billion records (no kidding!)... The schema is drop dead simple: [pk] Time Value (actualy, there is a second pk but it is useless for this) And below a real world example: 
Timestamp          Status
2013-1-1 00:00:00    1
2013-1-1 00:00:05    2
2013-1-1 00:00:10    2
2013-1-1 00:00:15    2
2013-1-1 00:00:20    0
2013-1-1 00:00:25    1
2013-1-1 00:00:30    2
2013-1-1 00:00:35    2
2013-1-1 00:00:40    0
 The output, considering only a level 2 alarm, should be as follow should report the begin of a level 2 alarm an its end (when reach 0): 
StartTime          EndTime            Interval
2013-1-1 00:00:05  2013-1-1 00:00:20     15
2013-1-1 00:00:30  2013-1-1 00:00:40     10

@CONTENT:I'm working on a program (python ,opencv) in which I use the spacebar to go to the next frame, and Esc to exit the program. These are the only two keys i've got working. I tried to find out about more keys , tried various codes for them but didnt work. especially arrow keys. I found this about waitkey, but it doesn't work. So my question is, How do I catch other keys besides esc and spacebar to trigger certain functions in my python-opencv program?

@TITLE:How does reveal.js resize elements?
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand how reveal.js ( http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/ ) resizes elements dynamically. To see this, adjust the height of the page and see how elements (to a certain degree) shrink as the page shrinks. However, using chrome inspector, I cannot see how this shrinking is actually happening, either in CSS or Javascript. (My interest comes from wanting to improve it, if possible, but I was surprised how hard it was to figure out how it works at all.)

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Sort element by numerical value of data attribute I want to reorganize divs according to a data attribute set on them, ranging from highest integer to lowest. Right now, I push all the data into an array and sort that but I'm not sure how to proceed. How can I use this to reorganize divs inside their parent div? var prices = new Array();
$(this).children('.listing-item').each(function() {

 This gets me an array like 139,129,129,109,109,84 for example. Now my idea was to loop through the divs another time with a selector like this: $('.listing-item[data-listing-price="' + prices[0] + '"]')
 but I'm not sure how to move the divs (the div with the highest data-attribute integer should move to the top and so on. Any idea?

 In the updateUi() method i want to show/inflate another UI. How to do ? Is there a way to "restart" the Fragment and then inflate another Fragment-Layout in the onCreateView().

@TITLE:PostgreSQL equivalent of Oracle's PERCENTILE_CONT function
@CONTENT:Has anyone found a PostgreSQL equivalent of Oracle's PERCENTILE_CONT function? I searched, and could not find one, so I wrote my own. Here is the solution that I hope helps you out. The company I work for wanted to migrate a Java EE web application from using an Oracle database over to using PostgreSQL. Several stored procedures relied heavily upon using Oracle's unique PERCENTILE_CONT() function. This function does not exist in PostgreSQL. I tried searching to see if anyone had "ported over" that function into PG to no avail.

@LINK:/questions/14267836/serializing-groovy-map-to-string-with-quotes
@TITLE:Serializing groovy map to string with quotes
@CONTENT:I'm trying to persist a groovy map to a file. My current attempt is to write the string representation out and then read it back in and call evaluate on it to recreate the map when I'm ready to use it again. The problem I'm having is that the toString() method of the map removes vital quotes from the values of the elements. When my code calls evaluate, it complains about an unknown identifier. This code demonstrates the problem: m = [a: 123, b: 'test']
print "orig: $m\n"

s = m.toString()
print " str: $s\n"

m2 = evaluate(s)
print " new: ${m2}\n"
 The first two print statements almost work -- but the quotes around the value for the key b are gone. Instead of showing [a: 123, b: 'test'], it shows [a: 123, b: test]. At this point the damage is done. The evaluate call chokes when it tries to evaluate test as an identifier and not a string. So, my specific questions: Is there a better way to serialize/de-serialize maps in Groovy? Is there a way to produce a string representation of a map with proper quotes?
@CODE:evaluate toString() m = [a: 123, b: 'test']
print "orig: $m\n"

s = m.toString()
print " str: $s\n"

m2 = evaluate(s)

@TITLE:How to correctly configure a reverse proxy with Apache, to be used for cross-domain AJAX?
@CONTENT:Needing to develop a web application that at the same time is highly dependent on an API but at the same time cannot reside on the same domain as the API itself, it's been quite tricky getting around the "Same Origin Policy" when making asynchronous HTTP requests (AJAX). At one point, I was recommended to install WAMP on my computer (running Windows 7) and to configure a reverse proxy with Apache. The same person gave me the Apache directives bellow that I added to the httpd.conf file, after telling me to create an alias for the IP 127.0.0.1 named dev , within the file at c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts (which I did): LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_connect_module modules/mod_proxy_connect.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so

Listen 127.0.0.1:8080
ProxyRequests off

<Proxy *>
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from 127.0.0.1
</Proxy>

                SSLProxyEngine on
    SSLProxyVerify none
</VirtualHost>
 Since I'm a complete novice when it comes to configuring servers, I simply pasted the directives and fortunately enough, the proxy worked. It returns the correct response from the API when I use the browser's address bar to access, for example, http://dev:8080/a/w/currencies. Unfortunately though, an AJAX request to the same URL (code bellow) makes Chrome give me the XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://dev:8080/a/w/currencies. Origin http://dev is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. error. $.ajax({
    url: "http://dev:8080/a/w/currencies",
    type: "GET",
    dataType: "json",
    data: {

    },
    success: function(data){
        console.log(data);
    }
}); 
 So what must still be done in order for this proxy to work with AJAX? I've been told something about an alias directive, but not specific and clear enough, so it didn't make much sense to my inexperienced brain. PS: Also, I've been told "the problem is that you're getting the files from dev:80 and ajaxing to dev:8080". Given my inexperience, neither this makes much sense.

So far so good, but... sometimes i get errors like these: "Script error.","Error loading script","Unexpected token <" My assumption is that the Google CDN is blocked in these cases (for whatever reason). I do have a local fallback for jQuery, that I'm fairly sure is working well, but I would like to find out what's being returned so that I can test my assumptions and maybe get some of these users on a white list for Google CDN (if it's company firewall blocking it). But so far I haven't been able to figure out how to retrieve the returned content. Can't retrieve innerText of a SCRIPT tag if it's a file, can't do an ajax request because of cross-domain policy, etc. Does anyone have any ideas about how this would be possible?

@TITLE:Query optimization and API throttling
@CONTENT:We are tracking Facebook Page and Post metrics for a number of clients, and we have some questions regarding high CPU intensity and too many calls for Post/comments - according to what is being reported by the developer insights console (Insights -> Developer -> Activity & Errors). The documentation is somewhat unclear on the limits and restrictions for the Graph API, and we'd simply like to make sure we have the correct understanding of what resources we have available. We are working on optimizing our software and queries to decrease the error rate and number of requests. Related to this work we have a few questions: We have changed to use FQL queries instead of regular Graph API requests for fetching Post comments, which enables us to fetch comments for several posts per request. This have lead to a significant decrease in number of requests. We use a query with page_id IN (PAGE_ID_1, PAGE_ID_2, ....). Will this increase the CPU intensity compared with a regular Graph API request? We have also implemented throttling of requests on our end to make sure we distribute our requests evenly over time and not in big bursts. For Page comments, we make sure the maximum number of request do not exceed 300 over a 10 minute period. In other words, we are limiting the number of Page comment requests to 0.5 per second or 30 per minute. Is this still to high? Once request limits are exceeded, we assume this is for an access token, not APP ID? So if one of our clients has been over-using resources, our APP will still continue working on behalf of our other clients which have different access tokens? In the developer console, under the Insights -> Developer -> Activity & Errors page for our app, the API Throttling table have a time above it. As an example 1 hour, 14 minutes. What does this time indicate, how often is this table updated, and how old are the numbers? We are getting a small amount of errors with response code 500. Are these errors typically a result of exceeding request and/or CPU limits? If not, are there any ways to determine what is actually causing them, and if there is something we can do on our end to fix it? We'd appreciate any input on and confirmation of our assumptions.

 Some of the code is incomplete / not used as I'm trying a lot of different methods. What's Working: For code like the following: function run() {
   console.log(123);
}
 Works perfectly. But any asynchronous code fails to update. Problem = Asynchronous Code app.get('/', function(req, res){
   // code here..
});
 If I then update the file when the nodejs process is running, nothing happens, though it goes through the file watcher and the cache is deleted, then re-established. Another instance where it doesn't work is: // middleware.js
function hello(req, res, next) {
  // code here...
}

// another file:
app.use(hello);
 As app.use would still be using the old version of that method. Question: How could I fix the problem? Is there something I'm missing? Please don't throw suggestions to use 3rd party modules like forever. I'm trying to incorporate the functionality within the single instance. EDIT: After studying meteors codebase (there's surprisingly little resources on "Hot Code Push" in node.js or browser.) and tinkering around with my own implementation I've successfully made a working solution. https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/Refresh.js . This is still at an early stage of development, but it seems solid right now. I'll be implementing a browser solution too, just for sake of completion.

@CONTENT:How to get the Combobox selected item text which is inside a DataGridView? I have tried using the below code: dataGridView1.Rows[1].Cells[1].Value.ToString()
 But, this gives the value associated with this cell, not the Combobox selected item text. I also tried this: DataGridViewComboBoxCell cell = dataGridView1[1,1] as DataGridViewComboBoxCell;
string value = cell.Value.ToString();
 But, this also didn't help. I would appreciate your help. Thanks in advance! EDIT: Let's say, we have a Combobox with text as No and Yes and the values as 0 and 1 respectively. What I want to get here's the text Yes or No, when the Combobox is changed. But what I am getting is the values 0/1 using the above codes. Hope that makes things clear. UPDATE: Ok, so I have been working on this issue and after lots of efforts and with help from my fellow members, I have been able to resolve the issue and get the required solution: Here's the solution: string SelectedText = Convert.ToString(dataGridView1.Rows[0].Cells[1].FormattedValue.ToString());

@TITLE:How do I make a class, which I can't change, implement an interface?
@CONTENT:I have a class from another library that is closed-source, but I want to be able to use an interface for it. The reason being that I don't want to do instanceof checks or null-checks everywhere, but I also don't want to extend the existing class. For example, let's say I have this code: public class Example {

    // QuietFoo is from another library that I can't change
    private static QuietFoo quietFoo;
    // LoudFoo is my own code and is meant to replace QuietFoo
    private static LoudFoo loudFoo;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        handle(foo);
    }

    private static void handle(Object foo) {
        if (foo instanceof QuietFoo)
            ((QuietFoo) foo).bar();
        else if (foo instanceof LoudFoo)
            ((LoudFoo) foo).bar();
    }
}
 I can't change QuietFoo: public class QuietFoo {

    public void bar() {
        System.out.println("bar");
    }
}
 But I can change LoudFoo: public class LoudFoo {

    public void bar() {
        System.out.println("BAR!!");
    }
}
 The problem is, there may be many other implementations of bar in many classes, and there may be more methods than just bar, so not only would my handle method get slow and ugly with lots of instanceof statements, but I would have to write one of these handle methods for each method on QuietFoo and LoudFoo. Extending isn't a viable solution because it violates the whole is-a contract since LoudFoo is not a QuietFoo. Basically, given Foo: public interface Foo {
    void bar();
}
 How can I make QuietFoo implement Foo without changing its source so I don't have to do casting and instanceof calls everywhere in my code?
@CODE:instanceof null public class Example {

    // QuietFoo is from another library that I can't change
    private static QuietFoo quietFoo;
    // LoudFoo is my own code and is meant to replace QuietFoo
    private static LoudFoo loudFoo;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        handle(foo);
    }

    private static void handle(Object foo) {
        if (foo instanceof QuietFoo)
            ((QuietFoo) foo).bar();
        else if (foo instanceof LoudFoo)
            ((LoudFoo) foo).bar();
    }
} QuietFoo public class QuietFoo {

    public void bar() {
        System.out.println("bar");
    }
} LoudFoo public class LoudFoo {

    public void bar() {
        System.out.println("BAR!!");
    }
} bar bar handle instanceof QuietFoo LoudFoo LoudFoo QuietFoo Foo public interface Foo {
    void bar();
} QuietFoo Foo instanceof

@TITLE:Where is Magento order data stored?
@CONTENT:I am running Magento 1.6.2 and have an intermittent error cropping up with some sales orders. The customer is being charged correctly, but the Magento admin page when viewing the sale reports incorrect values. I understand why it is doing it incorrectly - I have a 10% discount off a full section of products on my website, and it is because of this that something is going wrong. Again, the customer is paying the correct (discounted) amount, but the data must be being stored incorrectly in the magento database because looking at it in the admin system doesn't total the values correctly. The Catalog Price Rule that applies the 10% discount is not accounted for in the displayed totals. To add to my woes, we use Zynk to bring data in from Magento to our Sage 200 backoffice system, and the data getting imported into that system is also missing the 10% discount, making reconciliation of order payments and Sage invoices a complete pain. The only thing I can think is that somewhere somehow the data is being stored in the magento database incorrectly (not having had the 10% discount applied to it) so when Zynk collects the data, it is incorrect. Can anyone help me understand where I can find the order data in the Magento database so I can see what was stored for a specific Magento order number - I can at least begin to debug this then, maybe? If someone has details of where to find the code used by Magento to perform the order database transactions, specifically where the discounts should be applied before storing the data, that would be a big help too.

@CONTENT:My problem seems very common, but I haven't found any answer in the documentation or the internet itself. It might seem a clone of this question has_many while respecting build strategy in factory_girl but 2,5 years after that post factory_girl changed a lot. I have a model with a has_many relation called photos. I want to populate this has many relation preserving my choice of build strategy. If I call offering = FactoryGirl.build_stubbed :offering, :stay I expect offering.photos to be a collection of stubbed models. The only way i've found to achieve this is this one: factory :offering do
  association :partner, factory: :named_partner
  association :destination, factory: :geolocated_destination

  trait :stay do
    title "Hotel Gran V?a"
    description "Great hotel in a great zone with great views"

      when FactoryGirl::Strategy::Stub then [FactoryGirl.build_stubbed(:hotel_photo)]

@TITLE:Restarting erlang process and preserving state
@CONTENT:I have a supervisor process which starts number of child processes. Currently when the child dies I spawn a new process with new Pid. This means I loose the state information of my child process which has just died. I want my clients to communicate with child processes using always the same identifier. Despite the fact that child process may die and be restarted by the supervisor. I was thinking of registering child processes with unique names and storing child state in ets table. The question is - what is the recommended way of approaching such problem in Erlang? Thanks!

@TITLE:Rendering infinitely large plane
@CONTENT:I want to render a plane so that it looks as if it goes to infinity in all directions. I want the plane boundary in the distance to be the horizon. Using a simple mesh does not work - the computer can't render infinitely many triangles. Even if this was possible, the camera frustum would cut out the distant polygons and create a gap between the plane boundary and the horizon. A workaround is to compute the horizon mathematically: finding points on the plane, which also lie on the plane at infinity. Connecting these points and two corners of the viewport creates a trapezoid which represents the sought plane. However, this way the plane can not be lit properly, or applied a texture, or anything else which requires a fine triangulation...

@LINK:/questions/12957605/ios-crash-log-backtrace-not-available
@TITLE:iOS crash log, backtrace not available
@CONTENT:Summary Since the last update of our app was released, many users started complaining about the app not starting anymore. We received a crash log and console log from 2 different users, as well as a video from the crash. Our app does not crash on every device, but when it does it crashes every single time within a second of tapping the icon (the video shows this as well as the phone of a friend). The crash log is very weird, for it does not contain a backtrace and the frame pointer (R7) is 0x00000000. We didn't change much for this update and nothing we changed could corrupt the stack like this. Furthermore, reinstalling the app fixes the issue. This leads us to believe the error is not in our code, but in the binary which might have become corrupted somewhere. Details According to some users our app crashes on startup since the last update. We are unable to reproduce this issue but received crash logs from one the users. The log comes from the harddrive of the user (~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/). I've seen the same thing directly from the phone of a friend who experiences the same issue. This crash appears to occur as soon as our app receives control from iOS (see update). However, the crash logs contains no backtrace and states an error occurred on an unknown thread. I tried symbolicating the log, but obviously there is nothing to symbolicate. It appears to be some kind of nullpointer error, but why no backtrace? What could cause this type of error and what can I do to reproduce/solve it?

 Update A video sent to me by the same user indicates the app crashes even before the intro animation starts. So before the app is actually running (or one of the first lines of code our app runs). In ARMv6/7 architecture, the R7 register holds the frame pointer. It should point to the previous stack frame, but is 0x00000000 in our case. A lot of registers are null actually. What could possibly cause this? Also, the crashing is very consistent; it crashes every time within a second of tapping the icon. At least for this particular user. We've had more, but less specific, reports of the app "not starting". Re-installing the app fixes any problem the user had. The console log doesn't show much either, just this: It's starting to sound very much like updating through the App Store corrupts the binary, but only on updating: http://www.pcworld.com/article/258827/updated_apps_crashing_heres_what_you_need_to_know.html http://www.marco.org/2012/07/04/app-store-corrupt-binaries I've sent a request to Apple's technical service to help out on this. I'll report back here. Apple Technical Service update I've posted a bug report, they requested a console log of the time of crash. I've supplied them one, which to my understanding doesn't contain much of use. Except: 2012-10-23 09:14:18 +0000 backboardd Application 'UIKitApplication:com.company.myapp[0xdd31]' exited abnormally with signal 11: Segmentation fault: 11
 The technical department doesn't know what to do about this issue either, but advised us NOT to upload a new binary without any code changes. There is no way to test if the issues goes away (wtf) and if it doesn't work it will upset users even more. Still waiting for the answer to my bug report...

 What puzzles me is that the connectionRepositoryinstantiation works perfectly fine (I commented-out the twitter bean and tested the code!) ?!? It uses the same features: request scope and interface AOP proxy and works, but the twitter bean instantiation fails ?!?

public class SocialConfig {

    @Inject
    private Environment environment;

    @Inject

        return registry;
    }

    }

        }
        return usersConnectionRepository().createConnectionRepository(authentication.getName());
    }

        return twitter != null ? twitter.getApi() : new TwitterTemplate();
    }

 I stopped the service and ran Jenkins from command line and tried the same thing - with the same result. I am able to connect to the svn server with a tortoise client and via firefox with the same credentials. In researching the issue I saw a few posts about similar problems and the only one that seems to claim to fix it is rolling back to Jenkins svn plugin version. I then tried to install the latest jenkins and Plugin for svn. The downloads failed. Aha, I thought - obviously a firewall issue. So I disable the firewall. Still no good. I can't automatically download or get the new Jenkins or SVN plugin.

@TITLE:Splitting irregular time series into regular monthly averages - R
@CONTENT:In order to establish seasonal effects on energy use, I need to align the energy use information that I have from a billing database with monthly temperatures. I'm working with a billing dataset that has bills of varying lengths and start and end dates, and I'd like to obtain the monthly average for each account within each month. For example, I have a billing database that has the following characteristics:    acct amount      begin        end days
1  2242  11349 2009-10-06 2009-11-04   29

 I would like to figure out how to coerce these somewhat irregular time series (for each account) to get the average amount per day within each month that is spanned within each bill, such that:    acct amount      begin        end days avgamtpday

 I'm fairly agnostic to whichever tool can do this, since I only have to do this once. An additional wrinkle is the table is about 150,000 rows long, which is not really very big by most standards, but big enough to make a loop solution in R difficult. I've investigated using the zoo, xts, and tempdisagg packages in R. I started writing a really ugly loop that would split each bill, then create one row for each month within an existing bill, and then tapply() to summarize by accts and months, but honestly, couldn't see how to do it efficiently. In MySQL, I've tried this: create or replace view v3 as select 1 n union all select 1 union all select 1; create or replace view v as select 1 n from v3 a, v3 b union all select 1; set @n = 0; drop table if exists calendar; create table calendar(dt date primary key); insert into calendar select cast('2008-1-1' + interval @n:=@n+1 day as date) as dt from v a, v b, v c, v d, v e, v; select acct, amount, begin, end, billAmtPerDay, sum(billAmtPerDay), MonthAmt, count() Days, sum(billAmtPerDay)/count() AverageAmtPerDay, year(dt), month(dt) FROM ( select *, amount/days billAmtPerDay from bills b inner join calendar c on dt between begin and end and begin <> dt) x group by acct, amount, begin, end, billAmtPerDay, year(dt), month(dt); But for reasons I don't understand, my server doesn't like this table, and gets hung up on the inner join, even when I stage the different calculations. I'm investigating if there are any temporary memory limits on it. Thanks!

2) umbraco.cms.businesslogic.web.Document
3) umbraco.MacroEngines.DynamicNode
4) umbraco.presentation.nodeFactory.Node
 Are there any others? Can you explain what they do, and when to use them? umbraco.MacroEngines.DynamicNode and umbraco.presentation.nodeFactory.Node seem the same. Perhaps it is better to use Node class because it is faster? I have a theory: umbraco.cms.businesslogic.Content and umbraco.cms.businesslogic.web.Document are the representation of cmsContent and cmsDocument DB tables. umbraco.presentation.nodeFactory.Node and umbraco.MacroEngines.DynamicNode represents the node cached in XML file, to utilize into website. The first is the simply Node, the second is the same Node with added dynamic properties, one for property defined in nodeType. So, I think that Node is faster than DynamicNode Is there someone that can confirm this?

@TITLE:Bind button in DataTemplate to command in the form's ViewModel
@CONTENT:My problem is similar to the one described in this question: WPF MVVM Button Control Binding in DataTemplate Here is my XAML: <Window x:Class="MissileSharp.Launcher.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"

        <ListBox ItemsSource="{Binding CommandSets}">
            <ListBox.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
                    <!-- I need the button here (inside the list), and here the binding does NOT work -->
                    <Button Content="{Binding}" Command="{Binding Path=FireCommand}" />
                </DataTemplate>
            </ListBox.ItemTemplate>
        </ListBox>
    </Grid>
</Window>
 It's just a ListBox, bound to an ObservableCollection<string> named CommandSets (which is in the ViewModel). This binding works (it displays a button for each item in the collection). Now I want to bind the button to a command (FireCommand), which is also in the ViewModel. Here's the relevant part of the ViewModel: public class MainWindowViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public ICommand FireCommand { get; set; }
    public ObservableCollection<string> CommandSets { get; set; }

    public MainWindowViewModel()
    {
        this.FireCommand = new RelayCommand(new Action<object>(this.FireMissile));
    }

    private void FireMissile(Object obj)
    {
        System.Windows.MessageBox.Show("fire");
    }

 The binding of this button does NOT work. From what I've understood from the question I linked above, the binding doesn't work because: (correct me if I'm wrong) The button is inside the ListBox, so it only "knows" the binding of the ListBox (the ObservableCollection, in this case), but not the binding of the main window I'm trying to bind to a command in the main ViewModel of the main window (which the button doesn't "know") The command itself is definitely correct, because when I put the button outside the ListBox (see the XAML above for an example), the binding works and the command is executed. Apparently, I "just" need to tell the button to bind to the main ViewModel of the form. But I'm not able to figure out the right XAML syntax. I tried several approaches that I found after some googling, but none of them worked for me: <Button Content="{Binding}" Command="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Window}, Path=DataContext.FireCommand}" />

<Button Content="{Binding}" Command="{Binding Path=FireCommand, Source={StaticResource MainWindow}}" />

<Button Content="{Binding}" Command="{Binding Path=FireCommand, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type Window}}}" />
 Could someone please: give me the proper XAML to bind the button inside the ListBox to a command in the form's MainViewModel? point me to a link where this advanced binding stuff is explained in a way that a WPF/MVVM beginner can understand? I'm feeling like I'm just copying and pasting arcane XAML incantations, and so far I don't have any clue (and can't find any good documentation) how I would figure out by myself in which cases I'd need RelativeSource or StaticResource or whatever instead of a "normal" binding.

@TITLE:Weak and strong properties in -viewDidUnload under ARC
@CONTENT:I am new to iphone development . I am using ARC for my project. As far as I understood using ARC we don't have to release any object manually. But , I have observed in some places , people explicitly set their object to nil in the ViewDidUnload even after using ARC. For example, in .h file I have something like this: @property (unsafe_unretained, nonatomic) IBOutlet MKMapView *mapViewOutlet;
@property (unsafe_unretained, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIToolbar *toolBar;
@property (strong,nonatomic) NSMutableArray *dataArray;
 And .m as follows: - (void)viewDidUnload
{
     [self setMapViewOutlet:nil];
     [self setToolBar:nil];
     [super viewDidUnload];
     self.dataArray=nil;
}
 My question is, is it really necessary to explicitly specify nil in the ViewDidUnload even under ARC?

@TITLE:Numpy multi-dimensional array indexing swaps axis order
@CONTENT:I am working with multi-dimensional Numpy arrays. I have noticed some inconsistent behavior when accessing these arrays with other index arrays. For example: import numpy as np
start = np.zeros((7,5,3))
a     = start[:,:,np.arange(2)]
b     = start[0,:,np.arange(2)]
c     = start[0,:,:2]
print 'a:', a.shape
print 'b:', b.shape
print 'c:', c.shape
 In this example, I get the result: a: (7, 5, 2)
b: (2, 5)
c: (5, 2)
 This confuses me. Why do "b" and "c" not have the same dimensions? Why does "b" swap the axis order, but not "a"? I have been able to design my code around these inconsistencies thanks to lots of unit tests, but understanding what is going on would be appreciated. For reference, I am using Python 2.7.3, and Numpy 1.6.2 via MacPorts.
@CODE:import numpy as np
start = np.zeros((7,5,3))

@CONTENT:When I open a Delphi 7 Project in Delphi XE2 and open the Project Option I get an error: "Unable to set Icon: Cannot open file "........\AppName_Icon.ico".
The system cannot find the file specified".
 I also notice that the Version info of the Project is missing. The Delphi 7 project has .Res file that has the MAINICON along with the version information stored. Why is Delphi XE2 not able to use this .Res file to retrive the MAINICON & Version information. Also if I try to compile the application in XE2 I get an error - [BRCC32 Error] MtxReq.vrc(2): file not found: MtxReq_Icon.ico
 The MTXReq.vrc file (a new file) is created and the MtxReq.res file is deleted. Why is this happening? I don't want to loose my project icon and version settings from .res file. Is there a way to force XE2 to use the .res file and not delete it? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Sorry I can't post a comment yet (need more repotation points) ... Warren - here the reponse to your question (Wouldn't just deleting your .dproj file and keeping the .dpr only, have been faster?) I deleted the .dproj, .dproj.local Opened the .dpr in XE2 and it recreated the .dproj file. It brough back the icon from the .res but I lost project version info. Only File Version and Product Version info got migrated but lost all other versioning info. (This is because of the default manifest file). I then tried what I explained in Step 1 of my solution. I open the .dproj file in notepad deleted the tag entries under and reopened the .dproj file and all my version info now was recovered. The problem here is the $(BDS)\bin\default_app.manifest. Also I noticed that Version info is stored in tag under the tag in the .dproj file and once you delete the default manifest entries, the IDE pickups the version key information correctly from the . So basically by deleting the .dpr file I skipped the step of extracting and adding the .ico file to the project, but had to edit the newly created .proj file and delete the entries for default manifest to retrieve the version info. (another solution would have been to manully add the version info and saving the project. I did not try this)

@CONTENT:I have the following Model: window.MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
     initialize: function(props){
          this.url = props.url;
     } 

     parse: function(){

          // @override- parsing data fetched from URL
     }


});

 // instantiate
  var mod = new MyModel({url: 'some/url/here'});
 I use this global variable 'mod' to fetch some data into this model from backend.  // fetch

 mod.fetch({
       success: function(){ ...},
       error: ...

 });
 All above works well.... My Issue: I want to reuse this model by changing resetting the url and call fetch but it does not update the url somehow. I have tried the following:   mod.fetch({ 
       data: {url:'/some/other/url'},
       postData: true,
       success: function(){ //process data},
       error: ...
  });


 mod.set({url: '/some/other/url'});
 // called fetch() without data: and postData: attributes as mentioned in previous
 How do I set the url for my model so that I could call fetch() and it fetches data from updated url? Am I missing something. Thanks for any pointers.. UPDATE 1: Basically, I am unable to get updated values if I did     model.set({url: 'new value'}); 
 followed by     model.fetch();
 'model' is a global variable. Creating a fresh instance of 'model' works:     model = new Model({url:'/some/other/url'}); 
    model.fetch();
 however, works as required. Does this mean that a model instance is permanently attached to a url and it cannot be reset? ANSWER TO MY QUESTION in UPDATE 1 Model instance is not permanently attached to a url. It can be reset dynamically. Please read through @tkone's thorough explanation and then @fguillens' solution for a better understanding.
@CODE:window.MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({

     parse: function(){

So far I'm not sure which of the above will fit and it looks like (as always) there are more then one way of doing what's to be done. The scenario is: 500GB - ~20 TB of documents stored in Hadoop. Text documents in multiple formats: email, doc, pdf, odt. Metadata about those documents stored in SQL db (sender, recipients, date, department etc.) Main source of documents will be ExchangeServer (emails and attachments), but not only. Now to the search: User needs to be able to do complex full-text searches over those documents. Basicaly he'll be presented with some search-config panel (java desktop application, not webapp) - he'll set date range, document types, senders/recipients, keywords etc. - fire the search and get the resulting list of the documents (and for each document info why its included in search results i.e. which keywords are found in document). Which tools I should take into consideration and which not? The point is to develop such solution with only minimal required "glue"-code. I'm proficient in SQLdbs but quite uncomfortable with Apache-and-related technologies. Basic workflow looks like this: ExchangeServer/other source -> conversion from doc/pdf/... -> deduplication -> Hadopp + SQL (metadata) -> build/update an index <- search through the docs (and do it fast) -> present search results Thank you!

 I need to get the pid of the process in the script so that i can use a ps -p <pid> inside. How do i get the pid of a process given its process name? I understand that there might be multiple processes in the same name. I just want to get the first process out of that list.

 I know how to parse it in Clojure (require '[clojure.xml :as xml])
(def x (xml/parse 'location/of/that/xml'))
 This returns a nested map describing the xml {:tag :data,

      :content [
          {:tag :product,

 This structure can of course be traversed with standard Clojure functions, but it may turn out to be really verbose, especially if compared to, for instance, querying it with XPath. Is there any helper to traverse and search such structure? How can I, for example get a list of all <product> get only the product whose <images> tag contains an <image> with text "img2.jpg" get the product whose section is "Red Section" Thanks

The intervals will range from milliseconds to weeks. Something like 0.2s 2:00 4 days ... I know I could manually check the size of the argument and then convert it but before reinventing the wheel I wanted to ask if there is a (standard) library to achieve that. TimeUnit does the conversions but there is no knowledge about the size of the argument a Joda-Time Duration represents exactly what I need but I did not find much about representation (but for the ISO8601 formatting of ReadableDuration) Edit: My input in in nanoseconds and output as described above.

@TITLE:Will this for-in loop detection snippet generate unwanted false positives?
@CONTENT:We all know that for-in-loops on arrays are absolutely evil. Still, they are often used and the caused errors are complicated to trace down, especially when happening browser-dependent for example because of indexOf-shims or such. So, I have coded this simple snippet which adds an enumerable getter for a "error" property on Array.prototype (not for use in production code): Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, "error", {
    enumerable: true,
    get: function() {
        if (this === Array.prototype) // that looks OK
            return undefined;
        if (window.confirm("Somebody who coded the site you're viewing runs through an Array with a for-in-loop.\nShame on him!\n\nDo you want to raise an Error to trace the origin?"))
            throw new SyntaxError("Array traverse with for-in-loop, touching Array.prototype's 'error' property :-)");
    }
});
 You can add it as a greasemonkey script for all domains, and you will see alerts on nearly every site :-) Most of them are caused by calls to jQuery.extend with questionable arguments, btw. My question is now: Are there any situations that legitimate such "wrong" loops, or anything else causing false-positive alerts? I am wondering how this would affect the usefulness of my code.

@TITLE:Telerik MVC Grid with Dynamic Columns at Run Time from a Collection or Dictionary
@CONTENT:After spending the last couple days searching, I'm officially stuck. I'm working on a binding an object to the Telerik MVC 3 Grid, but the catch is that it needs to have dynamically created columns (not auto generated). Three of the columns are known, the others are unknown, and this is the tricky part. Basically, it can be like these examples: KnownColumn1 | KnownColumn2 | UnknownColumn1 | KnownColumn3 KnownColumn1 | KnownColumn2 | UnknownColumn1 | UnknownColumn2 | UnknownColumn3 | KnownColumn3 etc. Because I'm putting the unknown columns in a list (I've tried a dictionary too so I can get the column names), this has complicated things for me when binding. My code is below: Model (There can be zero to hundreds of rows, but this model is in a view model of type List, there can also be 0 to 20 plus columns that are dynamically added) public class VendorPaymentsGLAccount
{
    public string GeneralLedgerAccountNumber { get; set; }
    public string GeneralLedgerAccountName { get; set; }
    public string DisplayName { get { return string.Format("{0} - {1}", GeneralLedgerAccountNumber, GeneralLedgerAccountName); } }
    public Dictionary<string, double> MonthAmount { get; set; }
    public double Total { get { return MonthAmount.Sum(x => x.Value); } }
    public List<string> Columns { get; set; }
    public List<double> Amounts { get; set; }

    public VendorPaymentsGLAccount() { }
}
 View (The section that's commented out was trying to use the dictionary) <fieldset>
    <legend>General Ledger Account Spend History</legend>
    @if (Model.VendorPaymentsGLAccounts != null)
    {

            <br />

                    {
                        columns.Bound(gl => gl.DisplayName).Title("General Ledger Account").Width(200).Filterable(false).Sortable(false);

                        //foreach (var month in Model.VendorPaymentsGLAccounts[0].MonthAmount)
                        //{
                        //    //columns.Bound(gl => gl.MonthAmount[month.Key.ToString()].ToString()).Title(month.Key.ToString()).Width(100).Filterable(false).Sortable(false);

 Using the dictionary approach, I was able to get the columns generated correctly with the right header text, but the values for the columns (in my testing there were only 2 columns) were the same. Can anyone help with this? This seems to be an oddball issue. Just trying to figure out how to do this correctly. Update: Here is a screen shot using the dictionary approach that shows the issue. The column headings are correct, but the values are the same for both of the dynamic columns.

    public string GeneralLedgerAccountNumber { get; set; }
    public string GeneralLedgerAccountName { get; set; }

@LINK:/questions/11433195/hibernate-orderby-vs-ordercolumn-to-maintain-the-order-of-a-collection
@TITLE:Hibernate: @OrderBy vs @OrderColumn to maintain the order of a collection
@CONTENT:What is the preferred way for maintaining the order of a collection while persisting and also while retrieving from database? I know that @OrderBy is more of a in-memory sorting that might work in retrieving only when you presist the rows in the order of column you chose. Let's say I chose to use a column backed by a database sequence, will hibernate make sure that elements in collection are persisted in the same order as in collection (say List). Any thought? More details: Let¡¦s say I have a class A which has one-to-many relationship with class B. B has a primary key field, ¡¥Id¡¦, which is backed by a sequence in DB. Class A {
  List<B> bList;
}
 I always wanted to retain the order of elements B in A like below: bList = { b1, b2, b3 }
 One way to achieve is using @OrderBy (¡§Id ASC¡¨). This would work only when the list B is persisted in the order as below: ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------

1------ b1
2------ b2
3-------b3
------------------
 When we retrieve since it is ordered by Id, the order is maintained. Let¡¦say the collection B is persisted in the following way: ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------
1------ b2
2------ b1
3-------b3
------------------
 When we retrieve, the order of list B go for a toss (since it is order by Id column). So my question, if the collection B always persist in the same order as it appears in the list or not.
@CODE:Class A {
  List<B> bList;
} bList = { b1, b2, b3 } ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------

1------ b1
2------ b2
3-------b3
------------------ ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------
1------ b2
2------ b1
3-------b3

        tast.Start();
    }


}

         Dictionary<string, string> aMassiveList = new Dictionary<string, string>();

         try
         {
             long i = 0;
             while (true)
             {
                 aMassiveList.Add(i.ToString(), "I am a line of text designed to waste space.... I am exceptionally useful........");
                 i++;

         {
             Console.WriteLine("I have broken myself");
         }
     }
}
 This is all as expected, although what we cannot currently work out is when this memory should be released from the CLR. We have let the task complete and then simulated a memory overload situation, but the memory consumed by the dictionary is not released. As the OS is running out of memory, is it not putting pressure on the CLR to release the memory? However and even more confusing, if we wait until the task has completed, then hit enter to run the task again the memory is released, so obviously the previous dictionary has been garbage collected (hasn't it?). So, why is the memory not being released? And how can we get the CLR to release the memory? Any explanations or solutions would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Following replies, particularly Beska's, it is obvious my description of the issue is not the the clearest, so I will try to clarify. The code may not be the best example, sorry! It was a quick crude piece of code to try to replicate the issue. The dictionary is used here to replicate the fact we have a large custom data object, which fills a large chunk of our memory and it is not then released after the task has completed. In the example, the dictionary fills up to the limit of the dictionary and then throws an exception, it does NOT keep filling forever! This is well before our memory is full, and it does not cause an OutOfMemoryException. Hence the result is a large object in memory, and then the task completes. At this point we would expect the dictionary to be out of scope, as both the task and the method 'Method' have completed. Hence, we would expect the dictionary to be garbage collected and the memory reclaimed. In reality, the memory is not freed until 'Method' is called again, creating a new WasteOfMemory instance and starting a new task. Hopefully that will clarify the issue a bit

@CONTENT:I am looking to release two version of my app: free and paid. The paid app will have a few more functions but no extra content as such. Originally I was going to release two separate apps on the market but it is proving difficult to keep a single code base and have two separate apps. Would in-app purchases be a better way to do this? So I release a free app and then allow users to purchase a unlock for the extra functions. This would also mean that I wouldn't have to explicitly use the licensing part of the Android development as that is taken care of within the in-app purchasing.

I need to create a page with endlessly rotating background - giving user an impression of rotating webcamera, for example. The first part - scrolling from left to the very right of the image is very simple - just use jQuery.animate(...). But how can I return seamlessly to the beginning of the image (after it has completed 359 degree turn), so user won't notice "jump" or something like that? Is there any examples on the web probably? I'm targeting HTML5/CSS3 (webkit) browser only, and I can use the latest jQuery. Thank you.

@TITLE:Searching over documents stored in Hadoop - which tool to use?
@CONTENT:I'm lost in: Hadoop, Hbase, Lucene, Carrot2, Cloudera, Tika, ZooKeeper, Solr, Katta, Cascading, POI... When you read about the one you can be often sure that each of the others tools is going to be mentioned. I don't expect you to explain every tool to me - sure not. If you could help me to narrow this set for my particular scenario it would be great. So far I'm not sure which of the above will fit and it looks like (as always) there are more then one way of doing what's to be done. The scenario is: 500GB - ~20 TB of documents stored in Hadoop. Text documents in multiple formats: email, doc, pdf, odt. Metadata about those documents stored in SQL db (sender, recipients, date, department etc.) Main source of documents will be ExchangeServer (emails and attachments), but not only. Now to the search: User needs to be able to do complex full-text searches over those documents. Basicaly he'll be presented with some search-config panel (java desktop application, not webapp) - he'll set date range, document types, senders/recipients, keywords etc. - fire the search and get the resulting list of the documents (and for each document info why its included in search results i.e. which keywords are found in document). Which tools I should take into consideration and which not? The point is to develop such solution with only minimal required "glue"-code. I'm proficient in SQLdbs but quite uncomfortable with Apache-and-related technologies. Basic workflow looks like this: ExchangeServer/other source -> conversion from doc/pdf/... -> deduplication -> Hadopp + SQL (metadata) -> build/update an index <- search through the docs (and do it fast) -> present search results Thank you!

@CONTENT:We all know that for-in-loops on arrays are absolutely evil. Still, they are often used and the caused errors are complicated to trace down, especially when happening browser-dependent for example because of indexOf-shims or such. So, I have coded this simple snippet which adds an enumerable getter for a "error" property on Array.prototype (not for use in production code): Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, "error", {
    enumerable: true,
    get: function() {
        if (this === Array.prototype) // that looks OK
            return undefined;

            throw new SyntaxError("Array traverse with for-in-loop, touching Array.prototype's 'error' property :-)");
    }
});
 You can add it as a greasemonkey script for all domains, and you will see alerts on nearly every site :-) Most of them are caused by calls to jQuery.extend with questionable arguments, btw. My question is now: Are there any situations that legitimate such "wrong" loops, or anything else causing false-positive alerts? I am wondering how this would affect the usefulness of my code.

@TITLE:Telerik MVC Grid with Dynamic Columns at Run Time from a Collection or Dictionary
@CONTENT:After spending the last couple days searching, I'm officially stuck. I'm working on a binding an object to the Telerik MVC 3 Grid, but the catch is that it needs to have dynamically created columns (not auto generated). Three of the columns are known, the others are unknown, and this is the tricky part. Basically, it can be like these examples: KnownColumn1 | KnownColumn2 | UnknownColumn1 | KnownColumn3 KnownColumn1 | KnownColumn2 | UnknownColumn1 | UnknownColumn2 | UnknownColumn3 | KnownColumn3 etc. Because I'm putting the unknown columns in a list (I've tried a dictionary too so I can get the column names), this has complicated things for me when binding. My code is below: Model (There can be zero to hundreds of rows, but this model is in a view model of type List, there can also be 0 to 20 plus columns that are dynamically added) public class VendorPaymentsGLAccount
{
    public string GeneralLedgerAccountNumber { get; set; }
    public string GeneralLedgerAccountName { get; set; }
    public string DisplayName { get { return string.Format("{0} - {1}", GeneralLedgerAccountNumber, GeneralLedgerAccountName); } }
    public Dictionary<string, double> MonthAmount { get; set; }
    public double Total { get { return MonthAmount.Sum(x => x.Value); } }
    public List<string> Columns { get; set; }
    public List<double> Amounts { get; set; }

    public VendorPaymentsGLAccount() { }
}

 Using the dictionary approach, I was able to get the columns generated correctly with the right header text, but the values for the columns (in my testing there were only 2 columns) were the same. Can anyone help with this? This seems to be an oddball issue. Just trying to figure out how to do this correctly. Update: Here is a screen shot using the dictionary approach that shows the issue. The column headings are correct, but the values are the same for both of the dynamic columns.

    public string GeneralLedgerAccountNumber { get; set; }

@LINK:/questions/11433195/hibernate-orderby-vs-ordercolumn-to-maintain-the-order-of-a-collection
@TITLE:Hibernate: @OrderBy vs @OrderColumn to maintain the order of a collection
@CONTENT:What is the preferred way for maintaining the order of a collection while persisting and also while retrieving from database? I know that @OrderBy is more of a in-memory sorting that might work in retrieving only when you presist the rows in the order of column you chose. Let's say I chose to use a column backed by a database sequence, will hibernate make sure that elements in collection are persisted in the same order as in collection (say List). Any thought? More details: Let¡¦s say I have a class A which has one-to-many relationship with class B. B has a primary key field, ¡¥Id¡¦, which is backed by a sequence in DB. Class A {
  List<B> bList;
}
 I always wanted to retain the order of elements B in A like below: bList = { b1, b2, b3 }
 One way to achieve is using @OrderBy (¡§Id ASC¡¨). This would work only when the list B is persisted in the order as below: ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------

1------ b1
2------ b2
3-------b3
------------------
 When we retrieve since it is ordered by Id, the order is maintained. Let¡¦say the collection B is persisted in the following way: ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------
1------ b2
2------ b1
3-------b3
------------------
 When we retrieve, the order of list B go for a toss (since it is order by Id column). So my question, if the collection B always persist in the same order as it appears in the list or not.
@CODE:Class A {
  List<B> bList;
} bList = { b1, b2, b3 } ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------

1------ b1
2------ b2
3-------b3
------------------ ----------------
Id ----bValue
----------------
1------ b2
2------ b1
3-------b3
------------------

@TITLE:C# not releasing memory after task complete
@CONTENT:The following code is a simplified example of an issue I am seeing. This application consumes approx 4GB of memory before throwing an exception as the dictionary is too big.  class Program
 {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Program program = new Program();

        while(true)
        {
            program.Method();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

    public void Method()
    {
        WasteOfMemory memory = new WasteOfMemory();
        Task tast = new Task(memory.WasteMemory);
        tast.Start();
    }


}

public class WasteOfMemory
{
     public void WasteMemory()
     {
         Dictionary<string, string> aMassiveList = new Dictionary<string, string>();

         try
         {
             long i = 0;
             while (true)
             {
                 aMassiveList.Add(i.ToString(), "I am a line of text designed to waste space.... I am exceptionally useful........");
                 i++;
             }

         }
         catch(Exception e)
         {
             Console.WriteLine("I have broken myself");
         }
     }
}
 This is all as expected, although what we cannot currently work out is when this memory should be released from the CLR. We have let the task complete and then simulated a memory overload situation, but the memory consumed by the dictionary is not released. As the OS is running out of memory, is it not putting pressure on the CLR to release the memory? However and even more confusing, if we wait until the task has completed, then hit enter to run the task again the memory is released, so obviously the previous dictionary has been garbage collected (hasn't it?). So, why is the memory not being released? And how can we get the CLR to release the memory? Any explanations or solutions would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Following replies, particularly Beska's, it is obvious my description of the issue is not the the clearest, so I will try to clarify. The code may not be the best example, sorry! It was a quick crude piece of code to try to replicate the issue. The dictionary is used here to replicate the fact we have a large custom data object, which fills a large chunk of our memory and it is not then released after the task has completed. In the example, the dictionary fills up to the limit of the dictionary and then throws an exception, it does NOT keep filling forever! This is well before our memory is full, and it does not cause an OutOfMemoryException. Hence the result is a large object in memory, and then the task completes. At this point we would expect the dictionary to be out of scope, as both the task and the method 'Method' have completed. Hence, we would expect the dictionary to be garbage collected and the memory reclaimed. In reality, the memory is not freed until 'Method' is called again, creating a new WasteOfMemory instance and starting a new task. Hopefully that will clarify the issue a bit

@TITLE:In-app purchases to unlock paid functions
@CONTENT:I am looking to release two version of my app: free and paid. The paid app will have a few more functions but no extra content as such. Originally I was going to release two separate apps on the market but it is proving difficult to keep a single code base and have two separate apps. Would in-app purchases be a better way to do this? So I release a free app and then allow users to purchase a unlock for the extra functions. This would also mean that I wouldn't have to explicitly use the licensing part of the Android development as that is taken care of within the in-app purchasing.

@TITLE:HTML5/CSS3 - how to make ¡§endless¡¨ rotating background - 360 degrees panorama
@CONTENT:i have a JPG image with the 360 degrees view of the city (9000px by 1000px). I need to create a page with endlessly rotating background - giving user an impression of rotating webcamera, for example. The first part - scrolling from left to the very right of the image is very simple - just use jQuery.animate(...). But how can I return seamlessly to the beginning of the image (after it has completed 359 degree turn), so user won't notice "jump" or something like that? Is there any examples on the web probably? I'm targeting HTML5/CSS3 (webkit) browser only, and I can use the latest jQuery. Thank you.

@TITLE:Error installing and running pywin32 2.7
@CONTENT:I am coming up with a couple errors after installing: pywin32-217.win32-py2.7 I have recently upgraded ArcGIS to 10.1 and it uses Python 2.7 (as opposed to 2.6 that came with ArcGIS 10.0) When I run the installer on a Windows 7 64 bit, it installs, but throws the following message: close failed in file object destructor: sys.excepthook is missing lost sys.stderr I had a simple python script to print to a printer from a folder containing .pdf files which worked before my upgrade import arcpy, glob, win32api, os

pdfLoc = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)

try:
    copies = int(arcpy.GetParameter(1))

    copies = 1

        win32api.ShellExecute(0, "print", pdfname, None, ".", 0)

del fullpath
del pdfname
del pdfLoc
 Now when I run the script, I get the following error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "Z:\ESRI\Python\Solstice_Tools_Scripts\Printer_Tools\Batch_Print_From_PDF_Only\BatchprintFromPDFOnly_Test.py", line 34, in win32api.ShellExecute(0, "print", pdfname, None, ".", 0) error: (31, 'ShellExecute', 'A device attached to the system is not functioning.') Failed to execute (BatchPrintFromPDFOnly2). I've been googling around and have tried a few solutions, like running the executable in troubleshooting mode, but the error persists. Can anyone suggest what may cause this? As a side note, I upgraded 4 computers in my company to the new version of python and ArcGIS, and only one of them is throwing this error. The rest work fine. Thanks, Mike

@TITLE:Get PTS from raw H264 mdat generated by iOS AVAssetWriter
@CONTENT:I'm trying to simultaneously read and write H.264 mov file written by AVAssetWriter. I managed to extract individual NAL units, pack them into ffmpeg's AVPackets and write them into another video format using ffmpeg. It works and the resulting file plays well except the playback speed is not right. How do I calculate the correct PTS/DTS values from raw H.264 data? Or maybe there exists some other way to get them? Here's what I've tried: Limit capture min/max frame rate to 30 and assume that the output file will be 30 fps. In fact its fps is always less than values that I set. And also, I think the fps is not constant from packet to packet. Remember each written sample's presentation timestamp and assume that samples map one-to-one to NALUs and apply saved timestamp to output packet. This doesn't work. Setting PTS to 0 or AV_NOPTS_VALUE. Doesn't work. From googling about it I understand that raw H.264 data usually doesn't contain any timing info. It can sometimes have some timing info inside SEI, but the files that I use don't have it. On the other hand, there are some applications that do exactly what I'm trying to do, so I suppose it is possible somehow.

@TITLE:Parsing a file with BodyParser in Scala Play20 with new lines
@CONTENT:Excuse the n00bness of this question, but I have a web application where I want to send a potentially large file to the server and have it parse the format. I'm using the Play20 framework and I'm new to Scala. For example, if I have a csv, I'd like to split each row by "," and ultimately create a List[List[String]] with each field. Currently, I'm thinking the best way to do this is with a BodyParser (but I could be wrong). My code looks something like: Iteratee.fold[String, List[List[String]]]() {
  (result, chunk) =>
    result = chunk.splitByNewLine.splitByDelimiter // Psuedocode
}
 My first question is, how do I deal with a situation like the one below where a chunk has been split in the middle of a line: Chunk 1:
1,2,3,4\n
5,6

Chunk 2:
7,8\n
9,10,11,12\n
 My second question is, is writing my own BodyParser the right way to go about this? Are there better ways of parsing this file? My main concern is that I want to allow the files to be very large so I can flush a buffer at some point and not keep the entire file in memory.
@CODE:List[List[String]] Iteratee.fold[String, List[List[String]]]() {
  (result, chunk) =>
    result = chunk.splitByNewLine.splitByDelimiter // Psuedocode
} Chunk 1:
1,2,3,4\n

@CONTENT:I'm building a file-manipulation API in Rails, and I need to be able to access it via a separate gem. The API uses Carrierwave, and that piece works with no trouble. What I don't understand how to do is to take an arbitrary file and deliver it to the API from the gem interface. Carrierwave takes its files as either the results of File.open('foo.jpg') or as a POST from a file field. I'm really not sure what either is doing, though, to serialize the file and send it along. How do I take the contents of a file and turn that into something I can pass around and post via JSON?

If I have a web api, which returns a list of cars for example - and I am working with a 3rd party (ie. not my own website or server/domain) who wants to query (get) and insert (post) lists of cars by a type, into my database, how so I authenticate them (via https)? Do they simply add (into their JSON GET/Post) something like: [
{"username":"someusername","password":"somepassword",
{
"carTypeID":12345,
"carTypeID":9876}
"carTypeID":2468}
}
}
]
 I can then grab the username and password, and check against my membership database in .net, and "IfUserAuthenticated" go on to process the rest of the JSON? Or is there a better way of doing this? I've heard of adding details to headers etc - but I'm not sure if that's for a reason, or over complicating it. I've also heard of setting tokens which are sent back to the 3rd party - if that's the best method, what instructions do I give them got building their side of the app that will use my API? Thanks for any advice/pointers, Mark

@TITLE:WCF REST basic authentication on certain methods
@CONTENT:I have quite a few RESTful (GET and POST) methods implemented in WCF 4.0. All these work over SSL. An example of some of the methods: [OperationContract]
[WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "Login?", Method = "POST", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare)]
LoginResponse Login(LoginRequest request);

[OperationContract]
[WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "UpdateDetails?", Method = "POST", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare)]
UpdateUserDetailResponse UpdateDetails(UpdateUserDetailRequest request);

[OperationContract]
[WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "GetDetails?", Method = "POST", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare)]
UserDetailResponse GetDetails(UserDetailRequest request);
 I have looked through so many blogs and forums and I still cannot find something that meets my requirements. I need to implement basic authentication on some of the methods but not all. If you look at the examples above I require a username and password to be sent through for the UpdateDetails and GetDetails method, but not for the Login method. The username and password is then authenticated against a database. Is it possible to do something like this? As a side note: these REST methods are called by many different mobile devices. I have looked at the following sites and they all implement basic authentication over REST but they cover all the methods mentioned above. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa702565.aspx Adding basic HTTP auth to a WCF REST service http://custombasicauth.codeplex.com/ (links at the bottom don't work anymore) Is it possible to do what I want to do?

@TITLE:OpenCV RotatedRect with specified angle
@CONTENT:I have the situation that I have a small binary image that has one shape, around which I want to find the best fitting rotated rectangle (not bounding rectangle). I know that there is cv::minAreaRect() that you apply on the result found by cv::findContours(), but this has delivered poor results in my case, because the data is noisy (coming from MS Kinect, see example picture where rotation changes due to the input data (contour) being slightly different). What I did instead was to calculate the principal axis using PCA on my binary image (which is less sensitive to noise), which yields angle "a", and now I want to create a RotatedRect around my shape, given the angle of the principal axis, a). I have an illustration, made with my superb Paint skills! So then my question is: do you guys have code snippets or concrete suggestions to solve this? I'm afraid that I have to do many Bresenham iterations, hoping that there is a clever approach. Btw, for those who are not too familiar with the RotatedRect data structure of openCV: it is defined by height, width, angle, and center point, assuming that center point is actually, well, in the center of the rectangle.

@TITLE:Looking for a low impact c++ profiler
@CONTENT:I am looking for a low impact, os-independent profiler for c++ code. When I say low impact, I am referring to something less intrusive than valgrind. I plan to use it in a MIPS-based embeded environment (hence the os-independance) and tried a ported version of valgrind and it completely changed the performance characteristics (way too much Heisenberg principle at work) so I cant go that route. We know the memory bus speed is a bottleneck which most-likely explains why valgrind was so intrusive. I have created a home grown type of profiler based on checkpoints that lets me measure certain parts of the code. Basically I have to modify the code (and recompile) to set checkpoints in strategic places in the code. Then, when executed, it stores the number of times each checkpoint is hit and the time since the last checkpoint was hit. Then, after running it, I can dump the checkpoints and for each it calculates: num-hits, max-time, min-time, avg-time, etc. This profiler (I called it LowImpactProfiler) works ok, but I wonder if there is something better out there. Ive considered oProfile, which is a sampling profiler, but since Im not running Linux, I think it will be really dificult to implement.

@TITLE:Real-time video(image) stitching
@CONTENT:I'm thinking of stitching images from 2 or more(currently maybe 3 or 4) cameras in real-time using OpenCV 2.3.1 on Visual Studio 2008. However, I'm curious about how it is done. Recently I've studied some techniques of feature-based image stitching method. Most of them requires at least the following step: 1.Feature detection 2.Feature matching 3.Finding Homography 4.Transformation of target images to reference images ...etc Now most of the techniques I've read only deal with images "ONCE", while I would like it to deal with a series of images captured from a few cameras and I want it to be "REAL-TIME". So far it may still sound confusing. I'm describing the detail: Put 3 cameras at different angles and positions, while each of them must have overlapping areas with its adjacent one so as to build a REAL-TIME video stitching. What I would like to do is similiar to the content in the following link, where ASIFT is used. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5OK6bwke3I I tried to consult the owner of that video but I got no reply from him:(. Can I use image-stitching methods to deal with video stitching? Video itself is composed of a series of images so I wonder if this is possible. However, detecting feature points seems to be very time-consuming whatever feature detector(SURF, SIFT, ASIFT...etc) you use. This makes me doubt the possibility of doing Real-time video stitching.

@TITLE:How do I pass a Ruby array to Javascript to make a line graph
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a webpage to display line graphs in my Ruby on Rails 2.3.14 application. I found a tool, called JS Charts, which allows me to create nice graphs using Javascript, but I am having trouble sending it the data it needs. Here is the way to make a static line graph: <script type="text/javascript">
  var myData = new Array([1, 395], [2, 244], [3, 223], [4, 210], [5, 238], [6, 223], [7, 275], [8, 31]);
  var myChart = new JSChart('chartcontainer', 'line');
  myChart.setDataArray(myData);
  myChart.draw();
</script>
 I put that code into stats.html.erb, and it shows up. However, I need it to display line graph data that I provide it. A 2 dimensional array is created in the controller: >> @a
=> [[1, 395], [2, 244], [3, 223], [4, 210], [5, 238], [6, 223], [7, 275], [8, 31]]
 I should be able to use that variable in the view, and set var myData to it, with something like: var myData = "<%= @a %>";
 I tried other things like: var myData = JSON.parse( "<%= @a.to_json %>" );
 but nothing seems to work. Is there anything I can do? EDIT: There was an issue with the array the controller passed into the view (@a), which was empty. I was able to use: var myData = JSON.parse( "<%= @a.to_json %>" );
 to display the line graph with the right data being passed into the view.
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript">
  var myData = new Array([1, 395], [2, 244], [3, 223], [4, 210], [5, 238], [6, 223], [7, 275], [8, 31]);

So here is my problem. I am trying to add James Bennett's django-registration app to my django project. I have pretty much finished configuring it to my needs - custom templates and urls. Just when I thought everything was good to go.

Interestingly, I tried reverse('testing', kwargs={'item_id':123}) in the shell and the url was returned just fine. I thought {% url %} uses reverse() in the back-end but why did I get different outcomes? urls.py: (the URLconf of my site) urlpatterns = patterns('myapp.views',
    url(r'^test/(?P<item_id>\d+)/$', 'test', name='testing'),

 I don't know if it matters but just thought I should mention activation_email.txt is stored in the templates directory of myapp though it is used by django-registration. Also, I am using django 1.4 I have a feeling that the problem has something to do with the url namespaces, a topic that I have never understood, but it's just a naive guess. (IMO, the django documentation is great in explaining everything about django, except when it comes to url namespaces)

The somewhat confusing (to me) mathematical but presumably accurate answer at Finding points on a rectangle at a given angle led me to try the following code, but it doesn't work properly. This question is similar to that one, but I'm looking for a corrected Objective-C / iOS method rather than a general mathematical response. I think a part of the code problem has to do with using the single 0 to 360 degree angle (in radians with no possibility of a negative number) input, but there are likely to be other problems. The code below mostly uses notation defined in the answer from belisarius, including my attempt to calculate intersecting points for each of the four regions defined there. This code is in my UIImageView subclass: - (CGPoint) startingPointGivenAngleInDegrees:(double)angle {
    double angleInRads = angle/180.0*M_PI;
    float height = self.frame.size.height;
    float width = self.frame.size.width;
    float x0 = self.center.x;
    float y0 = self.center.y;
    // region 1 
    if (angleInRads >= -atan2(height, width) && angleInRads <= atan2(height, width)) {
        return CGPointMake(x0 + width/2, y0 + width/2 * tan(angleInRads));
    }
    // region 2
    if (angleInRads >= atan2(height, width) && angleInRads <= M_PI - atan2(height, width)) {
        return CGPointMake(x0 + height / (2*tan(angleInRads)),y0+height/2);
    }
    // region 3
    if (angleInRads >= M_PI - atan2(height, width) && angleInRads <= M_PI + atan2(height, width)) {
        return CGPointMake(x0 - width/2, y0 + width/2 * tan(angleInRads));

@TITLE:Is there an after view change hook (much like didInsertElement)?
@CONTENT:Using the didInsertElement hook, I'm able to do some jQuery plugin initialization that is needed. However, if a property changes, Ember re-renders the view, but does not call didInsertElement again. Presumably this is because the element is already on the DOM and only certain pieces have changed. My question is, is there a method I can override, or some other way to access what's been rendered to the DOM by an Ember.View AFTER its actually inserted into the DOM? I attempted to use afterRender, but it did not work.

@TITLE:is there a better and a faster way to copy from CPU memory to GPU using thrust?
@CONTENT:Recently I have been using thrust a lot. I have noticed that in order to use thrust, one must always copy the data from the cpu memory to the gpu memory. Let's see the following example : int foo(int *foo)
{
     host_vector<int> m(foo, foo+ 100000);
     device_vector<int> s = m;
}
 I'm not quite sure how the host_vector constructor works, but it seems like I'm copying the initial data, coming from *foo, twice - once to the host_vector when it is initialized, and another time when device_vector is initialized. Is there a better way of copying from cpu to gpu without making an intermediate data copies? I know I can use device_ptras a wrapper, but that still doesn't fix my problem. thanks!

     host_vector<int> m(foo, foo+ 100000);

@CONTENT:This is one of the most vital problems I have found since I started testing Magento for my web store. It's kind of a no-brainer that it's absolutely unnecessary and harmful to sales to empty cart before payment confirmation, which unfortunately, Magento does. If the user selects PayPal (website standard) for payment method and for some reason clicks "Back to xxxx" (your business name at PayPal) on the PayPal payment page without paying, PayPal would redirect the user back to http://www.example.com/checkout/cart/, which now is an EMPTY cart. I think it should be after payment confirmation / PayPal IPN that the cart be empty-ed, instead of any point before that. Even if the user wants to continue again, he or she'd be annoyed from searching and adding all the products again and would very probably just leave. Any idea how I can work around this?

I want to do it this way so that the component doesn't need to know about the sub-classes directly (it needs to be fully modular). Let me just make this bit clear: I cannot use an Enum to choose between the sub-class types as the component cannot directly link to the sub-class types (It's simply not possible in this particular case) Anyway... thanks in advance!

Why is something trivial near impossible to do without digging through 1000 poorly written manpages?

@TITLE:Send image using socket programming Python
@CONTENT:I am trying to send an image file using socket programming in python. I am able to send a text file. But I have been trying to send an image file, by opening it and reading the contents of the image file in a string and then sending the string and receiving it on the client side and then writing it to a file with the same name in a different directory, but I am unable to open the file. Also I am posting my code below, the commented parts are an indication that I have already tried it. Also I am having problems sending the integer size but I am receiving some random string on the other side. This is the Server script import socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(("", 5000))
server_socket.listen(5)
import os


client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
print "Conencted to - ",address,"\n"
while (1):
    choice = client_socket.recv(1024)

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the latest .NET client libraries to access Version 3.0 of the Google Analytics API (Core Reporting API). I registered my application in the Google APIs Console and used OAuth 2.0 for accessing the API. Since there are no samples yet how to use the Google Analytics API, I used a sample that demonstrates the simplest use case for an OAuth2 service and applied that schema to my context - with success. (Remark: I also found help to correct the mistakes in the source code of the library Google.Apis.Analytics.v3.dll) If I use my program, I am required to login to Google, to grant permissions to my application and to copy an authorization code. I would like to skip this flow by writing my login password into the program code (- in clear text). My problem ist that I can't find this feature in the libraries. In Google Analyitcs Version 2.3, it did work with the simple C# lines: AnalyticsService asv = new AnalyticsService("");
asv.setUserCredentials(CLIENT_USERNAME, CLIENT_PASS);
 Can anybody help me?

@LINK:/questions/8851991/unraveling-the-confusion-about-embedded-resources
@TITLE:Unraveling the confusion about Embedded Resources
@CONTENT:EDIT: Read answer number 1 from Tim Schmelter and then use this question for examples of how to embed resources and access them at runtime. The subject of embedded resources comes up a lot, especially with people asking how to access the embedded files at runtime. Things get more confusing because Visual Studio gives you 2 different ways of embedding a resource, and different ways of accessing those resources at runtime. The problem is that depending on which method you used to embed the resource, the method you¡¦re trying to use to access the file at runtime might not work. This post is an attempt to clear up all the confusion that I see out there, but I also have a question that nobody can seem to answer factually: Why is the size of my compiled program TWICE the size of the embedded resource (sometimes)? For example if I embed a 20MB file into my project, why does my program compile to 40MB? I haves asked this question in the past and nobody was able to reproduce my results. I found that the reason they were not able to reproduce was because they were embedding the file in a different way. See here: Method 1: Double-click on My Project to open the property pages and go to the Resources Tab. Now click Add Resource > Add Existing File. Browse to the file you want to embed. For this example I¡¦m using an executable. You will now see your file on the Resources Tab: You will also see that a folder named Resources was created under your project and the embedded file has been placed in this folder: EDIT: THIS NEXT STEP WAS THE PROBLEM. TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU ADD A FILE VIA THE RESOURCES TAB YOU SHOULD NOT SET THE BUILD ACTION TO EMBEDDED RESOURCE. Counter intuitive to say the least! Now with the file selected, look down at the properties window for the file and change the build action to Embedded Resource: (this step should ONLY be performed when you add a file via method 2). Now compile your program. You will see that the size of your compiled program is at least double the size of your embedded resource. This does not happen with method 2. See here: Method 2: Right-click on your project name and choose Add > Existing Item. Browse to your file, and this time you will notice that while it was indeed placed under your project, there was no Resources folder created: Now once again select the file and change the Build Action to Embedded Resource and compile. This time the size of the compiled program will be as you expected - about the size of the embedded file and not double the size as with method 1. Which method you use to embed your file will determine which method you can use to access the file at runtime. For method 1 this is very simple, all you have to do is: My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes(Path, My.Resources.ResourceName, Append)
 Where Path is the location and name for the file you want to save on the harddrive, ResourceName is the name of the embedded resource that you see in the project window (minus any extension), and Append is whether or not you want to create a new file or overwrite an existing file. So for example, using test.exe from the above images, I could save that file to the C drive like this: My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes(¡§C:\test.exe¡¨, My.Resources.test, False)
 Couldn¡¦t be easier. Method 2 however doesn¡¦t appear to give you access to My.Resources so it gets a little more complicated. You have to create a Stream to hold the resource, put the stream into a byte array, then write the bytes out to the file system. The simplest way I have found to do this is like this: Using s As Stream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(Project.ResourceName)
Dim bytes(s.Length) As Byte
s.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length)
File.WriteAllBytes(OutputFile, bytes)
End Using
 With this method ResourceName must contain the file extension AND project name so using our example from above we can just do: Using s As Stream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(WindowsApplication1.test.exe)
Dim bytes(s.Length) As Byte
s.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length)
File.WriteAllBytes(¡§C:\test.exe¡¨, bytes)
End Using
 Text-based files are a little different: Dim output As String
Using sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(WindowsApplication1.test.txt))
output = sr.ReadToEnd()
End Using

Using sw As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(¡§C:\test.txt¡¨)
sw.Write(output)
End Using
 Having struggled with this in the past I hope this will help someone. And if you think you can explain factually why method 1 of embedding a resource bloats my compiled program to double its size, I would really appreciate it.
@CODE:My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes(Path, My.Resources.ResourceName, Append) My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes(¡§C:\test.exe¡¨, My.Resources.test, False) Using s As Stream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(Project.ResourceName)
Dim bytes(s.Length) As Byte
s.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length)
File.WriteAllBytes(OutputFile, bytes)
End Using Using s As Stream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(WindowsApplication1.test.exe)
Dim bytes(s.Length) As Byte
s.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length)
File.WriteAllBytes(¡§C:\test.exe¡¨, bytes)
End Using Dim output As String
Using sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(WindowsApplication1.test.txt))
output = sr.ReadToEnd()
End Using

Using sw As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(¡§C:\test.txt¡¨)

@TITLE:Mach-O symbol stubs (IOS)
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand how Mach-o files work, and have made a good deal of progress with the online resources available (In particular, the Apple page here: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/developertools/conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html), but I have hit a roadblock on understanding how symbol stubs work. Using "otool -l" I see the following section: Section
  sectname __symbolstub1
   segname __TEXT
      addr 0x00005fc0
      size 0x00000040
    offset 20416
     align 2^2 (4)
    reloff 0
    nreloc 0
     flags 0x80000408
 However when I look at the data from the binary file in a hex editor I see the following 4 bytes repeated again and again: 00005FC0  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  88
00005FD0  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  88
00005FE0  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  88  
00005FF0  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  38 F0 9F E5 38 F0 9F E5  88
 This looks something like a LDR which increases the PC by a fixed amount, but I don't see why the amount is the same for each entry in the symbol table. If someone can shed light on why this is so, or provide any resources that get this low level, please let me know. Thanks!

@CONTENT:Are the dates stored in the 'created_at' fields marshaled to Python datetime objects via PyMongo, or do I have to manually replace the text strings with Python Date objects? i.e. How do I convert a property in MongoDB from text to date type? It seems highly unnatural that I would have to replace the date strings with Python date objects, which is why I'm asking the question.

@TITLE:How To Create Generic Data Access Object (DAO) CRUD Methods with LINQ to SQL
@CONTENT:I am new to LINQ to SQL and attempting to create a generic Data Access Object (DAO) for the basic Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) methods so that I can reuse the code. I was successful in creating a generic method that will delete any entity by using the code below but, I was wondering if anyone knows how to create a generic method that will select any entity by a common Id field that exists on all tables.     /// <summary>
    /// Generic method that deletes an entity of any type using LINQ
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="entity"></param>
    /// <returns>bool indicating whether or not operation was successful</returns>

    {
        try
        {
            DomainClassesDataContext db = new DomainClassesDataContext();
            db.GetTable(entity.GetType()).Attach(entity);
            db.GetTable(entity.GetType()).DeleteOnSubmit(entity);
            db.SubmitChanges();

            Console.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace);
            return false;
        }
    }
 I am pretty sure that the same patter will work for update and insert and would like to have a generic method on the GenericDAO that will retrieve me any entity (i.e. Customer, Invoice, WorkOrder, etc...) based on the entities Id. Thanks in advance for the replies.

@TITLE:.Skip().Take() on Entity Framework Navigation Properties is executing SELECT * on my SQL Server
@CONTENT:I have a method on my generated partial class like this: var pChildren = this.Children
    .Skip(skipRelated)
    .Take(takeRelated)
    .ToList();
 When I look at my SQL Server, I can see the generated code is doing a SELECT *.* FROM Children This code is taken directly from my class, I have verified that the order of my Skip/Take is BEFORE my .ToList. If I remove the .ToList, that line is fast (and no SQL is sent to my DB), but the moment I try to foreach over the results, I get the same SQL sent to my DB: SELECT *.* FROM Children. Is there something special I need to do when using .Skip and .Take on the navigation properties of my entities? update I'll try to get the actual SQL generated, I'm not currently setup for that. I found the first one because it shows up in SSMS's "recenty expensive queries" list. Running this: var pChildren = this.Children
    //.Skip(skipRelated)
    //.Take(takeRelated)
    .ToList();
 returns ~4,000,000 rows and takes ~25 seconds. Running this: var pChildren = this.Children
    //.Skip(skipRelated)
    .Take(takeRelated)
    .ToList();
 returns ~4,000,000 rows and takes ~25 seconds. As I said, I'll grab the SQL generated for these and pose them up as well.
@CODE:var pChildren = this.Children
    .Skip(skipRelated)
    .Take(takeRelated)
    .ToList(); SELECT *.* FROM Children foreach SELECT *.* FROM Children var pChildren = this.Children

    //.Take(takeRelated)

    //.Skip(skipRelated)

@TITLE:Wrong key class: Text is not IntWritable
@CONTENT:This may seem like a stupid question, but I fail to see the problem in my types in my mapreduce code for hadoop As stated in the question the problem is that it is expecting IntWritable but I'm passing it a Text object in the collector.collect of the reducer. My job configuration has the following mapper output classes: conf.setMapOutputKeyClass(IntWritable.class);
conf.setMapOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);
 And the following reducer output classes: conf.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
conf.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);
 My mapping class has the following definition: public static class Reduce extends MapReduceBase implements Reducer<IntWritable, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable>
 with the required function: public void reduce(IntWritable key, Iterator<IntWritable> values, OutputCollector<Text,IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) 
 And then it fails when I call: output.collect(new Text(),new IntWritable());
 I'm fairly new to map reduce but all the types seem to match, it compiles but then fails on that line saying its expecting an IntWritable as the key for the reduce class. If it matters I'm using 0.21 version of Hadoop Here is my map class: public static class Map extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper<LongWritable, Text, IntWritable, IntWritable> {

This resulted in my IP being blocked by their servers within 10 minutes. I moved it to amazon EC2 and wrote a distributed python script that runs about 50 instances. This stays just above their threshold of booting me. This also costs about $1900 a month... I moved back to my initial idea and put it behind a shortened version of the TOR network. This worked, but was very slow. I'm out of ideas. How can I get past them blocking me for repeated requests. The I say "block" they are actually giving me a random 404 not found error on pages that definitely exist. It's random and only starts happening after I pass about 300 requests in an hour.

@CONTENT:I'm trying serverside reverse geocoding that can get me a json response and now I want to get 2 or 3 variables from the json response: I'd like to parse for instance this data and end with eg. administrative_area_level_1 = 'Stockholm' jsondata = json.load(urllib2.urlopen('http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=59.3,18.1&sensor=false')) Here is my python code that fetches the json, now I wonder how to parse it to get just the administrative_area_level_1 long_name (ie state or region name) locality long name (ie city name) an understanding how to parse my json I can parse it but it is not always is comes out as administrative_area_1: jsondata["results"][0]["address_components"][5]["long_name"] The line above correctly outputs "New York" for a point in New York but for Stockholm it outputs a postal city ie Johanneshow which is not the administraive_area_1 (region/state). So how guarantee that the function always returns the administrative_area_1, preferably without looping? I want it to work something like the following with direct access to country, region and city: logging.info("country:"+str(jsondata["results"][9]["formatted_address"]))
logging.info("administrative_area_level_1:"+str(jsondata["results"][8]["formatted_address"]))

logging.info("geography:"+str(jsondata["results"][1]["formatted_address"]))

@TITLE:Android: onScrollStateChanged SCROLL_STATE_IDLE sometimes doesn't fire
@CONTENT:I'm running into a bit of a problem. What I'm doing: I've got a ListView which has got some images in it. To make the scrolling smoother I've disabled the images to show up when scrolling. Now there seems to be a bug in Android which sometimes causes the scroll state to not change back from SCROLL_STATE_FLING back to SCROLL_STATE_IDLE, which causes my images to not show up again. My first thought was to set an onTouchListener and check when I get ACTION_UP, but that doesn't help because the SCROLL_STATE_FLING state is obviously being set after that. So now I've thought I could start a timer when the SCROLL_STATE_FLING state is being set and check after some time if the state is still in fling mode and then invalidate my view. But I don't think that's a very good solution. Does anyone have a better idea on how I could do that? I've seen this reply but I need a solution for API level < 9 (plus it also sometimes happen when it's not overscrolling) Here's my code for that:     mList.setOnScrollListener(new OnScrollListener() {

        @Override
        public void onScrollStateChanged(AbsListView view, int scrollState) {
            mListAdapter.setIsScrolling(scrollState != SCROLL_STATE_IDLE);
            Log.i(this, "scrollStateChanged" + scrollState);
            if (scrollState == SCROLL_STATE_IDLE) {
                mList.invalidateViews();
            }
        }

        @Override

@TITLE:Designing repositories for DI (constructor injection) for service layer
@CONTENT:I'm building an MVC3 app, trying to use IoC and constructor injection. My database has (so far) about 50 tables. I am using EF4 (w/ POCO T4 template) for my DAC code. I am using the repository pattern, and each table has its own repository. My service classes in my service layer are injected w/ these repositories. Problem: My service classes are growing in the number of repositories they need. In some cases, I am approaching 10 repositories, and it's starting to smell. Is there a common approach for designing repositories and service classes such that the services don't require so many repositories? Here are my thoughts, I'm just not sure which one is right: 1) This is a sign I should consider combining/grouping my repositories into related sections of tables, reducing the number or dependent repositories per service class. The problem with this approach, though, is that it will bloat and complicate my repositories, and will keep me from being able to use a common interface for all repositories (standard methods for data retrieval/update). 2) This is a sign I should consider breaking my services into groups based on my repositories (tables). Problem with this is that some of my service methods share common implementation, and breaking these across classes may complicate my dependencies. 3) This is a sign that I don't know what I'm doing, and have something fundamentally wrong that I'm not even able to see. UPDATE: For an idea of how I'm implementing EF4 and repositories, check out this sample app on codeplex (I used version 1). However, looking at some of the comments there (and here), looks like I need to do a bit more reading to make sure this is the route I want to take -- sounds like it may not be.

 the fasta sequence that I have is just a sequence of letters like AACCTTTGATCAAA and the graph to be generated comes like this: the code works fine with small sequences, but when I want to put a huge sequence, for example almost 40Mb of a chromosome, the program takes a lot of time and only displays a black square so that it is impossible to analyze. Is it possible to improve the aforementioned code, so that the square in which it would be displayed it would be bigger?, by the way the square must be only the square unit. Thanks for your help in advance
@CODE:genome = Import["c:\data\sequence.fasta", "Sequence"];
genome = StringReplace[ToString[genome], {"{" -> "", "}" -> ""}];

f[x_, "A"] := x/2;
f[x_, "T"] := x/2 + {1/2, 0};
f[x_, "G"] := x/2 + {1/2, 1/2};
f[x_, "C"] := x/2 + {0, 1/2};

@TITLE:NSString property copy or readonly?
@CONTENT:I see many discussions saying that I should use copy for NSString property because it will prevent others from changing it behind my back. But then why don't we just set readonly property for it? Update Thanks for answering my question. But the thing is that for NSString property, you always don't want others to modify it, right? You may modify it yourself but definitely not others. I guess most of time NSString get its initial value set up (either by you or by others), after that only you will modify it. Then why not just use readonly property Actually I use copy most of time. But then I realize most of time I only use those setters in my init method. So I think I should use readonly instead of copy for those case. So let me ask question in this way: if you only use those setters for your NSStrings in your init method, then you should use readonly instead. Is this a reasonable conclusion ?

@TITLE:StructureMap, NHibernate and multiple databases
@CONTENT:I'm working on an Asp.Net MVC 3 application using Fluent NHibernate. I'm just attempting to add an IoC container using StructureMap. I have implemented a custom controller factory which uses StructureMap to create the controller and inject dependencies. Each controller constructor takes one or more services, which in turn take a DAO as constructor argument. Each DAO constructor takes an ISessionFactory. For my StructureMap NHibernate registry I have the following: internal class NHibernateRegistry : Registry
{
    public NHibernateRegistry()
    {
        var connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["AppDb"].ConnectionString;

        For<ISessionFactory>()
                .Singleton()
                .Use(x => new AppSessionFactory().GetSessionFactory(connectionString));

        For<ISession>()
            .HybridHttpOrThreadLocalScoped()
            .Use(x => x.GetInstance<ISessionFactory>().OpenSession());
    }

}

public class AppSessionFactory
{
    public ISessionFactory GetSessionFactory(string connectionString)
    {
        return GetConfig(connectionString)
                .BuildSessionFactory();
    }

    public static FluentConfiguration GetConfig(string connectionString)
    {
        return Fluently.Configure()
            .Database(MsSqlConfiguration.MsSql2005.ConnectionString(x => x.Is(connectionString)))
            .Mappings(
                x => x.FluentMappings.AddFromAssemblyOf<AppEntity>());
    }
}
 This all works fine for a single database and single session factory. However the application uses multiple databases. What is the best way to handle this?

@TITLE:Xcode 4: Can't use Enable Guard Malloc due to dylib error for iPad simulator
@CONTENT:In Xcode 4.x I've edited my Run scheme to 'Enable Guard Malloc' since I have a nondescript malloc error I need to track down. I'm aware I need to run in the simulator to use this feature. However, when I do so the app immediately freezes and Xcode shows me a stack trace that looks like this: I've googled around to find a solution, but thus far no joy. It was reported elsewhere that I should be setting an environment variable in my scheme: DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES  ->  /usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib
 However this doesn't solve the problem. I have also tried 'lsystem' as the value, but that didn't work either. Can anyone suggest a solution to this dylib issue, or perhaps recommend an alternative to 'Enable Guard Malloc' to identify where a malloc'd heap area is being exceeded? UPDATE To clarify, this is the type of error I'm dealing with: malloc: *** error for object 0x2b4b54: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
 I've tried setting a symbol breakpoint of malloc_error_break, however it still breaks 'randomly' upon memory issues rather than at the point of exceeding an allocated region.

@TITLE:How to upload/POST multiple canvas elements
@CONTENT:I have to create an image uploader for a future project (No flash, IE10+, FF7+ etc.) that does image resizing/converting/cropping on the clientside and not on the server. So I made a javascript interface where the user can 'upload' their files and get resized/cropped in the browser directly, without ever contacting the server. The performance is OK, not that good, but it works. The endresult is an array of canvas elements. The user can edit/crop the images after they got resized, so I keep them as canvas instead of converting them to jpeg. (Which would worsen the initial performance) Now this works fine, but I don't know what's the best way to actually upload the finished canvas elements to the server now. (Using a asp.net 4 generic handler on the server) I have tried creating a json object from all elements containing the dataurl of each canvas. The problem is, when I got 10-40 pictures, the browser starts freezing when creating the dataurls, especially for images that are larger than 2 megabyte.             //images = array of UploadImage
            for (var i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {
                var data = document.getElementById('cv_' + i).toDataURL('image/jpg');
                images[i].data = data.substr(data.indexOf('base64') + 7);
            }
 Also converting them to a json object (I am using json2.js) usually crashes my browser. (FF7) My object     var UploadImage = function (pFileName, pName, pDescription) {
        this.FileName = pFileName;
        this.Name = pName;
        this.Description = pDescription;

@TITLE:Lucas Kanade Optical Flow, Direction Vector
@CONTENT:I am working on optical flow, and based on the lecture notes here and some samples on the Internet, I wrote this Python code. All code and sample images are there as well. For small displacements of around 4-5 pixels, the direction of vector calculated seems to be fine, but the magnitude of the vector is too small (that's why I had to multiply u,v by 3 before plotting them). Is this because of the limitation of the algorithm, or error in the code? The lecture note shared above also says that motion needs to be small "u, v are less than 1 pixel", maybe that's why. What is the reason for this limitation?

The reason I'm asking the question is that to do so is reinventing a queueing system. Not only are there lots of queuing systems out there but as this well worded post from Percona points out, it's a good idea not to roll your own: http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you/ Have you implemented a digest email, did you use delayed_job & what did you learn?

@CONTENT:I'm writing an application for Android which let users browse a list of files and download them. For every download, I created a thread and I download the file with an HttpURLConnection instance (by reading from the connection in a while loop). This method works fine with one active download. But when user starts more than one, download performance degrades dramatically. Most of the time, these parallel downloads consume all the bandwidth and the users is unable to browse files (which uses another HttpUrlConnection to load the files list). Any suggestions on refining the download system? Thanks. P.S.: The method that popular browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox do seems good. Anyone knows how they work?

@LINK:/questions/7550582/when-to-choose-nls-over-loess
@TITLE:When to choose nls() over loess()?
@CONTENT:If I have some (x,y) data, I can easily draw straight-line through it, e.g. f=glm(y~x)
plot(x,y)
lines(x,f$fitted.values)
 But for curvy data I want a curvy line. It seems loess() can be used: f=loess(y~x)
plot(x,y)
lines(x,f$fitted)
 This question has evolved as I've typed and researched it. I started off with wanting to a simple function to fit curvy data (where I know nothing about the data), and wanting to understand how to use nls() or optim() to do that. That was what everyone seemed to be suggesting in similar questions I found. But now I stumbled upon loess() I'm happy. So, now my question is why would someone choose to use nls or optim instead of loess (or smooth.spline)? Using the toolbox analogy, is nls a screwdriver and loess is a power-screwdriver (meaning I'd almost always choose the latter as it does the same thing but with less of my effort)? Or is nls a flat-head screwdriver and loess a cross-head screwdriver (meaning loess is a better fit for some problems, but for others it simply won't do the job)? For reference, here is the play data I was using that loess gives satisfactory results for: x=1:40
y=(sin(x/5)*3)+runif(x)
 And: x=1:40
y=exp(jitter(x,factor=30)^0.5)
 Sadly, it does less well on this: x=1:400
y=(sin(x/20)*3)+runif(x)
 Can nls(), or any other function or library, cope with both this and the previous exp example, without being given a hint (i.e. without being told it is a sine wave)? UPDATE: Some useful pages on the same theme on stackoverflow: Goodness of fit functions in R How to fit a smooth curve to my data in R? smooth.spline "out of the box" gives good results on my 1st and 3rd examples, but terrible (it just joins the dots) on the 2nd example. However f=smooth.spline(x,y,spar=0.5) is good on all three. UPDATE #2: gam() (from mgcv package) is great so far: it gives a similar result to loess() when that was better, and a similar result to smooth.spline() when that was better. And all without hints or extra parameters. The docs were so far over my head I felt like I was squinting at a plane flying overhead; but a bit of trial and error found: #f=gam(y~x)    #Works just like glm(). I.e. pointless
f=gam(y~s(x)) #This is what you want
plot(x,y)
lines(x,f$fitted)

(path: /admin/*) I have already overdid the error404.html.twig view (at app/Resources/TwigBundle/views/Exception/) for the website.

//returns NULL
 Calling the $event->container->get('templating')->render() function. I end up with an infinite loop (blank page) as the script fails. The only things I've got working are: Retrieving the exception code: $exception = $event->getException();
$code = $exception->getCode();

$event->setResponse($response);

@TITLE:Building a tag cloud with solr
@CONTENT:Dear stackoverflow community : Given some text, I wish to get the TOP 50 most frequent words in the text, and create a tag cloud out of it, and thus show the gist of what the text is about in a graphical way. The text is actually a set of 100 or so comments PER each ITEM(a picture) there are about 120 items, and I also want to keep the cloud updated - by keeping the comments indexed, and using the cloud generation code to run each time a new web request turns up. I settled on using Solr to index the text, and now wondering how to get the TOP 50 words, out of Solr TermsVectorComponant. Here is an example of the results returned by the terms vector componant, after you turn on term frequency by saying tv.tf="true" :   <lst name="doc-5">
    <str name="uniqueKey">MA147LL/A</str>    
    <lst name="includes">
      <lst name="cabl"><tf>5</tf></lst>

      <lst name="cabl"><tf>5</tf></lst>
      <lst name="usb"><tf>4</tf></lst>
    </lst>
  </lst>
 As you can see I have 2 problems : I get all the terms within the document, for that field, not just top 100 And They are not sorted by frequency, so I have to get terms and sort it in-memory to do what im trying. Is there a better way? (or) Can I tell solr termvector component to somehow sort it and pick up only 100 for me? (or) Is there some other framework which I can use? I need to keep new comments indexed as they come, so the tag cloud is always uptodate - As to the cloud generator it takes a dictionary of weighted words, and makes it into a nice image. This answer does not help. EDIT - trying out jpountz & paige cook's answer Here is a result which I got for this query :     select?q=Id:d4439543-afd4-42fb-978a-b72eab0c07f9&facet=true

 I got 50 such elements, @jpountz thanks for helping limit the results, BUT why does ALL FIFTY of the individual <int> elements hold the value 1? My thoughts are : The number 1 represents the count of the documents matching my query (which can only be one since I queried by Id:Guid) and they do not represent the frequency of the words in Post_Content To prove this I removed the Id:GUID from query and result was: <int name="content">33</int>

<int name="i">15</int>
<int name="do">14</int>
<int name="have">14</int>
<int name="my">14</int>
 My problem is how to get the term frequency in the document, and not the document frequency of many terms. For example I know for a fact that bootable was a word I used 6 times in Post_content, So i want sorted Pairs like (6,"bootable"), (5, "disc") for a set of documents.

@TITLE:Rails model structure for users
@CONTENT:I'm new to rails, and I'm working on my second rails app. The app will have different roles for users, but some users will have multiple roles. Every user of the site will be an Artist. Some users will have the role of a moderator. How would I structure this? In some PHP apps I've used, there is only one user, and then a database column for is_admin, etc. But I've looked at the source for rails apps and have seen separate models for User and Admin, etc. although I'm not sure why. So, should I have a single User model with a role attribute, which could be Moderator, and then just call Users "Artists" in my views, routes, etc.? Or should I have a User model, a Moderator model which inherits from it, and an Artist model which belongs_to User? I'm really confused.

@TITLE:Is there a new standard web page width? How many pixels?
@CONTENT:I am just building a new site for a client and want to make sure I serve him best. I am at the process of determining the page width. First, for the last few years, my pages have been typically about 900 pixels wide and centered in the middle of the browser window. This works really well. That's not the approach I am taking now though. My old standard of 900-1000 pixels seems really small on today's monitors. I am creating a three column page layout. The leftmost column needs to stick to the left side of the browser. If the browser is set really wide, there is a huge vertical dead zone on the right side of the browser. That's not really a problem since I doubt most people open their browser to 100% wide on a 1600px monitor. My question is this: Is there a standard pixel width that you assume 90% of the people use to view a web site?

@TITLE:DRY user-input validation (clientside, serverside) using JSON-schema
@CONTENT:As part of a extensive test-case, I'm building an ajax-based CMS-like application which provides CRUD-functionality on various documenttypes, e.g: articles, tags, etc. on the server and client-side I'm considering to use JSON-schema ( http://json-schema.org/ ) as a way to do user input validation in a DRY way (i.e: 1 validation-schema, to be used both on the server and client-side, no duplicate-code and all that) . This seems great, because: JSON-schema is both implemented in JS and Java, so one schema could in theory handle client-side and server-side validation all CUD-operations requests and responses are JSON (through ajax) However besides the usual validations on user-input I would like to have some additional checks on the server (e.g: like checking if the name of a Tag a user wants to create already exists) Ideally, I want these type of checks to be included in my general server-side validation code (which as said would be based on JSON-schema). However, I'm not entirely convinced that this is the right approach, because these additional checks are not based on the provided JSON-data alone, but need additional data to validate (e.g: the names of existing tags in the system to check if a tag-name already exists). So, would it be a good idea (design / architectual wise) to incorporate additional checks like the one described above in the json-schema based validation-framework on the server-side? Would this be an elegant solution? Or would you keep them seperate altogether? If not, why not and what other alternative approached would you suggest to stay DRY concerning client and server-side validation? What do you think? Some additional context/ goals of the text-case below for some background info. Thanks, Geert-Jan Some context / goals: ajax-based CMS using REST approach CUD-requests are performed through ajax using a rest approach (i.e: mapping on POST, PUT, DELETE respectively). Requests and responses are all done through JSON. CMS without forms. Instead use in-place editing (e.g using Aloha-editor: http://www.aloha-editor.org/ staying DRY. templating: done through Mustache templating on client and server-side. Intial rendering and incremental rendering through ajax are done based on 1 and the same template. I wanted to go for something different than Mustache (bc. of it's lack of expressive power), but it works for this prototype at least. (See previous question for alternatives, on which I'm still looking for an answer: Client-side templating language with java compiler as well (DRY templating) ) DRY input-validation: as described above Validation flow ( in case of failure): user creates/updates/deletes item. a validation-failure on the client would instantly give feedback to the user as what to repair. (The Javascript JSON-schema-validator would ideally return JSON which is formatted to the user) when client-side validation succeeds, the CUD-operation is performed using ajax. if server-side validation fails, a status-code 400 (Bad request) is returned, with a Json-object containing the validation-failure(s) which is picked up by jquery's error-callback $.ajax({
    ....
    error: function(xhr, status, error) {
        var validationJSON = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        //handle server-side validation failure 
    },
    ....
});
 JSON-object containing server-side validation failures are presented to the user (analogously to client-side)
@CODE:$.ajax({
    ....
    error: function(xhr, status, error) {
        var validationJSON = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        //handle server-side validation failure

As i understand, i have to use Javascript SDK for login, then using PHP SDK i will check my database for verifying credentials. But using Graph API with PHP SDK is slow. Is there a better way to validate session? Will i need to check session server-side (PHP-SDK) on every request?

@CONTENT:I have a gray scale image that I want to display in color by mapping the gray scale values with a color palette (like colormap in Matlab). I managed to do it by using OpenCV cvSet2D function, but I would like to access to the pixels directly for performance reasons. But when I do that the image has strange colors.

for (int y=0; y<temp->height; y++)
{
    uchar* ptr1 = (uchar*) ( temp->imageData + y * temp->widthStep );

        int intensity = (int)ptr2[x];

@CONTENT:I have a COM server (C++/STA (MFC based app)) and a COM client (C#/MTA). The COM server must live in an STA, since it's an MFC app (I have no choice in this matter). The client issues a call to the server, and the server issues a callback to the client. That's where the error happens (RPC_E_CANTCALLOUT_ININPUTSYNCCALL). I'm guessing if the server had been an MTA, this problem would never have arised, but sadly, the documentation for MFC explicitly denies initializing the apartment as an MTA. Any ideas on how to work around this problem? I have been toying with the idea of letting the server object (the object I expose through the running object table) live in an apartment of its own (MTA). Would this be a good idea, or is there something simpler to try first? UPDATE The server object is just a thin interface point to certain functions within the application. Most of the time it just reads and writes to memory locations, but there are instances where it generates window messages to various windows within the application. The server object itself is not the entire application.

@CONTENT:I'm currently working on a project, where we have the challenge to process items in parallel. So far not a big deal ;) Now to the problem. We have a list of IDs, where we periodically (every 2 sec's) what to call a StoredProcedure for each ID. The 2 sec's need to be checked for each item individually, as they are added and removing during runtime. In addition we want to configure the maximum degree of parallelism, as the DB should not be flooded with 300 threads concurrently. An item which is being processed should not be rescheduled for processing until it has finished with the previous execution. Reason is that we want to prevent queueing up a lot of items, in case of delays on the DB. Right now we are using a self-developed component, that has a main thread, which periodically checks what items need to scheduled for processing. Once it has the list, it's dropping those on a custom IOCP-based thread pool, and then uses waithandles to wait for the items being processed. Then the next iteration starts. IOCP because of the work-stealing it provides. I would like to replace this custom implementation with a TPL/.NET 4 version, and I would like to know how you would solve it (ideally simple and nicely readable/maintainable). I know about this article: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee789351.aspx, but it's just limiting the amount of threads being used. Leaves work stealing, periodically executing the items .... Ideally it will become a generic component, that can be used for some all the tasks that need to be done periodically for a list of items. any input welcome, tia Martin

@TITLE:AVAudioRecorder doesn't write out proper WAV File Header
@CONTENT:I'm working on a project on the iPhone where I'm recording audio from the device mic using AVAudioRecorder, and then will be manipulating the recording. To ensure that I'm reading in the samples from the file correctly, I'm using python's wave module to see if it returns the same samples. However, python's wave module returns "fmt chunk and/or data chunk missing" when trying to open the wav file that is saved by AVAudioRecorder. These are the settings I am using to record the file: [audioSettings setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:kAudioFormatLinearPCM] forKey:AVFormatIDKey];
[audioSettings setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:16] forKey:AVLinearPCMBitDepthKey];
[audioSettings setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] forKey:AVLinearPCMIsBigEndianKey];

[audioSettings setObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1] forKey:AVNumberOfChannelsKey];
[audioSettings setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES] forKey:AVLinearPCMIsNonInterleaved];
[audioSettings setObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO] forKey:AVLinearPCMIsFloatKey]; 
 After that, I'm just making a call to recordForDuration to actually do the recording. The recording succeeds-- I can play the file etc, and I can read in the samples using AudioFile services, but I can't validate it because I can't open the file with Python's wave module. This is what the first 128 bytes of the file look like: 1215N:~/Downloads$ od -c --read-bytes 128 testFile.wav

 Where could I run this script in order to update the password field in my DB? Thanks, Steve
@CODE:<?php
require_once DRUPAL_ROOT . '/' . variable_get('password_inc', 'includes/password.inc');
$old_hash = md5('password');
$hash_count_log2 = 11;

$new_hash = user_hash_password($old_hash, $hash_count_log2);

if ($new_hash) {
  // Indicate an updated password.
  $new_hash  = 'U' . $new_hash;
}
?>

@TITLE:LuaInterface - how-to restrict access to .Net classes?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to embed some Lua scripting functionality in my C# app by using LuaInterface 2.0.3. This is working just fine so far, but I can't figure out how to restrict access to only few specified .Net classes. By default, all .Net libraries are directly accessible through "luanet" and Lua scripts are free to open new windows or access the file system. e.g. this Lua script will open a new Window:    Form = luanet.System.Windows.Forms.Form
   mainForm = Form()
   mainForm:ShowDialog()
 Freedom of scripting is great and all, but this is likely to interfere with the hosting app and has some security-related implications I'm not too fond of. Is there any way to disable this?
@CODE:Form = luanet.System.Windows.Forms.Form
   mainForm = Form()

I'm planning to build an augmented reality app for android mobile platform and the main feature is the ability of the user to take a shoot of a shop and the application recognize the shop that he is photographing. I Do not know if the best option would be to use an image recognition api as many existing, but I think it would be something more specific. Maybe own a bank of images would help. My plan was to have a database of stores with their locations and use one of many tools for image recognition and search in my database to the same location. But I found that all search engines images (kooba, iqengines, etc.) are not free and not a little cheaper. So would a tool that could use a limited catalog, like shops images in a shopping mall for example and send photos of smartphones (both android or iphone). Can someone help me get started?

@TITLE:Programming OOP in Javascript - Properly
@CONTENT:I'm interesting in improving my javascript code to be properly OOP.... currently I tend to do something like this: jQuery(document).ready(function () {
    Page.form = (function () {
        return {
            //generate a new PDF
            generatePDF: function () {

            //Update the list of PDFs available for download
            updatePDFDownloads: function () {

            },
            /*
             * Field specific functionality
             */
            field: (function () {
                return {
                    //show the edit prompt
                    edit: function (id, name) {

            }())
        };
    }());
});
 In the end it's just mainly organized functions I suppose... what's a good resource where I can learn to program javascript in an OOP manner, or what suggestions would you have for improving my current style of programming? It seems like I should do a sort of model prototype and have my form object inherit from that prototype. (I'm using jQuery instead of $ because of conflicts with prototypeJS)

@TITLE:The REST-way to check/uncheck like/unlike favorite/unfavorite a resource
@CONTENT:Currently I am developing an API and within that API I want the signed in users to be able to like/unlike or favorite/unfavorite two resources. My "Like" model (it's a Ruby on Rails 3 application) is polymorphic and belongs to two different resources: /api/v1/resource-a/:id/likes
 and /api/v1/resource-a/:resource_a_id/resource-b/:id/likes
 The thing is: I am in doubt what way to choose to make my resources as RESTful as possible. I already tried the next two ways to implement like/unlike structure in my URL's: Case A: (like/unlike being the member of the "resource") PUT /api/v1/resource/:id/like maps to Api::V1::ResourceController#like
PUT /api/v1/resource/:id/unlike maps to Api::V1::ResourceController#unlike
 and case B: ("likes" is a resource on it's own) POST /api/v1/resource/:id/likes maps to Api::V1::LikesController#create
DELETE /api/v1/resource/:id/likes maps to Api::V1::LikesController#destroy
 In both cases I already have a user session, so I don't have to mention the id of the corresponding "like"-record when deleting/"unliking". I would like to know how you guys have implemented such cases! Update April 15th, 2011: With "session" I mean HTTP Basic Authentication header being sent with each request and providing encrypted username:password combination.
@CODE:/api/v1/resource-a/:id/likes /api/v1/resource-a/:resource_a_id/resource-b/:id/likes PUT /api/v1/resource/:id/like maps to Api::V1::ResourceController#like
PUT /api/v1/resource/:id/unlike maps to Api::V1::ResourceController#unlike POST /api/v1/resource/:id/likes maps to Api::V1::LikesController#create

@LINK:/questions/5655302/what-are-the-consequences-of-storing-a-c-sharp-string-utf-16-in-a-sql-server-n
@TITLE:What are the consequences of storing a C# string (UTF-16) in a SQL Server nvarchar (UCS-2) column?
@CONTENT:It seems that SQL Server uses Unicode UCS-2, a 2-byte fixed-length character encoding, for nchar/nvarchar fields. Meanwhile, C# uses Unicode UTF-16 encoding for its strings (note: Some people don't consider UCS-2 to be Unicode, but it encodes all the same code points as UTF-16 in the Unicode subset 0-0xFFFF, and as far as SQL Server is concerned, that's the closest thing to "Unicode" it natively supports in terms of character strings.) While UCS-2 encodes the same basic code points as UTF-16 in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), it doesn't reserve certain bit patterns that UTF-16 does to allow for surrogate pairs. If I write a C# string to an SQL Server nvarchar (UCS-2) field and read it back, will this always return the same result? It seems that while UTF-16 is a superset of UCS-2 in the sense that UTF-16 encodes more code points (e.g. above 0xFFFF), it's actually a sub-set of UCS-2 at the 2-byte level, since it's more restrictive. To answer my own question, I suspect that if my C# string contains code points above 0xFFFF (represented by pairs of characters), these would be stored and retrieved just fine in the database, but if I tried to manipulated them in the database (e.g. perhaps calling TOUPPER or attempting to blank-out every other character), then I could run into some problems displaying the string later... unless SQL Server has functions that acknowledge surrogate pairs and effectively treat nchar/nvarchar strings as UTF-16.

@CONTENT:I have kernel driver. When installing on 32 bit systems and Windows XP and below, I had no problem and used SetupCopyOEMInf, but 64 bit drivers are required to be signed. I have signed it and I need to have a cat file with the driver copied somewhere on the computer, and this method of install doesn't work. How should I install it? EDIT: Clarified the question.

@TITLE:zxing integration into monodroid app
@CONTENT:I'm trying to integrate ZXing's barcode scanner into a MonoDroid application. I see that normal Android (java) apps have IntentIntegration.java and IntentResult.java to include into their project to help. I was wondering if anyone has ported those to .NET (I didn't see them ported in the csharp project.)? I'm also wondering if anyone has implemented ZXing in another way to get to work with their app? If anyone has integrated with MonoDroid, what needs to be done to initiate a scan in a button click handler? Also, if anyone has any other 3 party barcode scanner that could be implemented instead, put those suggestions in the comments.

@TITLE:Yet another image download question
@CONTENT:I know that this was disscused many times before, but I've got memory leak using LazyList and I've got no ideas how to fix it. I use one instance of ImageLoader in whole app, I create it in Application.onCreate(), because I need image downloading in several activities: list activity, one activity with gallery widget and full-screen gallery activitiy(all of them use same cache) I modified image loader so it uses SoftReference-based HashMap.

 And the worst part: after some time I receive OOM exception when ImageLoader tries to decode another bitmap. I'll appreciate any your help. Thanks. EDIT I've got rid of hard cache, but i still get this OOM exception. It seems to me that I'm doing smth funny. I don't even know what extra information should I provide... The images which i download from server are pretty big, though. And app fails to allocate appr. 1.5 mb, that's what I see in LogCat. But I just can't figure out why doesn't vm clear my SoftHashMap if there is need for memory...

@TITLE:Building a C# Web API - REST
@CONTENT:I am about to start a project in C#. I've never used c# and I was hoping I could get some implementation advice before I make a silly mistake and go down the wrong path. What I am trying to achieve is basically having a C# application on a server that can be accessed via a Web API. This application will take in some string variables and then return a string. The application will be opening and running some installed programs (not c# programs). I've read about WCF but I think at first glance this might be overkill as the API I am hoping to create will only have one or two request methods and will return a string. What I am really looking for is advice on what I should be using, what to look into and even links to good tutorials on building web services with C# and how I can make the link between a web API to a C# app. Thanks all for any advice.

@TITLE:User Defined Dynamic Workflows in Workflow Foundation 4?
@CONTENT:I have been, exhaustively, looking at examples of WF4 and am not sure it will work for my project. I need to be convinced otherwise. I am struggling with how we would implement a system to use WF4 so users have the ability to define workflows. It seems you need VS2010 experience to design and implement a WF4 workflow. I love wheat it can offer, but feel it may be too complicated for non techical users. Do we just define a ton of custom activies that a user can move into a workflow? How can we make it as easy as possible for a user to build the workflow? We have and application that we want to allow, Joe / Jane user to create their own workflows for specific items. For example, Request For Information items. The RFI has specific states it can be in that are defined by the user. They should be allowed to control the flow based on those states. There will be some base items that the application defines as to what will happen based on a decision / condition. So, things like notifications (who gets notified when something changes), time frames (how long something can stay in a certain state before something else happens), and possibly some other conditions. The conditions / decision types will be limited by the application, for now. But imagine they can build the workflow and add those decisions / conditions in without any coding knowledge. I just don¡¦t know how we can leverage WF4 in this way. Maybe I am looking at WF4 the wrong way?

@TITLE:How can i use EF Code First to declare a one-to-many relationship?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to define a simple one-to-many relationship between two poco's, using the Entity Framework fluent API. ~ Team ~
public int TeamId { get; set; }
public ICollection<User> TeamMembers { get; set; } // All the team players. Two way nav.
public Player CreatedBy { get; set; } // Which player created this team. One way navigation.
                                      // Optional. Not all players create a team.

~ Player ~
public int PlayerId { get; set; }
public Team Team { get; set; } // The other side of the TeamMembers navigation.
 NOTES: A player doesn't have to be in a team. (unassigned/dropped players). A team might have no players (they have all left/quit). The closest I thought I got was something like this... protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Team>()
        .HasOptional(x => x.TeamMembers)
        .WithMany()
        .WillCascadeOnDelete(false);
}
 ... Which doesn't work .. and i'm not sure how to define the other navs also. Can anyone help, please?

@LINK:/questions/5232461/serializing-sqlalchemy-models-for-a-rest-api-while-respecting-access-control
@TITLE:Serializing SQLAlchemy models for a REST API while respecting access control?
@CONTENT:Currently, the way our, as well as most web frameworks', serialization works is there's some type of method invocation which dumps the model into some type of format. In our case, we have a to_dict() method on every model that constructs and returns a key-value dictionary with the key being the field name and the value being the instance variable. All throughout our code, we have snippets like the following: json.dumps(**some_model_object.to_dict()) which will serialize a some_model_object to json. Recently, we've decided to expose some internal resources to our users, but some of these resources have specific private instance values that we do not want to transmit back during serialization if the requesting user is not a super user. I'm trying to come up with a clean design that will allow easier serialization, as well as allow us to serialize to a format other than json. I think this is a pretty good use case for Aspect Oriented Design/Programming, where the aspects respect the requesting access controls and serialize the object based on the requesting user's persmissions. Here's something similar to what I have now: from framework import current_request


class User(SQLAlchemyDeclarativeModel):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = Column(Unicode(255))
    last_name = Column(Unicode(255))
    private_token = Column(Unicode(4096))

    def to_dict(self):
        serialized = dict((column_name, getattr(self, column_name))
                          for column_name in self.__table__.c.keys())

        # current request might not be bound yet, could be in a unit test etc.
        if current_request and not current_request.user.is_superuser():
            # we explicitly define the allowed items because if we accidentally add
            # a private variable to the User table, then it might be exposed.
            allowed = ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name']
            serialized = dict((k, v) for k, v in serialized.iteritems() if k in allowed)

        return serialized
 As one can see, this is less than ideal because now I have to couple the database model with the current request. While this is very explicit, the request coupling is a code smell and I'm trying to see how to do this cleanly. One way I've thought about doing it is to register some fields on the model like so: class User(SQLAlchemyDeclarativeModel):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    __public__ = ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name']
    __internal__ = User.__exposed__ + ['private_token']

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = Column(Unicode(255))
    last_name = Column(Unicode(255))
    private_token = Column(Unicode(4096))
 Then, I would have a serializer class that is bound with the current request on every WSGI call that will take the desired serializer. For example: import simplejson

from framework import JSONSerializer  # json serialization strategy
from framework import serializer

# assume response format was requested as json
serializer.register_serializer(JSONSerializer(simplejson.dumps))
serializer.bind(current_request)
 Then in my view somewhere, I would just do: from framework import Response

user = session.query(User).first()
return Response(code=200, serializer.serialize(user))
 serialize would be implemented as follows: def serialize(self, db_model_obj):
    attributes = '__public__'
    if self.current_request.user.is_superuser():
        attributes = '__private__'

    payload = dict((c, getattr(db_model_obj, c)) 
                   for c in getattr(db_model_obj, attributes))

    return self.serialization_strategy.execute(payload)
 Thoughts on this approach's readability and clarity? Is this a pythonic approach to the problem? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Android MediaRecorder setOutPutFile() to stream using Socket
@CONTENT:I am developing an Android app that should be capable of streaming video to a local server on my network without storing it on SD card. For this I have made simple socket application in C# that listens to the specific IP:PORT On Android part, I had set the setOutputFile() to this IP:PORT using socket. This application starts perfectly on Android phone but it does not display preview and when I start recording it exits without any exception. It also do not send any data stream to the network. When I set the setOutPutFile() to SD card, it works perfectly and records video also. For the server part, when I send the data from any other app (from PC) to the same IP:PORT, it receives the data. In short, I want to establish the communication channel between PC and Android using socket for streaming. Here is my Android code:  Socket soc=new Socket("192.168.1.3",8210);
 ParcelFileDescriptor pfd = ParcelFileDescriptor.fromSocket(soc);
 ...
 ...
 // other Recorder setup steps
 ...
 ...
 Recorder.setOutputFile(pfd.getFileDescriptor()); // working fine for sdcard
 Recorder.setPreviewDisplay(holder.getSurface());
 Recorder.prepare();
 Here is my server app that is in C# and runs on PC:  socketForServer = new TcpClient("192.168.1.3", 8210);
 NetworkStream networkStream = socketForServer.GetStream();
 byte[] rData = new byte[1024];
 networkStream.Read(rData, 0, 1024);

 // process rData

@TITLE:iPad: Detecting External Keyboard
@CONTENT:My app uses a UIAccessoryView to provide additional keyboard functionality (such as forward/backward tabs and arrows keys) for the virtual keyboard, but that causes UIKeyboardDidShowNotification to fire even when a physical keyboard is present (the accessory appears at the bottom of the screen). I'd like to check if a physical keyboard is attached when handling UIKeyboardWillShowNotification, to prevent the accessory view from appearing and to prevent my custom view from scrolling up (to make room for the non-existent virtual keyboard). I've tried examining the UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey key, but it returns a real size for the virtual keyboard, in spite of nothing being displayed. Is there any way to detect the presence of a physical keyboard to prevent this unwanted behaviour? Hmm, the plot thickens. I tried disabling the input accessory by returning nil from the inputAccessoryView property of the Responder object which triggers the keyboard. That suppresses UIKeyboardWillShowNotification and UIKeyboardDidShowNotification when there is a physical keyboard present, but keeps these notifications when there is no such keyboard. All good so far. Then I tried re-enabling inputAccessoryView only after UIKeyboardWillShowNotification had been received. This only fires when a virtual keyboard is needed, so it should allow me to reintroduce the accessory view in those circumstances. Or so I thought. Unfortunately, it seems the OS doesn't check inputAccessoryView after UIKeyboardWillShowNotification, so it fails to show the accessory view when it is needed :o( That leaves me with two options: Include the input accessory view, giving extra functionality for virtual keyboard users, but lose the ability to detect a physical keyboard and hence not supporting physical devices; or Exclude the input accessory altogether, preventing most users from accessing the extra keys, but allowing the app to work with a physical keyboard. Not a great choice, so I'm still keen to see if anyone else has addressed this problem!

@CONTENT:I'm adding several CALayers as sublayers of the layer of a UIView. The contents of each layer is a different image downloaded from a server. Each layer is animated from offscreen to a randomly generated position. The image data is downloaded asynchronously. Each image is approx 300x300 or smaller. As a result of the random placement, the layers overlap and some are obscured by the layers above them. This is all good. I'm removing layers as they become completely obscured from view using the suggestion in the answer to this question The calculations to determine coverage occur on a separate thread. I have a UIPanGestureRecognizer that allows the user to drag the layers around on the screen. I'm encountering a performance problem when the number of layers added approaches 25-30 and gets progressively worse. The animations become choppy and often are completely absent (the newly added layers simply appear in their final position). And the pan gestures are either ignored or result in choppy repositioning of the selected layer. I'm supposing that I'm killing the GPU with all of the layers overlapping and another layer animating above? Any suggestions on how to improve performance? Best practices for dealing with large numbers of layers? Is it better to have the layer begin animated in a separate view.layer than the previously added layers? Thanks!

I also get this in the console: Cannot access memory at address 0x1 Cannot access memory at address 0x1 Cannot access memory at address 0x1 Cannot access memory at address 0x1 warning: Cancelling call - objc code on the current thread's stack makes this unsafe.

@TITLE:JSF: bean scope; session vs request
@CONTENT:I have a managed bean called UserSearchHandler, it has a doSearch method that populates UserSearchHandler.searchResults which are displayed in a table on the userSearch.xhtml page. I have another managed bean called UserHandler, it has a showUser method and so on. In the search results table, the user name is a link that, when clicked, is supposed to show user details on a userView.xhtml page. The table and link looks like this: <p:dataTable var="user" value="#{userSearchHandler.searchResults" >

// ... and so on ... then

<h:commandLink value="#{user.firstName}" action="#{userHandler.showUser}">
  <f:setPropertyActionListener target="#{userHandler.userIdToShow}" value="#{profile.id}"/>
</h:commandLink>
 Everything works fine when the managed beans are set to session scope. However, when I change the scope on the beans to request, the search works and the table gets populated, but when I click on the name link nothing happens. I put a break point on the userHandler.showUser method and it never gets hit when the userSearchHandler is set to "request" scope. Can anyone help explain why this is, or what I'm doing wrong?

@LINK:/questions/4744001/determining-template-type-when-accessing-opencv-mat-elements
@TITLE:Determining template type when accessing OpenCV Mat elements
@CONTENT:I'm using the following code to add some noise to an image (straight out of the OpenCV reference, page 449 -- explanation of cv::Mat::begin): void
simulate_noise(Mat const &in, double stddev, Mat &out)
{
    cv::Size s = in.size();
    vector<double> noise = generate_noise(s.width*s.height, stddev);

    typedef cv::Vec<unsigned char, 3> V4;
    cv::MatConstIterator_<V4> in_itr = in.begin<V4>();
    cv::MatConstIterator_<V4> in_end = in.end<V4>();
    cv::MatIterator_<V4> out_itr = out.begin<V4>();
    cv::MatIterator_<V4> out_end = out.end<V4>();

    for (; in_itr != in_end && out_itr != out_end; ++in_itr, ++out_itr)
    {
        int noise_index = my_rand(noise.size());
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
            (*out_itr)[j] = (*in_itr)[j] + noise[noise_index];
    }
}
 Nothing overly complicated: in and out are allocated cv::Mat objects of the same dimensions and type iterate over the input image in at each position, pick a random value from noise (my_rand(int n) returns a random number in [0..n-1] sum the pixel from in with the random noise value put the summation result into out I don't like this code because the following statement seems unavoidable: typedef cv::Vec<unsigned char, 3> V4;
 It has hard-coded two things: The images have 3 channels The channel depth is 8bpp If I get this typedef wrong (e.g. wrong channel depth or wrong number of channels), then my program segfaults. I originally used typedef cv::Vec<unsigned char, 4> V4 to handle images with an arbitrary number of channels (the max OpenCV supports is 4), but this caused a segfault. Is there any way I can avoid hard-coding the two things above? Ideally, I want something that's as generic as: typedef cv::Vec<in.type(), in.size()> V4;
@CODE:cv::Mat::begin void
simulate_noise(Mat const &in, double stddev, Mat &out)
{
    cv::Size s = in.size();
    vector<double> noise = generate_noise(s.width*s.height, stddev);

    typedef cv::Vec<unsigned char, 3> V4;
    cv::MatConstIterator_<V4> in_itr = in.begin<V4>();
    cv::MatConstIterator_<V4> in_end = in.end<V4>();
    cv::MatIterator_<V4> out_itr = out.begin<V4>();

            (*out_itr)[j] = (*in_itr)[j] + noise[noise_index];

@LINK:/questions/4641852/how-to-store-datetimes-in-utc-and-local-timezone
@TITLE:How to store datetimes in UTC and local timezone
@CONTENT:What is a practical way to store datetimes so that I can let users view/query data as of their own local time while keeping information about the original datetime. Basically, users want to be able to query (as of their own local time) data collected from systems in various time zones. But occasionally, they want to know that the data was created at, say, 18:00 in the original system. It helps when users from different parts of the world communicate about the same event. User1: What? We don't have any data for 20:00
User2: Dude, it says 20:00 right there on my screen.
User1: Wait, what timezone are you? What's the UTC-time?
User2: What is UTC? Is that something with computers?
User1: OMFG! *click*
 I'm looking for advice on how to store the data. I'm thinking of storing all datetimes in UTC and adding an additional column containing original timezone name, in a form that lets me use mysql CONVERT_TZ, or the counterpart in Java. The application would then convert dates entered by the user into UTC and I can easily query the database. All dates can also easily be converted to the users local time in the application. Using the original time zone column I also would be able to display the original datetime. However, this means that for each datetime I have, I need an additional column... start_time_utc datetime
start_time_tz  varchar(64)
end_time_utc   datetime
end_time_tz    varchar(64)
 Am I on the right track here? Would anyone who have worked with such data share their experiences? (I will be using MySQL 5.5 CE) Update 1 Data will be delivered in xml files where each entry has a datetime in some local time zone. So there will only be one inserting process, running in one place. Once loaded in the database, it will be presented in some web application to users in different time zones. For the majority of the use cases the data of interest did also originate from the same time zone as the user looking at the data. For some of the more complicated use cases, a series of events are interconnected and span multiple time zones. Hence, users want to be able to talk about the events in order to investigate probable causes/consequences in the other's time. Not UTC, not their own local time.

I have a charting program, and it's design is black, but the charts (that I get from the server as images) are light (it actually uses only 5 colors: red, green, white, black and gray). To fit with the design inversion does a good job, the only problem is that red and green are inverted also (green -> pink, red -> green). Is there a way to invert everything except those 2 colors, or a way to repaint those colors after inversion? And how costly are those operations (since I get the chart updates pretty often)? Thanks in advance :) UPDATE I tried replacing colors with setPixel method in a loop for(int x = 0 ;x < chart.getWidth();x++) {

@CONTENT:The Situation: I would like to ask what's the best logic for synchronizing objects in a multiplayer 1:1 game using BT or a web server. The game has two players, each of them has multiple guns & bullets, the bullets are created dynamically and disappear after a while, the players my move objects around simultaneously. The Problem: I have a real issue with synchronization, since the bullets on one device may be faster than other, also they may have already gone or hit an object on one device while on the other its still in the air. Possibilities? What is the best way of handling synchonization in this case? Should all the objects be controlled by one device acting as the server, while th other just gets the values, positions and does very little thinking. Or should control be distributed where each device creates, destroys and moves its own objects and then through synchronization tells the other device. What is the best to handle transmission delay in this, since BT might be faster than playing over the web? The best would be a working sample - thanks very much!

Straightforward, no 'digging' or voting of any sort, just a chronological flow of responses for each topic message. But with high traffic expected. We would like to flag topic messages according to the response buzz they atract, using a scale of 0 to 10. Been googling for trend algorithms and open source community application examples for a while, and so far have gleaned two interesting references, which I don't fully grok yet: Understanding algorithms for measuring trends, a discussion on comparing wikipedia pageviews using the Baseline Trend Algorithm, here on SO. The Britney Spears Problem, an in-depth article on how to rank search terms, while processing large streams of data. From the first I understand the need to check the slope in activity, and to balance the weight between two items that differ greatly in scale of activity. But how do I compare many items, growing in number quickly across time? And then, how do I break the items within "buzz grades" from 0 to 10? The second reference is fascinating, but over my head at this point. From a first pass I've understood the need to keep memory usage stable while keeping counters and storing references to items if necessary. But I haven't figured a fitting algorithm for my specific use case from it, yet. It's worth noting that I come from a non-computer-science and definitely non-statistics background. Please bear with me :) Any help and code samples (specially in Ruby) would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Drawbacks of static methods in PHP
@CONTENT:In a theoretical database access class, I found that there are quite a few helper functions that I use in the class, which have nothing to do the class's instance (and others, that could be manipulated to be unrelated to the class's instance using dependency injection). For example, I have a function that gets a string between two other strings in a variable. I've been thinking of moving that to a String_Helper class, or something of the sort. This function has already been made static. Also, I have a function that queries a database, query($sql). The connection details are provided by the instance, but I've been considering making it static, and using query($sql, $connection). Developers would then be able to call it statically and not need to instantiate the database class at all. For me, the questions are: Is it worth it to do something like this? Functions like the query function make me wonder if this is not just me trying to make everything as static as possible, without any real need to. Under what circumstances would you consider this useful? I know static functions are harder to test, but if I make sure that their code is completely dependency free (or uses dependency injection where necessary), then they're just as easy to test as everything else, surely? It isn't a concern at the moment, but if, in the future, I decided to extend the classes with the static functions, it would be impossible for me to make the current code use my extended functions. I've thought of Singletons, but the same problem arises: the code would be calling Singleton_Class::getInstance(), and not My_Extended_Singleton_Class::getInstance(). Dependency Injection seems to be the only way to solve this issue, but it might lead to a clunkier API, as every dependency has to be given to an object on __construct(). I have a container class, which holds certain pieces of information statically so that they can be accessed anywhere in the script (global scope). If I can't use static functions or singletons, a class that contained instances of different variables would be great. One could use for example Container::$objects['MyClass'] = $MyClass_object;, and then the rest of the code could just access Container::$objects['MyClass']. If I extended the MyClass class, I could use Container::$objects['MyClass'] = $MyExtendedClass_object;, and the code that used Container::$objects['MyClass'] would use MyExtendedClass, rather than MyClass. This is by far the best way to do it, in my opinion, but I'd like to know what you think about it.
@CODE:query($sql) query($sql, $connection) Singleton_Class::getInstance() My_Extended_Singleton_Class::getInstance() __construct() Container::$objects['MyClass'] = $MyClass_object; Container::$objects['MyClass'] Container::$objects['MyClass'] = $MyExtendedClass_object; Container::$objects['MyClass']

@TITLE:How to access IBOutlets declared in superclass?
@CONTENT:Hey all; I'm currently refactoring a couple of view controllers that share a few IBOutlets and IBAction methods. I moved the outlet declarations and the IBAction method into a superclass, cutting these out of the subclasses. Now, when I open up Interface Builder, I find that I can't see the outlets or actions declared in the superclass. The connections still exist, as I'd wired them up before the refactoring, but they're grayed out. (It's important to note that the connections also WORK, as my action fires on a button press, and my outlets are modified properly.) The question is, how can I get interface builder to recognize outlets from a superclass? Is this possible, and, if not, what do you all recommend? (Just for fun, here's my superclass header file:) @interface TFMainViewController : UIViewController {
    UIImageView *logoImage, *thinkfunImage;
    UIButton *buyFullButton;        
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIImageView *logoImage, *thinkfunImage;

@CONTENT:I am using a map as an associative array of IDs -> value, where the value is a struct defining the object: #include <map>

struct category {

 The above code compiles with g++, but with the following warning: warning: extended initializer lists only available with -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x
 I have read various questions/answers here about struct initialization, but I'm still a bit confused. I have a series of related questions: I could add the compiler option -std=c++0x and be done with the warning, but still be none the wiser about the underlying problem. Wouldn't things break if I add a method to the category struct? What would the best way be to initialize this POD struct (category) in a more C++03 compliant way? Basically, I am not yet sure of the consequences of doing things one way rather than another way. This kind of associative array (where the key is the ID of an object) is easy with PHP, and I'm still learning about the proper way to do it in C++. Is there anything I should pay attention to in the context of the code above? Edit The following questions are related, but I didn't understand the answers when I first read them: C++ initialize anonymous struct c++ Initializing a struct with an array as a member Initializing structs in C++

@TITLE:@Async prevent a thread to continue until other thread have finished
@CONTENT:I have an application where for a certain number of times something needs to be calculated. This calculation function has the annotation @Async (from the Spring Framework), that makes it possible to run these calculations on 4 threads. The problem is that I need about 40000 of these calculations and I want to know the time between the start and end of all the calculations, so I see what time it is before and after the for-loop that calls the calculation functions. But now all the calculations are put in a queue, so the for loop finishes immediately and the time is something like 1 second, while it takes a couple of hours for the calculations to complete. I've tried setting a max queue size to about 100 (also good to reduce memory usage) but this is also no solution since I'll miss the last 100 calculations in the total time it takes. Is there a way to pause the executing code just after the for loop until all threads have finished doing their work, but still being able to use the @Async annotation? This is some code that illustrates the same problem: Executing class: public class Foo {
    public void executeBlaALotOfTimes() {
        long before = System.currentTimeMillis();

        for (int i = 0; i<40000; i++) {
            executeBla();
        }

        long after = System.currentTimeMillis(); 

        System.out.println("Time it took for a lot of bla to execute: " + (after - before) / 1000.0 + " seconds.");
    }
}
 And the class that performs the calculations: @Service
public class Bar {
    @Async
    public void executeBla() {
        System.out.println("Bla!");
    }
}
 This would result in the following output (assuming the code in Foo executes infinitely fast): 
Time it took for a lot of bla to execute: 0.0 seconds.
Bla!
Bla!
Bla!
Bla!

@CONTENT:I'm looking for the best data structure to add styles to a text (say in a text editor). The structure should allow the following operations: Quick lookup of all styles at absolute position X Quick insert of text at any position (styles after that position must be moved). Every position of the text must support an arbitrary number of styles (overlapping). I've considered lists/arrays which contain text ranges but they don't allow quick insert without recalculating the positions of all styles after the insert point. A tree structure with relative offsets supports #2 but the tree will degenerate fast when I add lots of styles to the text. Any other options?

That all works fine and dandy, however it doesn't really give us the ability to any kind of of "staging" QA and every build builds the repo head revision. Ideally we would like Hudson to poll or use post commit hooks build each commit and: checkout locally > run Phing task to run tests and if successful, generates reports etc.. Then be able to manually instantiate an automated deployment (via Phing task) to either "staging QA environment or production from with each specific build. Not every commit will be deployed to QA. Is this work flow even possible from with Hudson, or are we going to need to manually run our deployment Phing tasks after.

I have a very big dictionary with more than 160000 different words, and I want to, given an inicial word w, find all known words at Levenshtein distance at most 2 of w in an efficient way. Of course, having a function which computes all possible edits at edit distance one of a given word and applying it again to each of these edits solves the problem (and in a pretty straightforwad way). The problem is effiency --- given a 7 letter word, this can already take over 1 second to complete, and I need something much more efficient --- if possible, as it is with Levenshtein DFAs, a solution that takes O(|w|) steps. Edit: I know I can construct my own approach to the problem with a little bit of studying, but at the moment I can't afford reading Schulz and Mihov's 60-page-long articles. Thank you very much.

Match making will be handled by the Game Center, but I'll need a game server that will start/manage the games and store the results in a DB. The overall process will be something like... Game Center pairs up two players The player data is sent to the server to initialize a new game The start of the game is synchronized by the server The game starts and each player attempts to solve the puzzle When either player finishes, the server is notified As soon as both players finish, the server responds with the results and the results are stored on the server.

Solution: In a nutshell, the way this works is to create an extra table to keep track of the changes. Each row in the table has a "snapshot" of the data as it existed before the record was changed (or just the data that changed). There are a number of Ruby Gems that have already done most of the work. Here is a list of gems that deal with versioning/revision history. It looks like Paper Trail is currently the most popular gem for doing this. Ryan Bates has recorded a RailsCast providing an overview of using Paper Trail.

@CONTENT:Our customer advertises products but the product's attributes are vastly different from one another. There are almost as many product "classes" as there are products. Originally, we created an EAV database where we added and removed attributes for each "class" of product. The whole thing works very well, but the complexity is mind numbing. This is Database #1. We finally came up with a set of fields common to represent all products (POCOs), moving the "extra" fields to an XML field "catch all". This is Database #2. Now we have some customers using the old and some customers that will use the new. We really didn't want to update the old until we needed to do so, but we have changes from time to time that simply take longer than necessary because of the EAV structure. Questions: Any examples out there on how to code EF to persist POCOs to an EAV databases (where you have a table of field names and a table of data)? Should we just scrap the database and write "normal" tables for all those older customers, given we have changes from time to time? Normal of course is referring to the Boyce Codd Normal Form. We handled the older database by bleeding its structure into the software, then mapping to POCOs in the repository.

This whole thing is compounded when I'm working with the codebehind of a WPF window, which always seem to grow at an exponential rate into one huge mess very quickly. Also: C# has a keyword called partial, which allows you to split a class over any number of files without affecting the functionality. However, I have noticed that Microsoft only seem to use partial to hide generated code from you (Winforms / WPF.)

@TITLE:CSS Sprites with Dynamic Sizing
@CONTENT:I've decided to crate a sprite sheet for my entire site (+-30 images) so I can load 1 image and just reference positions, which reduces image load time and server calls. My question: Is it possible to reference an image in the sprite sheet and then size that image to 100% of its parent container? So For example: #SomeDiv
{
    background: url("/Content/Images/SpriteSheet.png") -125px 0 no-repeat;
    width:100px;
}
 The width of my div is 100px, but the sprite I want to reference is 20px(for example) - how can I streth the extracted sprite to grow to 100px? Regards, Byron Cobb.

@TITLE:Unsync'd Git Repository in Dropbox
@CONTENT:I have a git repository (and working directory) that is stored in my Dropbox so I can move back and forth between computers without having to commit or stash (read: without any effort at all). This is working great except for one minor annoyance that is becoming a major annoyance. Every so often, I'll leave one computer in a fully committed state only to pick up on the other computer and find that a git status reports changes. Inevitably, those changes are related to permissions. What I'm not sure about is why? I assumed that it might be related to how Dropbox writes files on sync'd computers, but the umask on both systems is set to 0002. I would assume that value dictates the mode of files written/updated by Dropbox, but it wouldn't be the first time I'd be wrong. I know I can just tell Git to ignore the file mode, but that's just masking the problem. I'd really like to understand it so I can make an informed decision of how to proceed. Thanks. UPDATE So here's a pretty decent representative example of a repository getting out of sync even though it's entirely contained within Dropbox. As we speak, my personal laptop is reporting a clean working directory for one of my projects: $ git status
# On branch develop
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
 My work laptop, though, reports a number of untracked files. Let me say that again: untracked files. $ git status
# On branch develop
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   html/cake/console/libs/templates/
#   ...4 more files...
#   html/cake/tests/test_app/plugins/test_plugin/views/themed/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
 How can that be? My ~/.gitignore file is also shared across both machines (not that any of these paths are excluded in an ignore file). Is there another component of Git--or maybe Dropbox--that could be in play here?
@CODE:git status umask $ git status
# On branch develop
nothing to commit (working directory clean) $ git status
# On branch develop
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

@TITLE:Rails 3, how add a associated record after creating a primary record (Books, Auto Add BookCharacter)
@CONTENT:Rails newbie... trying to understand the right way to do things... In my app users can create a Book ( I have that working) What I want to happen is when a user creates a book, a record is added to the BookCharacters Table, something like (id, book.id, user.id, characterdescription.string.) When the book is created, the user who created it should automatically be added as the first BookCharacter. After than the user can then manually add/edit as many BookCharacters as they want. But initially I want them added automatically by default. So in my Book controller I have: def create
 @book = Book.new(params[:book])
 respond_to do |format|
  if @book.save
....
 With Rails, is it the practice to add that kind of logic after the book is saved? Something like Book.create( :creator => current_user.id)
 I appreciate the help
@CODE:def create
 @book = Book.new(params[:book])

@CONTENT:I have an override OnException(ExceptionContext filterContext) in my base controller to catch the app during any errors, and then log them. The problem I'm getting in my app is this particular method is fired off four times for certain errors. I'll walk you through a scenario: Let's say i navigate to: http://localhost:180/someController/someAction?someId=XX And I have poor object handling in my code. The Id passed in is an invalid one, and it retrieves some null object, I then, bc of my bad object handling, try to operate on a null object. I get an exception. BaseController's OnException is fired off here. That null object is still returned out to the view, where the view tries to bind it to something, or what have you. BaseController's OnException is fired off here again, for the error in the view. Essentially, only one error is important to me, but the trickle up effect is causing more errors to fire off, and spam my inbox :-/. What is the correct way to catch an error in MVC2 and not have this happen to me?

@TITLE:RoR Achievement System - Polymorphic Association & Design Issues
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to design an achievement system in Ruby on Rails and have run into a snag with my design/code. Attempting to use polymorphic associations: class Achievement < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :achievable, :polymorphic => true
end

class WeightAchievement < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :achievement, :as => :achievable
end
 Migrations: class CreateAchievements < ActiveRecord::Migration
... #code
    create_table :achievements do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description
      t.references :achievable, :polymorphic => true

      t.timestamps
    end

     create_table :weight_achievements do |t|
      t.integer :weight_required
      t.references :exercises, :null => false

      t.timestamps
    end
 ... #code
end
 Then, when I try this following throw-away unit test, it fails because it says that the achievement is null. test "parent achievement exists" do
   weightAchievement = WeightAchievement.find(1)
   achievement = weightAchievement.achievement 

    assert_not_nil achievement
    assert_equal 500, weightAchievement.weight_required
    assert_equal achievement.name, "Brick House Baby!"
    assert_equal achievement.description, "Squat 500 lbs"
  end
 And my fixtures: achievements.yml... BrickHouse:
 id: 1
 name: Brick House
 description: Squat 500 lbs
 achievable: BrickHouseCriteria (WeightAchievement)
 weight_achievements.ym...  BrickHouseCriteria:
     id: 1
     weight_required: 500
     exercises_id: 1
 Even though, I can't get this to run, maybe in the grand scheme of things, it's a bad design issue. What I'm attempting to do is have a single table with all the achievements and their base information (name and description). Using that table and polymorphic associations, I want to link to other tables that will contain the criteria for completing that achievement, e.g. the WeightAchievement table will have the weight required and exercise id. Then, a user's progress will be stored in a UserProgress model, where it links to the actual Achievement (as opposed to WeightAchievement). The reason I need the criteria in separate tables is because the criteria will vary wildly between different types of achievements and will be added dynamically afterwards, which is why I'm not creating a separate model for each achievement. Does this even make sense? Should I just merge the Achievement table with the specific type of achievement like WeightAchievement (so the table is name, description, weight_required, exercise_id), then when a user queries the achievements, in my code I simply search all the achievements? (e.g. WeightAchievement, EnduranceAchievement, RepAchievement, etc)
@CODE:class Achievement < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :achievable, :polymorphic => true
end

class WeightAchievement < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :achievement, :as => :achievable
end class CreateAchievements < ActiveRecord::Migration
... #code

    end

     create_table :weight_achievements do |t|
      t.integer :weight_required
      t.references :exercises, :null => false

      t.timestamps
    end
 ... #code
end test "parent achievement exists" do
   weightAchievement = WeightAchievement.find(1)
   achievement = weightAchievement.achievement 

    assert_not_nil achievement
    assert_equal 500, weightAchievement.weight_required
    assert_equal achievement.name, "Brick House Baby!"
    assert_equal achievement.description, "Squat 500 lbs"

I compared (1) multiple 'replace' method, (2) the regular expression method, and (3) Matt Anderson's method. With n=10 runs, the results came up as follows: On 100 characters:

TIME: 2 ms [ matts_multi_replace_method(list, str) ]
 On 10000 characters: 
TIME: 3 ms [ replace_method(str) ]
TIME: 7 ms [ regular_expression_method(str, dict) ]
TIME: 5 ms [ matts_multi_replace_method(list, str) ]

@LINK:/questions/3332574/best-way-to-test-high-volume-smtp-email-sending-code
@TITLE:Best way to test high-volume SMTP email sending code?
@CONTENT:I've written a component in a Windows service (C#) which is responsible for sending sometimes large volumes of emails. These emails will go to recipients on many domains ¡V really, any domain. (Yes, the recipients want the email. No, I'm not spamming. Yes, I'm in complaince with CAN-SPAM. Yes, I'm aware sending email from code sucks.) Many of the emails are transactional (generated in response to user actions); some are bulk (mail-merges basically). I do not want to rely on an external SMTP server. (Among other considerations, the thought of having to check a mailbox for bounce messages and trying to parse them gives me bad feelings.) My design is fairly simple. Both the transactional and bulk messages are generated and inserted into a DB table. This table contains the email envelope and content, plus an attempt count and retry-after date. The service runs a few worker threads which grab 20 rows at a time and loop through each. Using the Simple DNS Plus library, I grab the MX record(s) of the recipient's domain and then use System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient to synchronously send the email. If the call to Send() succeeds, I can dequeue the email. If it temporarily fails, I can increment the attempt count and set an appropriate retry-after date. If it permanently fails, I can dequeue and handle the failure. Obviously, sending thousands of test emails to hundreds of different actual domains is a Very Bad Idea. However, I definitely need to stress-test my multi-threaded send code. I'm also not quite sure what the best way is to simulate the various failure modes of SMTP. Plus, I want to make sure I get past the various spam control methods (graylisting to name the most relevant to the network layer of things). Even my small-scale testing difficulties are exacerbated by my recent discovery of my ISP blocking connections to port 25 on any server other than my ISP's SMTP server. (In production, this thing will of course be on a proper server where port 25 isn't blocked. That does not help me test from my dev machine.) So, the two things I'm most curious about: How should I go about testing my code? What are the various ways that SmtpClient.Send() can fail? Six exceptions are listed; SmtpException and SmtpFailedRecipientsException seem to be the most relevant. Update: Marc B's answer points out that I'm basically creating my own SMTP server. He makes the valid point that I'm reinventing the wheel, so here's my rationale for not using an 'actual' one (Postfix, etc) instead: Emails have different send priorities (though this is unrelated to the envelope's X-Priority). Bulk email is low priority; transactional is high. (And any email or group of emails can be further configured to have an arbitrary priority.) I need to be able to suspend the sending of lower-priority emails so higher-priority emails can be delivered first. (To accomplish this, the worker threads simply pick up the highest priority items from the queue each time they get another 20.) If I've already submitted several thousand bulk items to an external SMTP server, I have no way of putting those on hold while the items I wish to submit now get sent. A cursory Google search shows Postfix doesn't really support priorities; Sendmail prioritizes on information in the envelope, which does not meet my needs. I need to be able to display the progress of the send process of a blast (group of bulk emails) to my users. If I've simply handed all of my emails off to an external server, I have no idea how far along in actual delivery it is. I'm hesitant to parse bounce messages because each MTA's bounce message is different. Sendmail's is different from Exchange's is different from [...]. Also, at what frequency do I check my bounce inbox? What if a bounce message itself isn't delivered? I'm not too terribly concerned with a blast failing half-way through. If we're talking catastrophic failure (app-terminating unhandled exception, power failure, whatever): Since the worker threads dequeue each email from the database when it is successfully delivered, I can know who has received the blast and who hasn't. Further, when the service resets after a failure, it simply picks up where it left off in the queue. If we're talking local failure (a SmtpException, DNS failure, or so forth): I just log the failure, increment the email's attempt counter, and try again later. (Which is basically what the SMTP spec calls for.) After n attempts, I can permanently fail the message (dequeue it) and log the failure for examination later. This way, I can find weird edge cases that my code isn't handling ¡V even if my code isn't 100% perfect the first time. (And let's be honest, it won't be.) I'm hoping the roll-my-own route will ultimately allow me to get emails out faster than if I had to rely on an external SMTP server. I'd have to worry about rate-limiting if the server weren't under my control; even if it were, it's still a bottleneck. The multithreaded architecture I've gone with means I'm connecting to multiple remote servers in parallel, decreasing the total amount of time it takes to deliver n messages.

@CONTENT:I'm looking for clever ways to build dynamic Java classes, that is classes where you can add/remove fields at runtime. Usage scenario: I have an editor where users should be able to add fields to the model at runtime or maybe even create the whole model at runtime. Some design goals: Type safe without casts if possible for custom code that works on the dynamic fields (that code would come from plugins which extend the model in unforeseen ways). Good performance (can you beat HashMap? Maybe use an array and assign indexes to the fields during setup?) Field "reuse" (i.e. if you use the same type of field in several places, it should be possible to define it once and then reuse it). Calculated fields which depend on the value of other fields Signals should be sent when fields change value (no necessarily via the Beans API) "Automatic" parent child relations (when you add a child to a parent, then the parent pointer in the child should be set for "free"). Easy to understand Easy to use Note that this is a "think outside the circle" question. I'll post an example below to get you in the mood :-)

Besides that, is there any performance issue if i use more stored procedures? I am worried as i have close to 50 stored procedures in my project. How they differ conceptually. Thanks in advance! EDITED:- When i executed a calculation in stored procedure and in functions, i have found that in stored procedures it is taking 0.15 sec, while in function it takes 0.45sec. Surprisingly functions are taking more time than stored procedures. May be functions are worth for its reusability. Inline functions executes quicker than strored procedures. I think, this is because multi-select functions can't use statastics, which slows them down, but inline table-value functions can use statistics.

@CONTENT:as the world cup is the main sport event and the Vuvuzelas are the most annoying sound in the world, I had an idea to remove them definitively by reading this new ( http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2010-06/simple-software-can-filter-out-vuvuzela-whine) that told us that the sound has some frequencies at 233Hz + 466,932,1864Hz. I have already made a lot of Android application by myself but never touching the signal analysis and filtering part, so here are a few questions, I do not ask for precise answer but maybe links and tutorial to find something to work on. I guess that a new Android phone has the CPU and power to make real-time filtering. 1) How can I intercept the sound coming from the Jack microphone - Line-IN plug- ( I plan to link my TV to my phone with Jack to Jack plug). My question is totally software and coding, I have all the wires and adapters to plug a jack into my android phone Line IN. 2) Are there some Fourier analysis librairies, may I have a look to Java libraries on the web and import them to my Android project? I really apologize because my question seem not precise, but I think that would be something great. Thank you for your answers.

@TITLE:How can I change the VisualState in a View from the ViewModel?
@CONTENT:I'm new to WPF and MVVM. I think this is a simple question. My ViewModel is performing an asynch call to obtain data for a DataGrid which is bound to an ObservableCollection in the ViewModel. When the data is loaded, I set the proper ViewModel property and the DataGrid displays the data with no problem. However, I want to introduce a visual cue for the user that the data is loading. So, using Blend, I added this to my markup:         <VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
        <VisualStateGroup x:Name="LoadingStateGroup">
            <VisualState x:Name="HistoryLoading">
                <Storyboard>
                    <ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Visibility)" Storyboard.TargetName="HistoryGrid">
                        <DiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime="0" Value="{x:Static Visibility.Hidden}"/>
                    </ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames>
                </Storyboard>
            </VisualState>
            <VisualState x:Name="HistoryLoaded">
                <Storyboard>
                    <ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Visibility)" Storyboard.TargetName="WorkingStackPanel">
                        <DiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime="0" Value="{x:Static Visibility.Hidden}"/>
                    </ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames>
                </Storyboard>
            </VisualState>
        </VisualStateGroup>
    </VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
 I think I know how to change the state in my code-behind (something similar to this): VisualStateManager.GoToElementState(LayoutRoot, "HistoryLoaded", true);
 However, the place where I want to do this is in the I/O completion method of my ViewModel which does not have a reference to it's corresponding View. How would I accomplish this using the MVVM pattern?
@CODE:<VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
        <VisualStateGroup x:Name="LoadingStateGroup">
            <VisualState x:Name="HistoryLoading">
                <Storyboard>
                    <ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Visibility)" Storyboard.TargetName="HistoryGrid">
                        <DiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime="0" Value="{x:Static Visibility.Hidden}"/>
                    </ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames>
                </Storyboard>
            </VisualState>
            <VisualState x:Name="HistoryLoaded">
                <Storyboard>
                    <ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.Visibility)" Storyboard.TargetName="WorkingStackPanel">
                        <DiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime="0" Value="{x:Static Visibility.Hidden}"/>
                    </ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames>
                </Storyboard>
            </VisualState>
        </VisualStateGroup>
    </VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups> VisualStateManager.GoToElementState(LayoutRoot, "HistoryLoaded", true);

@LINK:/questions/3002656/a-custom-auto-sizing-wpf-panel-class
@TITLE:A custom auto-sizing WPF Panel class
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a custom Panel class for WPF, by overriding MeasureOverride and ArrangeOverride but, while it's mostly working I'm experiencing one strange problem I can't explain. In particular, after I call Arrange on my child items in ArrangeOverride after figuring out what their sizes should be, they aren't sizing to the size I give to them, and appear to be sizing to the size passed to their Measure method inside MeasureOverride. Am I missing something in how this system is supposed to work? My understanding is that calling Measure simply causes the child to evaluate its DesiredSize based on the supplied availableSize, and shouldn't affect its actual final size. Here is my full code (the Panel, btw, is intended to arrange children in the most space-efficient manner, giving less space to rows that don't need it and splitting remaining space up evenly among the rest--it currently only supports vertical orientation but I plan on adding horizontal once I get it working properly): Edit: Thanks for the responses. I will examine them more closely in a moment. However let me clarify how my intended algorithm works since I didn't explain that. First of all, the best way to think of what I'm doing is to imagine a Grid with each row set to *. This divides the space up evenly. However, in some cases the element in a row may not need all that space; if this is the case, I want to take any leftover space and give it to those rows that could use the space. If no rows need any extra space, I just try to space things evenly (that's what extraSpace is doing, it's only for that case). I do this in two passes. The ultimate point of the first pass is to determine the final "normal size" of a row--i.e. the size of the rows that will be shrunk (given a size smaller than its desired size). I do this by stepping through smallest item to biggest and adjusting the calculated normal size at each step, by adding the leftover space from each small item to each subsequent larger item until no more items "fit" and then break. In the next pass I use this normal value to determine if an item can fit or not, simply by taking the Min of the normal size with the item's desired size. (I also changed the anonymous method to a lambda function for simplicity.) Edit 2: My algorithm seems to work great at determining the proper size of the children. However, the children just aren't accepting their given size. I tried Goblin's suggested MeasureOverride by passing PositiveInfinity and returning Size(0,0), but this causes the children to draw themselves as though there are no space constraints at all. The part that's not obvious about this is that it's happening because of a call to Measure. Microsoft's documentation on this subject is not at all clear, as I've read over each class and property description several times. However, it's now clear that calling Measure does in fact affect the rendering of the child, so I will attempt to split the logic up among the two functions as BladeWise suggested. Solved!! I got it working. As I suspected, I needed to call Measure() twice on each child (once to evaluate DesiredSize and a second to give each child its proper height). It seems odd to me that layout in WPF would be designed in such an odd way, where it's split up into two passes, but the Measure pass actually does two things: measures and sizes children and the Arrange pass does next to nothing besides actually physically position the children. Very bizarre. I'll post the working code at the bottom. First, the original (broken) code: protected override Size MeasureOverride( Size availableSize ) {
    foreach ( UIElement child in Children )
        child.Measure( availableSize );

    return availableSize;
}

protected override System.Windows.Size ArrangeOverride( System.Windows.Size finalSize ) {
    double extraSpace = 0.0;
    var sortedChildren = Children.Cast<UIElement>().OrderBy<UIElement, double>( child=>child.DesiredSize.Height; );
    double remainingSpace = finalSize.Height;
    double normalSpace = 0.0;
    int remainingChildren = Children.Count;
    foreach ( UIElement child in sortedChildren ) {
        normalSpace = remainingSpace / remainingChildren;
        if ( child.DesiredSize.Height < normalSpace ) // if == there would be no point continuing as there would be no remaining space
            remainingSpace -= child.DesiredSize.Height;
        else {
            remainingSpace = 0;
            break;
        }
        remainingChildren--;
    }

    // this is only for cases where every child item fits (i.e. the above loop terminates normally):
    extraSpace = remainingSpace / Children.Count;
    double offset = 0.0;

    foreach ( UIElement child in Children ) {
        //child.Measure( new Size( finalSize.Width, normalSpace ) );
        double value = Math.Min( child.DesiredSize.Height, normalSpace ) + extraSpace;
            child.Arrange( new Rect( 0, offset, finalSize.Width, value ) );
        offset += value;
    }

    return finalSize;
}
 And here's the working code: double _normalSpace = 0.0;
double _extraSpace = 0.0;

protected override Size MeasureOverride( Size availableSize ) {
    // first pass to evaluate DesiredSize given available size:
    foreach ( UIElement child in Children )
        child.Measure( availableSize );

    // now determine the "normal" size:
    var sortedChildren = Children.Cast<UIElement>().OrderBy<UIElement, double>( child => child.DesiredSize.Height );
    double remainingSpace = availableSize.Height;
    int remainingChildren = Children.Count;
    foreach ( UIElement child in sortedChildren ) {
        _normalSpace = remainingSpace / remainingChildren;
        if ( child.DesiredSize.Height < _normalSpace ) // if == there would be no point continuing as there would be no remaining space
            remainingSpace -= child.DesiredSize.Height;
        else {
            remainingSpace = 0;
            break;
        }
        remainingChildren--;
    }
    // there will be extra space if every child fits and the above loop terminates normally:
    _extraSpace = remainingSpace / Children.Count; // divide the remaining space up evenly among all children

    // second pass to give each child its proper available size:
    foreach ( UIElement child in Children )
        child.Measure( new Size( availableSize.Width, _normalSpace ) );

    return availableSize;
}

protected override System.Windows.Size ArrangeOverride( System.Windows.Size finalSize ) {
    double offset = 0.0;

    foreach ( UIElement child in Children ) {
        double value = Math.Min( child.DesiredSize.Height, _normalSpace ) + _extraSpace;
        child.Arrange( new Rect( 0, offset, finalSize.Width, value ) );
        offset += value;
    }

    return finalSize;
}
 It may not be super-efficient what with having to call Measure twice (and iterating Children three times), but it works. Any optimizations to the algorithm would be appreciated.

@TITLE:How to configure database connection securely
@CONTENT:Similar but not the same: How to securely store database connection details Securely connecting to database within a application Hi all, I have a C# WinForms application connecting to a database server. The database connection string, including a generic user/pass, is placed in a NHibernate configuration file, which lies in the same directory as the exe file. Now I have this issue: The user that runs the application should not get to know the username/password of the general database user because I don't want him to rummage around in the database directly. Alternatively I could hardcode the connection string, which is bad because the administrator must be able to change it if the database is moved or if he wants to switch between dev/test/prod environments. So long I've found three possibilities: The first referenced question was generally answered by making the file only readable for the user that runs the application. But that's not not enough in my case (the user running the application is a person. The database user/pass are general and shouldn't even be accessible by the person.) The first answer additionally proposed to encrypt the connection data before writing it to the file. With this approach, the administrator is not able anymore to configure the connection string because he cannot encrypt it by hand. The second referenced question provides an approach for this very scenario but it seems very complicated. My questions to you: This is a very general issue, so isn't there any general "how-to-do-it" way, somehow a "design pattern"? Is there some support in .NET's config infrastructure? (optional, maybe out of scope) Can I combine that easily with the NHibernate configuration mechanism? Update: In response to the first answers: There are several reasons why I would want to connect to the database directly and not use a web service: (N)Hibernate can only be used with a database, not webservices (am I right?) We plan to provide offline capability, i.e. if the database or network should be down, the user can continue his work. To manage this, I'm thinking of having a local, in-proc database, e.g. SQL Server Compact, and using MS Sync framework to synchronize it with the server database as soon as it is up again. Do you have any further ideas taking this into account?

@TITLE:Rails: Multi-Step New User Signup Form (FSM?)
@CONTENT:I've read the "Create Multi-Step Wizard" in Advanced Rails Recipes. I've also read and re-read the documentation for the updated FSM I'm using called Workflow, and looked here and here. The Advanced Rails Recipe focuses on records (quizzes) that already exist, and doesn't cover creating new ones. The Workflow docs don't cover any code for controllers or views, so I've no idea what to do with all this model magic, and the last two links barely touch on implementation either. From the aforementioned resources, I have a good understanding of what a FSM in Rails is and how to play with it in the console or IRB, but I've got very little direction or understanding how to implement one into my Rails app. What I would like is this: a simple, multi-step user signup process. Step 1: User enters in their critical details (with validations). Step 2: User enters in their search criteria, for their profile (with validations). Step 3: User agrees to the Terms of Service (with validations). Step 4: User is greeted by a confirmation page, including a link that takes them to their newly created account. I'd also like full navigation between the steps and full capture (saves to the database) with each transition. Can someone please give me a clear implementation of something similar to this? I would LOVE an example app that includes a multi-step signup process where I can look at the code (FULL source code--models AND controllers and views) under the hood, but I've been unable to find anything like that. Any guidance would be appreciated! EDIT: Please help make this a Railscast! Ryan B. (a.k.a.

@TITLE:Finding pixels that make an image unique within a list, can you improve on brute force?
@CONTENT:Suppose I have a list of strings where each string is exactly 4 characters long and unique within the list. For each of these strings I want to identify the position of the characters within the string that make the string unique. So for a list of three strings abcd
abcc
bbcb
 For the first string I want to identify the character in 4th position d since d does not appear in the 4th position in any other string. For the second string I want to identify the character in 4th position c. For the third string it I want to identify the character in 1st position b AND the character in 4th position, also b. This could be concisely represented as abcd -> ...d
abcc -> ...c
bbcb -> b..b
 If you consider the same problem but with a list of binary numbers 0101
0011
1111
 Then the result I want would be 0101 -> ..0.
0011 -> .0..
1111 -> 1...
 Staying with the binary theme I can use XOR to identify which bits are unique within two binary numbers since 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110
 which I can interpret as meaning that in this case the 2nd and 3rd bits (reading left to right) are unique between these two binary numbers. This technique might be a red herring unless somehow it can be extended to the larger list. A brute-force approach would be to look at each string in turn, and for each string to iterate through vertical slices of the remainder of the strings in the list. So for the list abcd
abcc
bbcb
 I would start with abcd
 and iterate through vertical slices of abcc
bbcb
 where these vertical slices would be a | b | c | c
b | b | c | b
 or in list form, "ab", "bb", "cc", "cb". This would result in four comparisons a : ab -> . (a is not unique)
b : bb -> . (b is not unique)
c : cc -> . (c is not unique)
d : cb -> d (d is unique)
 or concisely abcd -> ...d
 Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I have a feeling that there should be an elegant and general solution that would apply to an arbitrarily large list of strings (or binary numbers). But if there is I haven't yet been able to see it. I hope to use this algorithm to to derive minimal signatures from a collection of unique images (bitmaps) in order to efficiently identify those images at a future time. If future efficiency wasn't a concern I would use a simple hash of each image. Can you improve on brute force? Edit The approach I'm warming to is building a map of pixels to images sprawl[Tuple<x=10, y=33,color=f1fefd>] => {
     image17,
     image23,
     ...
}

sprawl[Tuple<x=10, y=34,color=f1fef0>] => {
     image11
     ...
}
 and then using that map to identify the minimal set of signature pixels for each image. If a pixel (identified by x, y, color) references just one image then I have found a perfect (minimal) signature for that image. It's more complicated if an image has no unique pixels, but since I know all images are unique within the list I should be able to combine two or more pixel references (but as few as possible) to deduce the image. Update I've been working on an algorithm for this. My problem is very similar to this one, and I've written up my algorithm as an answer to that question. This update is to flag the attention of anyone still following (I see five bookmarks). I'm working on this in isolation so any and all feedback is welcome, even if just to observe that I haven't made myself clear!
@CODE:abcd
abcc
bbcb abcd -> ...d
abcc -> ...c
bbcb -> b..b 0101
0011
1111 0101 -> ..0.
0011 -> .0..
1111 -> 1... 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 abcd
abcc
bbcb abcd abcc
bbcb a | b | c | c
b | b | c | b a : ab -> . (a is not unique)
b : bb -> . (b is not unique)
c : cc -> . (c is not unique)
d : cb -> d (d is unique) abcd -> ...d sprawl[Tuple<x=10, y=33,color=f1fefd>] => {

For instance, if the text contained: Maybe if you tell me a little more about who Mr Jones is, that would help. It would also be useful if I could have a description of his appearance, or even better a photograph? It'd be great to be able to detect that the person has asked for a photograph of Mr Jones. I could take a really na?ve approach and just look for the word "photo" or "photograph", but this would obviously be no good if they wrote something like: Please, never send me a photo of Mr Jones. Does anyone know where to start with this? Is it even possible?

But I don't exactly know how to change it, so please give some suggestions about it... Here is our current setup: 2 webservers 1 database server 1 test server Current deployment adaptation We develop and work on the test server, every changes is uploaded manually to the test server. When a change or feature is complete, we then commit the changes to SVN repository. After committing the changes, we then upload our changes to the first webserver, where there will be a cronjob running every minute to sync the files between the servers. Something very annoying is, whenever we upload a file just as the syncing job starts, the file that is sync-ed will appear corrupted, since it is only half-uploaded. Another thing is whenever there is a deployment fault, it will be extremely difficult to revert. These are basically the problem I'm facing, what should I do? In addition, since there are files on the 1st webserver which needs to be sync-ed to the other servers anytime, so the cronjob was there for the reason. P/S: I'm sorry I forgot to mention that, the SVN server is hosted. We don't have too much control over it, but I believe I can edit hooks...

@TITLE:Quartz 2D or OpenGL ES? Pros and cons in the long term, possibility of migration to other platforms
@CONTENT:I'm having a hard time deciding whether to go with Quartz2D or OpenGL for an iPad game. It will be 2D mostly, but effect-intense (simultaneous lighting effects for 10-30 objects, 10-20 simultaneous animations on the screen). So far, assuming i'm equally dumb in both technologies and have to learn them from the ground, i came to this list. (I've read several topics here, on SO, with names like "Quartz or OpenGL", but i'm still left with some questions) Quartz: Better time-to-market, because of ready to use absractions like UIView, UIImageView, CoreAnimation abstractions Open GL ES Closer to hardware, thus, performance is better. App, implemented with OpenGL ES can be easier migrated to Android, MeeGo, Windows Phone, etc. My questions are: How time will it take to rewrite Quartz 2d app to use OpenGL? Lets say it took me 2 man-month to write Quartz app, how much time will i need to rewrite it? (Please, just some subjective opinions, i'll try to summarize them somehow) Regarding the ease of migration to other platforms, when using OpenGL, is it really so? Or efforts when migrating Quartz app from iPhoneOS to Android will be not so much bigger, compared to OpenGL app migration? (Ease of migration is quite important criterion) Regarding OpenGL, should i go with OpenGL 1.1 or 2.0, concerning migration? (Android supports 2.0 through NDK, but dont know whether NDK's use will increase or decrease migration efforts)

@TITLE:Making mercurial subrepositories behave like subversion externals
@CONTENT:The FAQ, and hginit.com have been really useful for helping me make the transition from svn to hg. However, when it comes to using Hg's subrepository feature in the manner of subversion's externals, I've tried everythign and cannot replicate the nice behavior of svn externals. Here's the simplest example of what I want to do: Init "lib" repository This repository is never to be used as a standalone; it's always included by main repositories, as a sub-repository. Init one or more including repositories To keep the example simple, I'll "init" a repository called "main" Have "main" include "lib" as a subrepository Importantly -- AND HERE'S WHAT I CAN'T GET TO WORK: When I modify a file inside of "main/lib", and I push the modification, then that change gets pushed to the "lib" repository -- NOT to a copy inside of "main". Command lines speak louder than words. I've tried so many variations on this theme, but here's the gist. If someone can reply, in command lines, I'll be forever grateful! 1. Init "lib" repository $ cd /home/moi/hgrepos ## Where I'm storing my hg repositories, on my main server $ hg init lib $ echo "foo" > lib/lib.txt $ hg add lib $ hg ci -A -m "Init lib" lib 2. Init "main" repository, and include "lib" as a subrepos $ cd /home/moi/hgrepos $ hg init main $ echo "foo" > main/main.txt $ hg add main $ cd main $ hg clone ../lib lib $ echo "lib=lib" > .hgsub $ hg ci -A -m "Init main" . This all works fine, but when I make a clone of the "main" repository, and make local modifications to files in "main/lib", and push them, the changes get pushed to "main/lib", NOT to "lib". IN COMMAND-LINE-ESE, THIS IS THE PROBLEM: $ /home/moi/hg-test $ hg clone ssh://moi@www.moi.com/hgrepos/lib lib $ hg clone ssh://moi@www.moi.com/hgrepos/main main $ cd main $ echo foo >> lib/lib.txt $ hg st M lib.txt $ hg com -m "Modified lib.txt, from inside the main repos" lib.txt $ hg push pushing to ssh://moi@www.moi.com/hgrepos/main/lib That last line of output from hg shows the problem. It shows that I've made a modification to a COPY of a file in lib, NOT to a file in the lib repository. If this were working as I'd like it to work, the push would be to hgrepos/lib, NOT to hgrepos/main/lib. I.e., I would see: $ hg push pushing to ssh://moi@www.moi.com/hgrepos/lib IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS IN TERMS OF COMMAND LINES RATHER THAN IN ENGLISH, I WILL BE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL! Thank you in advance!

Is there a way to specify a single authentication scheme on a per-service level in the web.config? I thought this might be as straight forward as making a change to <system.serviceModel> but... it turns out that WCF Data Services do not configure themselves in the web config.

@TITLE:Distributing VC++ Redist¡K running installer when already installed causes problems
@CONTENT:Using the Inno installer, we distribute the VC++ redistributable with our app so we can run it automatically. We've found that running it on a system where it's already installed asks us to repair/undo the installation which is going to totally confuse users. Is there a way around this? Maybe a flag on the installer or something? Thanks.

@TITLE:Testing ASP.NET webforms applications
@CONTENT:If you're in my position you have a big WebForms applications which have escalated to this unmaintainable thing. Things break when you add new features and you need an inexpensive maintainable way to do some kind of automated testing. Now, from my understanding, the right thing to do would be to try building an abstraction layout of the page and user control model present in ASP.NET WebForms however, seeing as it would require a major investment in an existing application it is not an option. I'm trying and pushing for a REST-like development as much as possible because it has some nice properties. And while doing this I've written a simple spider bot that crawls all URLs it can find and tries, simply getting them. This allowed my to quickly find bad data that was causing problems and avoid having my end-users clicking on broken things, however, this is of course not enough. I continued work on my crawler and it's developed into a simple REST client that tries different input combination, looking for a probable bug or crash. It's more intelligent that just an exhaustive search (because it knows about the ASP.NET WebForms application layer) and my goal here is to basically explore the state of the web application, hoping to hit all the corner cases before our users. Does anyone have any experience doing something similar? Also, for you test gurus out there. Is this a complete waste of time, or will I be able to actually say something about the quality here? From my perspective it seems to hit a sweet spot in that it will try things a potential end user would though a browser. As I said before, we're stuck in a bad place. And we need a simple way out of it, right now. We've tried things like Selenium, but it mandates a lot of extra work and we change things all the time, it's just no possible to maintain multiple selenium test suits for 50 different applications.

@TITLE:asp.net MVC Solution/Project layouts
@CONTENT:This is more of an open question rather than looking for one specific answer. As we all know there is no one answer that fits all solutions but I am curious to find out how you structure you asp.net MVC solutions and any pitfalls you may have come across in your design or things that you would do differently if you could start again. The standard asp.net MVC template is just a basic template and I'm sure I've read/heard in a podcast that Scott Hanselman stated the only reason the Model folder is there is so people didn't ask where's the model. This already implies that maybe it should be moved to its own separate class. Personally in the small MVC apps I've done I've separated out the model into its only class that holds the model and the repository while the 'MVC' project has the controller and the views. This has generally workout without any issues but as I said these have only been small apps. So what are most people doing? - Just using the standard template? - Separating out just the model? - Separating out the model and the controller? - Separating out even move so all the data access is done through web services or some sort of data portal? - Or something totally different? Finally how are people creating unit tests? Just one unit test class that test each of the projects or a unit test class for each project?

@LINK:/questions/2247402/implementing-a-multidock-window-system-like-blend-visual-studio-in-wpf
@TITLE:Implementing a multidock window system (like blend, visual studio) in WPF
@CONTENT:How would you go about to implement a docking toolbox windowing system as seen in Expression Blend where you can dock toolbox windows in a lot of ways beneat each other, overlapping as tabs or as floating top level windows. My system should behave pretty much the same as in Expression Blend. Also the way I get visual cues where the toolbox window would dock when dragging is exactly what I need. There is just one exeception: In blend when dragging onto a toolbox window that is already top level (torn off) I can only dock it as a tab filling the whole window. I however need a system where there is no difference between a toolbox window and the main window. I need to be able to dock the windows beneath each other in a toolbox window just as in the main window. Also note that due to an internal policy I can not use any open source or 3rd party library for this. I'd be interested in how you would setup the general class design for something like this? I would like to stay as generic as possible so it can be used for lot of different scenarios. The dockeing behavior is as in the following picture. The center image shows the sensetive drag docking region. And the outer images where the window would snap: Generally I am facing to mayor problems here: How do I design the programming model (how are the docking configurations to be persisted in XAML) and how do I acutally implement the underlying functionality. My first tought would be that I'd like to habe a symbiosis of a DockPanel and a TabControl. Something in the lines of this: <DockTabControl>
  <DockTabItem Dock="FirstLeft">
    <DockTabItem.Header>
        <TextBlock>Tab 1</TextBlock>
    </DockTabItem.Header>
    <!-- Tab 1 content -->
  </DockTabItem>
  <DockTabItem Header="Tab 2" Dock="SecondLeft" DockMode="MergeWithPreviousToTabgroup">
    <!-- Tab 2 content -->
  </DockTabItem>
  <DockTabItem Header="Tab 3" Dock="FirstMiddle">
    <!-- Tab 3 content -->
  </DockTabItem>
</DockTabControl>
 Of course this doesn't make sense yet. Docking can't be defined that way and the windowing problem is not adressed here yet. But I like the idea of defining the docking and the tabgroups just by defining some properties on the DockTabItem. I really wouldn't want to introduce extra controls like TabGroups or similar. I like how the docking behavior in the DockPanel just by defining the order of the children and the Dock attached property. Of course my docking will be a bit more complex and behaves more like what the Grid does.
@CODE:<DockTabControl>
  <DockTabItem Dock="FirstLeft">
    <DockTabItem.Header>
        <TextBlock>Tab 1</TextBlock>
    </DockTabItem.Header>

  </DockTabItem>

@CODE:subset(data, data[2] == "Company Name 09" | "Company Name", drop = T) subset(data, data[[2]] == grep("Company Name", data[[2]]))

I don't see any example via Flurry themselves, and though I've seen code samples of custom exception reporters, I haven't seen a simple example of how to implement the basic error reporting just using Flurry.

@TITLE:Problems wih minSdkVersion 1.5
@CONTENT:we have a problem related to the manifest file and the property "android:minSdkVersion". The issue is: If our platform is 2.0 and we use the property "android:minSdkVersion=3" (3 = sdk 1.5) the graphics get corrupted (In details, the application's resolution get reduced to a 2/3 part of the original size, this is, when the resolution should be 480x720, it becomes in a 320x480). This is happening on the Android emulator, and on the devices Droid/Milestone (Which are platforms 2.0). When we switch the property to "android:minSdkVersion=4" (4 = sdk 1.6) the problem gets solved, but when we want to put that version on platform 1.5, Android doesn't allow us to install it. It would help us to know any conflict regarding graphics within the 2.0 sdk, or any known problem around the "android:minSdkVersion" in the manifest. Thanks!

@TITLE:Can't force Rails into production environment via Passenger/Nginx
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble getting a Rails app to run in the production environment via Phusion Passenger on Nginx/Ubuntu. According to the docs, the environment is controlled by the rails_env option in nginx.conf ... but it runs in development mode on our box regardless of whether we specify 'rails_env production;' or leave it out (the default is said to be production). Other notes: The Linux environment variable RAILS_ENV is also set to production. We can run in production mode using 'script/server -e production', so it doesn't seem to be a case of Ruby code overriding the environment. Any ideas? Full nginx.conf: worker_processes  1;

@CONTENT:Based on ideas presented in link I implemented several different "sleep methods". One of this methods was the "binary sleep", which looks like this: while (System.currentTimeMillis() < nextTimeStamp)
{
sleepTime -= (sleepTime / 2);
sleep(sleepTime);
}
 Because the check if the next time step is already reached takes place at the beginning I, would expect that the method is running too long. But the cummulative distribution of the simulation error (expected time - real time) looks like this: Does somebody has an idea why I'm getting this results? Maybe the method System.currentTimeMillis() does not really return the current time? BR, Markus @irreputable When I made the evaluation I also created a bell curve by using a german statistic program. Because it was not possible to change caption, here is the english translation of all relevant items: H?ufigkeit = frequency Fehler = error Mittelwert = average Std-Abw = standard deviation

 I should mention that it works with a playbin and SDP file. For example this file: v=0

s=Session streamed by GStreamer
i=server.sh
t=0 0

a=type:broadcast
m=video 4444 RTP/AVP 96
c=IN IP4 127.0.0.1
a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000
 Can be used to play the stream like this: gst-launch -vvv playbin uri=file://`pwd`/stream.sdp
 For completeness: I am using VLC to send data. This is the command: vlc -I rc /usr/local/movies/sample.mp4 \
    --screen-fps=10 :screen-caching=100 \
    --sout='#transcode{vcodec=h264,venc=x264{bframes=0,keyint=40},vb=512}:\
                   rtp{mux=ts,dst=127.0.0.1,port=4444}'
 Would someone help me understand why the gst-launch script fails? The error "reason not-linked" makes me think that the link between gstrtpbin and the rtph264depay elements is broken. But I don't know how to fix it. Edit Following RAOF's suggestions I fixed a few errors in my command. However I am using ffdec_h264 and autovideosink because on my Windows system I don't have the fluh264dec and xvimage sink plugins installed: gst-launch-0.10 udpsrc port=4444 caps="application/x-rtp,media=(string)video,clock-rate=(int)90000,encoding-name=(string)H264" ! .recv_rtp_sink_0 gstrtpbin ! rtpmp2tdepay ! mpegtsdemux ! ffdec_h264 ! autovideosink

 I'm still trying to figure out how to fix this. If you can help, then feel free to do so. Edit2 I tested again using the SDP solution and observed that the "non-existing PPS" errors also occur, but the video does play. On the other hand, the fatal "internal data flow error" only shows when using the custom pipeline solution. I suspect that the "non-existing PPS" errors are caused by the x264 encoder. The "internal data flow error" must be caused by an error in my pipeline, or perhaps a bug in some Windows plugin. I'll so some further research...

@TITLE:Developing a website for 3 mln. users: SharePoint OR pure ASP.NET?
@CONTENT:We need to develop quite a powerful web application for an investment bank. The bank IT would like us to build it on top of the SharePoint platform, but we would prefer to do pure ASP.NET programming. The web-app should have the following characteristics. 1) It will be a site for bank's clients that will allow them to view their stock portfolios, get miscellaneous reports with graphs and charts, etc. 2) The web-app will also allow clients to send orders to the bank to buy stocks and perform other financial operations. 3) The number of users will be approximately 3 000 000 (total) and 20 000 at any one time. We have never made any SharePoint programming, but as far as I know, SharePoint is primarily designed to create intranet sites for colleagues to communicate with each other and work more efficiently, to maintain a document library, etc. However, the bank IT told us that SharePoint has in fact lots of other features that will help us make the project more efficiently - for example, it seems that SharePoint has some built-in scalability and high availability technologies. I heard saying that SharePoint development is very tedious, that the platform cannot be very easily customized, etc. The question is: is it better to create our web-app on pure ASP.NET and deal with scalability and other issues ourselves, or base it on SharePoint - taking into account that the web-app we need to create is non-standard and complex? Thank you, Mikhail. UPDATE In the answers, someone suggested using ASP.NET MVC. My another question is: should we use "classic" ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC for such project (if we leave out the SharePoint option)?

}
 The Flex app receives the data as an ArrayCollection of AS3 Object instances - i.e. not as a ArrayCollection of Folders which is what I want. I've annotated my Flex class as follows: package myproject.vo {
    import com.adobe.cairngorm.vo.IValueObject;

 I checked that I had getters/setters on my Java Folder class to match the properties in my Flex Folder class. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Java Drag and Drop on Mac OS X
@CONTENT:I am making a Java program, and one way to load files is to drag the file onto the application window (swing). I have code that works in Windows and Linux. It works in OS X, but the 1st file I drag throws an exception, and then the rest work fine. Here is the code I use to enable DnD. /*

        // Select best data flavor
        DataFlavor flavor = DataFlavor.selectBestTextFlavor(flavors);

        // Flavor will be null on Windows
        // In which case use the 1st available flavor
        flavor = (flavor == null) ? flavors[0] : flavor;

        // Flavors to check
        DataFlavor Linux = new DataFlavor("text/uri-list;class=java.io.Reader");
        DataFlavor Windows = DataFlavor.javaFileListFlavor;

            // Remove 'file://' from file name
            String fileName = read.readLine().substring(7).replace("%20"," ");
            // Remove 'localhost' from OS X file names
            if(fileName.substring(0,9).equals("localhost")) {
                fileName = fileName.substring(9);
            }
            read.close();

            dtde.dropComplete(true);

                System.out.println("File Dragged: " + list.get(0));
                mainWindow.openFile(list.get(0).toString());

    }
}
 For some reason, OS X throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on this line: flavor = (flavor == null) ? flavors[0] : flavor;
 After that exception is thrown, if I drag another file onto the window, it works. Why does it throw an exception? NOTE: mainWindow.openFile() is a function that opens a file. It takes a string parameter (the file name), and the program opens that file. NOTE 2: This is on OS X 10.6.2 (Snow Leopard).

@TITLE:Dynamic Foreign Keys - How To Implement?
@CONTENT:I have 4 tables (appointed, class, elected, status) that I want to cross reference into a single table's (members) column. The values of the of 4 tables are time sensitive based off a history table (members_history). The desired result is that the query should output all members and the current appointed position or current elected position, class, and status within the members row and include additional information obtained from the foreign rows. So instead of just returning: id, username, password, salt, name_first, name_last, date_join & date_leave; The query would return id, username, password, salt, name_prefix, name_first, name_last, hours_extra, date_join, date_leave, appointed, class, elected & status; Wherever an added column does not have a current value in history it's result should be NULL. Now I think I can do this with sub-querys, but have been so far banging my head against the keyboard.

@LINK:/questions/1645962/django-year-month-based-posts-archive
@TITLE:Django Year/Month based posts archive
@CONTENT:i'm new to Django and started an application, i did the models, views, templates, but i want to add some kind of archive to the bottom of the page, something like this http://www.flickr.com/photos/ionutgabriel/3990015411/. So i want to list all years and next to them all the months from that year. The months who have posts to be links and other no. Also i want to translate the months names cause i need them in romanian. What i've done so far is: in my view: def archive(request): 
    arch = Post.objects.dates('date', 'month', order='DESC') 

    archives = {} 
    for i in arch: 
        tp = i.timetuple() 
        year = tp[0] 
        month = tp[1] 
        if year not in archives: 
            archives[year] = [] 
            archives[year].append(month) 
        else: 
            if month not in archives[year]: 
                archives[year].append(month) 
    return render_to_response('blog/arhiva.html', {'archives':archives}) 
 and in my template:     {% for years, months in archives.items %} 
                    {{ years }} 
                    {% for month in months %} 
                   <a href="{{ years }}/{{ month }}">{{ month }}</a> 
                    {% endfor %} 
            <br /> 
                {% endfor %} 
 this returns something like:        2008               10 
       2009               10               9 
       2007               10 
 but i can't sort them at all...by year or by anything, and also i don't know how to add all months(the names), i want them like this:    2009 Ian Feb Mar Apr Mai Iun Iul Aug Sept Oct Noi Dec       
   2008 Ian Feb Mar Apr Mai Iun Iul Aug Sept Oct Noi Dec
   2007 Ian Feb Mar Apr Mai Iun Iul Aug Sept Oct Noi Dec
 with link on the months who have entries. Thank you for your help! p.s. sorry for my English LE: Maybe i put the question in a wrong way, i know how to obtain dates, but i don't know how to format them to look like these:    2009 Ian Feb Mar Apr Mai Iun Iul Aug Sept Oct Noi Dec       
   2008 Ian Feb Mar Apr Mai Iun Iul Aug Sept Oct Noi Dec
   2007 Ian Feb Mar Apr Mai Iun Iul Aug Sept Oct Noi Dec
 all i can get from arch = Post.objects.dates('date', 'month', order='DESC') with {{ archives }} in template is something like: [datetime.datetime(2009, 10, 1, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2009, 9, 1, 0, 0),
 datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2007, 10, 1, 0, 0)]
 then i've tried a loop: {% for archive in archives %}

{{ archive }} <br />

{% endfor %}
 and got: 2009-10-01 00:00:00 
2009-09-01 00:00:00 
2008-10-01 00:00:00 
2007-10-01 00:00:00 
 After that tried something like this: {% for archive in archives %}

{{ archive|date:"Y: m" }} <br />

{% endfor %}
 and got: 2009: 10 
2009: 09 
2008: 10 
2007: 10 
 Here i'm stuck and don't know how to format the data so i can get distinct years with all the months and only the months who have entries to be links... Any ideas? Thank you in advance!

@TITLE:Repository pattern with Linq to SQL using IoC, Dependency Injection, Unit of Work
@CONTENT:There seems to be lots of examples on implementing Repository pattern for Linq to SQL. Most of them featuring IRepository and DI; Some have implemented Unit of Work and some not. I tried to read as most of the results returned by searches on SO and Google on Linq to SQL repository patterns. Nevertheless I've not come across a complete solution yet. From my readings I've implemented a repository pattern as shown below: I'm using DI to register interfaces on which the repositories are depended: this.container.RegisterType<IConnectionStringFactory, ConnectionStringFactory>(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager(),
    new InjectionConstructor(connectionString));
this.container.RegisterType<IDataContextFactory, DataContextFactory>();
 Implementation of Repository pattern: public interface IPrivilegeRepository : IRepository<PrivilegesEntity>
{
   IList<MenuModel> GetRootMenu();
   IList<MenuModel> GetChildMenu(int parentId);
}

public class PrivilegeRepository : Repository<PrivilegesEntity>, IPrivilegeRepository
{
    #region IPrivilegeRepository Members

    public IList<MenuModel> GetRootMenu()
    {
        return FindAll(menu => menu.ParentId == null)
            .OrderBy(menu => menu.SortOrder)
            .Select(c => EntityMapper.Privileges.ToBusinessObject(c))
            .ToList();
    }

    public IList<MenuModel> GetChildMenu(int parentId)
    {
        return FindAll(menu => menu.ParentId == parentId)

 Repository class is implemented as below with implementations of IRepository (not shown) and is having a dependency on IDataContextFactory which DI is taking care of: public class Repository<T> : IRepository<T> where T : class
{
    public Repository(IDataContextFactory dataContextFactory)
    {
        this.dataContextFactory = dataContextFactory;
    }
}
 Repositories are consumed using IoC: PrivilegeRepository repository = container.Resolve<PrivilegeRepository>();
 I'm returning result of queries as a collection of Business Object in order to avoid dependency on Linq to SQL on application layers where I consume repository. The above scenario works fine with my WPF application which is using MVVM pattern. I have ViewModel aks Presenter classes which are not depended of classes generated by Linq-SQL. How do I extend this pattern so that I can save data to the Database. I'd like to pass Business Objects back to the repository and get them saved. Is it possible? How can I implement Unit of Work in such a scenario.

@LINK:/questions/1541510/is-this-lock-free-net-queue-thread-safe
@TITLE:Is this lock-free .NET queue thread safe?
@CONTENT:My question is, is the class included below for a single-reader single-writer queue class thread-safe? This kind of queue is called lock-free, even if it will block if the queue is filled. The data structure was inspired by Marc Gravell's implementation of a blocking queue here at StackOverflow. The point of the structure is to allow a single thread to write data to the buffer, and another thread to read data. All of this needs to happen as quickly as possible. A similar data structure is described in an article at DDJ by Herb Sutter, except the implementation is in C++. Another difference is that I use a vanilla linked list, I use a linked list of arrays. Rather than just including a snippet of code I include the whole thing with comment with a permissive open source license (MIT License 1.0) in case anyone finds it useful, and wants to use it (as-is or modified). This is related to other questions asked on Stack Overflow of how to create a blocking concurrent queues (see Creating a blockinq Queue in .NET and Thread-safe blocking queue implementation in .NET). Here is the code: using System;

@CONTENT:I'm looking for implementations of set reconciliation algorithm. The problem is following: there are two sets with elements identified by some relatively compact value (e.g. UUID or MD5/SHA1/whatever hash) sitting on different machines. These sets differ in relatively few elements and I want to synchronize these sets while transferring minimal amount of data. Most of googling leads here. This is GPL'd implementation of what seems to be the state-of-art approach to the task. The problem is that I can't use GPL'd code in my app. Most likely I'll have to reimplement it myself using something like nzmath, but maybe there are other implementations (preferably Python or C/C++), or maybe there are other nicer algorithms?

 The other thing that you're missing is the WindowsImpersonationCredentials class. public class WindowsImpersonationCredentials : IReportServerCredentials
{
    public bool GetFormsCredentials(out Cookie authCookie, out string userName, out string password, out string authority)
    {
        authCookie = null;

        return false;
    }

    public WindowsIdentity ImpersonationUser
    {

 Other things you may need to know... This is running on an intranet, and impersonation is turned on. Logging indicates that the impersonation user is being set correctly. This does work when running in Visual Studio (http://localhost:devport), and it does work when running on my development box (http://localhost/myApplication). It does not work when running on our test or production servers. I have tried solutions both with and without system.net.defaultProxy settings in web.config. Neither worked. What am I doing wrong? Is it a server setting? Is it code? Is it web.config?

@CONTENT:I have a standard self referencing table of Categories. In my entity model I have made associations Children and Parent. Is it possible to load the whole Category object without lazy loading? if I use the code below, it loads only to the second level. db.Categories.MergeOption = System.Data.Objects.MergeOption.NoTracking;

 Is it possible to load references if I have all the category objects already loaded? One method to load it is to add the Children property multiple times db.Categories.Include("Children.Children.Children.Children.Children")

@LINK:/questions/1412391/what-character-replacements-should-be-performed-to-make-base-64-encoding-url-saf
@TITLE:What character replacements should be performed to make base 64 encoding URL safe?
@CONTENT:In looking at URL safe base 64 encoding, I've found it to be a very non-standard thing. Despite the copious number of built in functions that PHP has, there isn't one for URL safe base 64 encoding. On the manual page for base64_encode(), most of the comments suggest using that function, wrapped with strtr(): function base64_url_encode($input)
{
     return strtr(base64_encode($input), '+/=', '-_,');
}
 The only Perl module I could find in this area is MIME::Base64::URLSafe (source), which performs the following replacement internally: sub encode ($) {
    my $data = encode_base64($_[0], '');
    $data =~ tr|+/=|\-_|d;
    return $data;
}
 Unlike the PHP function above, this Perl version drops the '=' (equals) character entirely, rather than replacing it with ',' (comma) as PHP does. Equals is a padding character, so the Perl module replaces them as needed upon decode, but this difference makes the two implementations incompatible. Finally, the Python function urlsafe_b64encode(s) keeps the '=' padding around, prompting someone to put up this function to remove the padding which shows prominently in Google results for 'python base64 url safe': from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode, urlsafe_b64decode

def uri_b64encode(s):
    return urlsafe_b64encode(s).strip('=')

def uri_b64decode(s):
    return urlsafe_b64decode(s + '=' * (4 - len(s) % 4))
 The desire here is to have a string that can be included in a URL without further encoding, hence the ditching or translation of the characters '+', '/', and '='. Since there isn't a defined standard, what is the right way?
@CODE:base64_encode() strtr() function base64_url_encode($input)
{
     return strtr(base64_encode($input), '+/=', '-_,');
} sub encode ($) {
    my $data = encode_base64($_[0], '');
    $data =~ tr|+/=|\-_|d;
    return $data;
} from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode, urlsafe_b64decode

def uri_b64encode(s):
    return urlsafe_b64encode(s).strip('=')

@TITLE:NSData to NSString converstion problem!
@CONTENT:I'm getting an html file as NSData and need to parse it to extract some info. My approach was to convert it to NSString with UTF8 encoding (the html has non english characters, russian for example) - it failed. I used something like that: NSString *respData = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:[theData bytes]];
 but it returned nil. The only thing that actually worked was [NSString stringWithCString:[theData bytes] length:[theData length]];
 but when it encounters russian characters for example it returns jibrish. Then my next approach was to parse the byte array of the data, extract the bytes I need and somehow convert them to NSString. I tried something like that: -(NSString *)UTF8StringFromData:(NSData *)theData{
 Byte *arr = [theData bytes];
 NSUInteger begin1 = [self findIndexOf:@"<li>" bArr:arr size:[theData length]]+4;
 NSUInteger end1 = [self findIndexOf:@"</li></ol>" bArr:arr size:[theData length]];
 Byte *arr1 = (Byte *)malloc(sizeof(Byte)*((end1-begin1+1)));
 int j = 0;
 for (int i = begin1; i < end1; i++){
  arr1[j] = arr[i];
  j++;

Rather, what I'm trying to ask is if you come to a point where you need https anywhere on your site whether it be login or payments, why not make all communication to the site over http? As an example, assume a blog site. Now, the blog posts might get created by sending an email. Further down the line, I might provide a 'login' and then an 'add post' action. In this scenario usually the https is used only for the login and then again regular http for actually adding the post. Since, now the need is to provide an 'admin' mode, so to speak, why not have all communication over https while a person is in the 'admin' mode, i.e. logged in.

@TITLE:What is the best way to merge two objects during runtime using C#?
@CONTENT:I have two objects and I want to merge them: public class Foo
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Bar
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public string Property2 { get; set; }

 To create: public class FooBar
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public string Property2 { get; set; }
    public string Property3 { get; set; }
    public string Property4 { get; set; }
}
 I will only know the structure of Foo at runtime. Bar can be any type at runtime. I would like to have a method that will be given a type and it combine that type with Foo. For instance, the scenario above, the method was given a Bar type at runtime and I combined it with Foo. What would be the best way to do this? Can it be done using LINQ Expressions or do I have to generate it Dynamically or is there another way? I am still learning the new LINQ namespace in C# 3.0, so excuse the ignorance if it can't be done using LINQ Expressions. This is also the first time I have ever had to do something dynamic like this with C#, so I am not quite sure of all the options I have available to me. Thanks for any options given. EDIT This is strictly for adding meta information to the type given to me for serialization. This scenario keeps the user's objects ignorant of the meta information that needs to be added, before it is serialized. I have come up with two options before asking this question and I just wanted to see if there was anymore, before deciding on which one to use. The two options I have come up with are: Manipulating the serialized string of the type given to me after serializing it, by adding the meta information. Wrapping the type given to me, which is similar to what @Zxpro mentioned, but mine differed slightly, which is fine. It will just make the user of my API have to follow the convention, which isn't a bad thing, since everybody is about convention over configuration: public class Foo<T>
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public T Content { get; set; }
}
 EDIT Thanks everybody for their answers. I decided on wrapping the object like above and I gave the answer to @Zxpro, since a majority liked that approach also. If anybody else comes across this question, feel free to post, if you think there might be a better way.

    public string Name { get; set; }

You can't index the full words because you don't have enough resources. Edit: in addition to the file optimization approach mentioned below, are there any database optimization?

@TITLE:Access App.Config Settings from Class Library Called through Unit Test Project
@CONTENT:I have the following setup: ASP.net 3.5 Web Site Project C# Class Library with business logic C# Class Library for unit testing The business logic library does all of the db access. It gets connection strings from the web.config file of the web site by accessing System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings. When the library is called by the web site, this works fine, as the library looks for the config of the caller. I want to be able to test my business logic through the unit testing class library. I have put an App.config file in the root of the testing class library. From what I read, when the testing library calls data access procedures that are part of the business logic library, the connection settings from the App.config file of the testing library should be accessed and used. However, when I try to run my unit tests, I am getting errors back that indicate that the testing library's App.config file (and/or its contents) is not being accessed successfully. My retrieval of the config properties (from within the business logic library) looks like this: public SqlConnection MainConnection {
  get {
    string conn = "";
    try {
      conn = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["connString"].ConnectionString;
    } catch {
      // might be calling from test project. Need to reference app settings
      conn = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["connString"];
    }
    return new SqlConnection(conn);
  }
}
 When this is called from the website project, it works. From within the unit test, the conn variable is never set to anything (I have also tried System.Configuration.ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings, and using instead of with the same result). What do I need to do to make the business logic class library successfully retrieve the unit test class libraries settings, when called from within the NUnit GUI?

  get {
    string conn = "";
    try {
      conn = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["connString"].ConnectionString;

@TITLE:How to do Obj-C Categories in Python?
@CONTENT:Obj-C (which I have not used for a long time) has something called categories to extend classes. Declaring a category with new methods and compiling it into your program, all instances of the class suddenly have the new methods. Python has mixin possibilities, which I use, but mixins must be used from the bottom of the program: the class has to declare it itself. Foreseen category use-case: Say you have a big class hierarchy that describe different ways of interacting with data, declaring polymorphic ways to get at different attributes. Now a category can help the consumer of these describing classes by implementing a convenient interface to access these methods in one place. (A category method could for example, try two different methods and return the first defined (non-None) return value.) Any way to do this in Python? Illustrative code I hope this clarifies what I mean. The point is that the Category is like an aggregate interface, that the consumer of AppObj can change in its code. class AppObj (object):
  """This is the top of a big hierarchy of subclasses that describe different data"""
  def get_resource_name(self):
    pass
  def get_resource_location(self):

And it works great; I'm quite pleased with how well it works normally. By normally I mean when I invoke it directly through the Python interpreter, like this: > python myapp.py
 However, I wanted to go a step further and actually compile this into a standalone executable file. So I followed these instructions from the wxPython wiki which utilize py2exe. At first it gave me errors in the command line, saying MSVCR90.dll was missing. Then I copied MSVCR90.dll to my Python\DLLs folder. That looked at first like it fixed it, since it successfully did what it needed to do. It did finish with a quick warning that there were some DLL files the program depends on and I may or may not need to distribute them. So I navigated into the dist folder that py2exe had created and tried running my executable. But trying to open it only popped up an error dialog that said: This application failed to start because MSVCR90.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
 So I went ahead and copied MSVCR90.dll again into this dist folder. But that didn't do the trick. Then I copied it into the WINDOWS\system32 directory. That didn't do it either. What do I need to do to get this thing to work?

For example: http://maps.google.com/?q=loc:+Maryland+Ave+at+e.+26th+st+Baltimore+MD+US&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=A&layer=c&cbll=39.319313,-76.618426&panoid=6W2XgkHoGuf6_SKv0LIL9Q&cbp=12,307.06,,0,3.16 As you move the cursor over the building it "hugs" the walls. It's not just as simple as following the intersection because if you continue on to the left you can see the angle change as it hits different faces of the buildings. Do they do some sort of image analysis to identify faces of the buildings or do they, as they take the picture, do some sort of laser range finder and then later combine it with the picture?

@TITLE:Smart JVM and JIT Micro-Optimizations
@CONTENT:Over time, Sun's JVM and JIT have gotten pretty smart. Things that used to be common knowledge as being a necessary micro-optimization are no longer needed, because it gets taken care of for you. For example, it used to be the case that you should mark all possible classes as final, so the JVM inlines as much code as possible. However now, the JIT knows whether your class is final based on what classes get loaded in at runtime, and if you load a class to make the original one non-final-able, it un-inlines the methods and un-marks it as final. What other smart micro-optimizations does the JVM or JIT do for you? EDIT: I made this a community wiki; I'd like to collect these over time. I am really surprised more people are not interested in this.

@CONTENT:I have a container class, we'll call it template <class T> CVector { ... }
 I want to do something different with this class when T is a pointer type, e.g. something along the lines of: template <class T*> CVector< SomeWrapperClass<T> >;
 where SomeWrapperClass is expecting the type of the pointed to thing as its parameter. Unfortunately, this syntax doesn't quite work and with some digging, I haven't found a good way to get something like this working. Why do it this way? I want to change, in a very large app, how some of our containers work when the type they're specialized on is a pointer vs. not a pointer - and ideally, i'd like to do it without changing the ~1,000 places in the code where there are things like CVector<Object*> vs CVector<int> or some such - and playing games with partial specializations seemed to be the way to go. Am I on crack here?

@TITLE:Initializing template base-class member types in derived-class initializer lists
@CONTENT:Here is some code outlining a problem I've been wrestling with. The final problem (as far as g++ is concerned at the moment) is that: "error: 'Foo-T' was not declared in this scope" when performing the Bar::Bar(...) constructor routine. Otherwise, the problem I'm attempting to learn my way through is one of setting base-class member types based on arguments passed to a derived-class constructor using templates. If there were a way to set the base-class member type (T Foo-T) simply by passing arguments to the derived-class constructor, I would prefer that. As of now I can't see a way past using both the template argument and a matching derived-class constructor argument to accomplish this task. Can you spot anything in the following code that I can be doing better to achieve the same goals? I'm rather new to generic-coding and templates. #include <iostream>

@TITLE:Using Java and any external libraries, how can I draw latitude/longitude points onto a graphical representation of the Earth?
@CONTENT:I'm currently using the Java Map Projection Library (I was able to obtain the code used for the Applet from the author and modify it for use in a desktop application - not sure if he linked to that on his website yet) to draw a map of the Earth in an application. However, I want to take this a step further. I have a set of latitude/longitude points that I want to plot on this map - I just need to draw a circle at each point and perhaps some lines connecting the circles (points) on the map. However, as the user uses the built-in panning and zooming capabilities, the points need to be redrawn in the proper position. The best I have been able to achieve is maintaining the points when zooming, and even then the points get larger as you zoom in. I'm totally open to switching libraries, however I really haven't found a library that can take care of drawing a world map, particularly onto a Swing component (it doesn't need to be that accurate, just show the various landmasses somewhat correctly) and also plotting additional points on top of that map and having them "stick" to various latitude/longitude coordinates. I have looked at Google Earth and NASA WorldWind, however they are awfully heavy for my purposes (I don't need anything that detailed or accurate) and it doesn't seem that easy to allow for offline use and integrate the world image view into an existing application. Suggestions or thoughts?

@TITLE:Correct Structure to check for Errors using NSError
@CONTENT:I'm coding up various routines and I'm trying my best to keep it neat and refactored. Methods I'm creating are starting to look similar to this code: -(IBAction)buttonPress:(id)sender {
    // Create Document Shopping List with this document
    [self doSomething:&error];

    if(error) {
        [NSApp presentError:&error];
        return nil;
    }

    [self doSomethingElse:&error];

    if(error) {

    [self doYetSomethingElse:&error];

    if(error) {
        [NSApp presentError:&error];
        return nil;
    }
}
 I love NSError, but this seems like an awfully clumsy way of handling all my errors. A few thoughts I've had about alternative ways: a) the error checking could be built into the methods doSomething, doSomethingElse etc, but then I wouldn't be able to exit the button press method without doing some kind of checking on the return value, which would lead me back to a similar structure. b) I could set up the NSError as being Key Value Observed, but something about this feels deeply wrong. I'm very aware of the possibilities of abuse with KVO, so I'm trying to do everything without it whereever possible. Surely I'm missing something really basic here? Is there a pattern that can help me? Or is this structure OK?
@CODE:-(IBAction)buttonPress:(id)sender {
    // Create Document Shopping List with this document
    [self doSomething:&error];

    if(error) {

@CONTENT:UPDATED After more reading, the solution can be given with the following recurrence relation: (a) When i = 1 and j = 2, l(i; j) = dist(pi; pj )
(b) When i < j - 1; l(i; j) = l(i; j - 1) + dist(pj-1; pj)
(c) When i = j - 1 and j > 2, min 1<=k<i (l(k; i) + dist(pk; pj ))
 This is now starting to make sense, except for part C. How would I go about determining the minimum value k? I suppose it means you can iterate through all possible k values and just store the minimum result of ( l(k,i) + dist(pk,pj)? Yes, definitely a problem I was studying at school. We are studying bitonic tours for the traveling salesman problem. Anyway, say I have 5 vertices {0,1,2,3,4}. I know my first step is to sort these in order of increasing x-coordinates. From there, I am a bit confused on how this would be done with dynamic programming. I am reading that I should scan the list of sorted nodes, and maintain optimal paths for both parts (initial path and the return path). I am confused as to how I will calculate these optimal paths. For instance, how will I know if I should include a given node in the initial path or the return path, since it cannot be in both (except for the endpoints). Thinking back to Fibonacci in dynamic programming, you basically start with your base case and work your way forward. I guess what I am asking is how would I get started with the bitonic traveling salesman problem? For something like the Fibonacci numbers, a dynamic programming approached is quite clear. However, I don't know if I am just being dense or what but I am quite confused trying to wrap my head around this problem. Thanks for looking! NOTE: I am not looking for complete solutions, but at least some good tips to get my started. For example, if this were the Fibonacci problem, one could illustrate how the first few numbers are calculated. Please let me know how I can improve the question as well.

@TITLE:Entity Framework - Linq To Entities - Many-To-Many Query Problems
@CONTENT:I am having problems querying many-to-many relationships in Linq To Entities. I am basically trying to replicate this query using Linq: Select * 
FROM Customer 
LEFT JOIN CustomerInterest ON Customer.CustomerID = CustomerInterest.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN Interest ON CustomerInterest.InterestID = Interest.InterestID
WHERE Interest.InterestName = 'Football'
 I have looked around the net and not really found any suitable examples of how to do this. The closest I have got is: List<Customer> _Customers = (from _LCustomers in _CRM.Customer.Include("CustomerInterest.Interest")
                                  where _LCustomers.CustomerInterest.Any(x => x.Interest.InterestName == "Football")
                                  select _LCustomers).ToList();
 The problem with this is that if a customer has more than one interest and one of them is "Football" then all of them are returned. I have also looked at All() which has the inverse problem, i.e. will only return if they have one interest and it is football, if they have two and one of them isn't football nothing is returned. Anyone got any ideas?
@CODE:Select * 
FROM Customer 
LEFT JOIN CustomerInterest ON Customer.CustomerID = CustomerInterest.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN Interest ON CustomerInterest.InterestID = Interest.InterestID
WHERE Interest.InterestName = 'Football' List<Customer> _Customers = (from _LCustomers in _CRM.Customer.Include("CustomerInterest.Interest")

                                  select _LCustomers).ToList();

 OnSessionCreated just posts a message to a window whenever a session is created for the time being; which never happens. Just in case my assumptions are totally off base, I'm expecting a notification whenever an application that has yet to play audio starts to do so; so launching VLC with a video file should immediately result in a notice, while visiting Pandora via a web browser would also trigger such a notice. Debugging shows all returned values are S_OK. My COM experience is pretty limitted, so pointing out general "WTFs?" would also be appreciated.

@TITLE:Web front end caching best practices for site?
@CONTENT:Summary As I'm looking on stackoverflow and around the net, I find that there is a general lack of good documentation on best practices for caching a high performance site that uses sessions. It would be helpful if we can share some ideas around some basic building blocks particularly around caching. For the purpose of this discussion, I'm avoiding memcache and focusing on the caching of static and pages that are fully generated. So to set up the scenario, imagine a web server (say nginx), reverse proxy (say varnish), app server (whatever), db server (say mysql). Anonymous Static items (gif/jpg etc.) Semi dynamic (js/css) Dynamic Logged In Static Semi dynamic (js/css) Dynamic Generally speaking, all of the Anon should be cacheable and most of Logged In (ignore dynamic, no ESI for now). Anon #1 Set far-off Expires Set ETag if possible Cache-Control: max-age=315360000 Anon #2 (have the reverse proxy cache the result if dynamically generated else Anon #1 rules apply) Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3000 Anon #3 Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300 Logged In #1 Set far-off Expires Set ETag if possible Cache-Control: max-age=315360000 Logged In #2 (have the reverse proxy cache the result if dynamically generated else Logged In #1 rules apply) Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3000 Logged In #3 Cache-Control: s-maxage=0, must-revalidate What are your suggestions?

@CONTENT:The idea behind this question is to understand the deeper concepts of using union and using it in different way so as to save memory.. My question to all is-- let's say there is a structure struct strt

 and the same structure represented in union union unin
{
   float f;
   char c;

 If I allocate values to structure members one after another and then print them, it gets printed. But in case of union it doesn't happen, some overwriting is being done.. So I need to find out a method which can store the values of f,c,a using union and then I can print the same. (Apply any operations or anything..) but I am in search of this technique.. Can anybody out there guide me or give me any idea?

@LINK:/questions/709084/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-an-iterator-and-an-iterable
@TITLE:How to tell the difference between an iterator and an iterable?
@CONTENT:In Python the interface of an iterable is a subset of the iterator interface. This has the advantage that in many cases they can be treated in the same way. However, there is an important semantic difference between the two, since for an iterable __iter__ returns a new iterator object and not just self. How can I test that an iterable is really an iterable and not an iterator? Conceptually I understand iterables to be collections, while an iterator only manages the iteration (i.e. keeps track of the position) but is not a collection itself. The difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple times. If an iterator is given then the second loop will not work since the iterator was already used up and directly raises StopIteration. It is tempting to test for a next method, but this seems dangerous and somehow wrong. Should I just check that the second loop was empty? Is there any way to do such a test in a more pythonic way? I know that this sound like a classic case of LBYL against EAFP, so maybe I should just give up? Or am I missing something? Edit: S.Lott says in his answer below that this is primarily a problem of wanting to do multiple passes over the iterator, and that one should not do this in the first place. However, in my case the data is very large and depending on the situation has to be passed over multiple times for data processing (there is absolutely no way around this). The iterable is also provided by the user, and for situations where a single pass is enough it will work with an iterator (e.g. created by a generator for simplicity). But it would be nice to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are needed. Edit 2: Actually this is a very nice Example for Abstract Base Classes. The __iter__ methods in an iterator and an iterable have the same name but are sematically different! So hasattr is useless, but isinstance provides a clean solution.

@TITLE:Django ORM: caching and manipulating ForeignKey objects
@CONTENT:Consider the following skeleton of a models.py for a space conquest game: class Fleet(models.Model):
    game = models.ForeignKey(Game, related_name='planet_set')
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='planet_set', null=True, blank=True)
    home = models.ForeignKey(Planet, related_name='departing_fleet_set')

class Planet(models.Model):

    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='planet_set', null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    ships = models.IntegerField()
 I have many such data models for a project I'm working on, and I change the state of the game based on somewhat complicated interactions between various data objects. I want to avoid lots of unnecessary calls to the database, so once per turn, I do something like Query all the fleets, planets, and other objects from the database and cache them as python objects Process the game objects, resolving the state of the game Save them back in the database This model seems to totally break down when using ForeignKey objects. For example, when a new fleet departs a planet, I have a line that looks something like this: fleet.home.ships -= fleet.ships
 After this line runs, I have other code that alters the number of ships at each of the planets, including the planet fleet.home. Unfortunately, the changes made in the above line are not reflected in the QuerySet of planets that I obtained earlier, so that when I save all the planets at the end of the turn, the changes to fleet.home's ships get overwritten. Is there some better way of handling this situation? Or is this just how all ORMs are?

    game = models.ForeignKey(Game, related_name='planet_set')

@TITLE:Mocking a HttpContext Response.Output with Moq
@CONTENT:I've been using the MvcMockHelpers class found at Hanselman's blog for passing in a mocked HttpContext. We extended it somewhat to add some authentication data we needed and for the most part this has been great. The issue we are having is that the context we are giving to the controller has a null value in the HttpContext.Response.Output, which is causing some exceptions to be thrown. I'm not sure what to add to get this working. Here is the existing FakeHttpConext() method: public static HttpContextBase FakeHttpContext()
{
    var context = new Mock<HttpContextBase>();
    var request = new Mock<HttpRequestBase>();
    var response = new Mock<HttpResponseBase>();
    var session = new Mock<HttpSessionStateBase>();
    var server = new Mock<HttpServerUtilityBase>();

    // Our identity additions ...
    var user = new Mock<IPrincipal>();
    OurIdentity identity = (OurIdentity)Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity;

    context.Expect(ctx => ctx.Request).Returns(request.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx => ctx.Response).Returns(response.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx => ctx.Session).Returns(session.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx => ctx.Server).Returns(server.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx => ctx.User).Returns(user.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx => ctx.User.Identity).Returns(identity);
    return context.Object;
}
 Here is the exploding method (which is part of the MVC Contrib project's XmlResult): public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
{
    if (_objectToSerialize != null)
    {
       var xs = new XmlSerializer(_objectToSerialize.GetType());
       context.HttpContext.Response.ContentType = "text/xml";
       xs.Serialize(context.HttpContext.Response.Output, _objectToSerialize);
    }
}
 What do I need to add in the FakeHttpContext method to prevent the null exception when the context.HttpContext.Response.Output is referenced? Clarification: The solution I'm looking for needs to be done in Moq, not Rhino. I mentioned Moq in the question title but neglected that in question body. Sorry for any confusion. Resolution I added the following two lines of code to the FakeHttpContext() method: var writer = new StringWriter();
context.Expect(ctx => ctx.Response.Output).Returns(writer);
 This prevents the null exception. Not sure if its a good answer long term, but it works for now.
@CODE:public static HttpContextBase FakeHttpContext()
{
    var context = new Mock<HttpContextBase>();
    var request = new Mock<HttpRequestBase>();
    var response = new Mock<HttpResponseBase>();
    var session = new Mock<HttpSessionStateBase>();
    var server = new Mock<HttpServerUtilityBase>();

    var user = new Mock<IPrincipal>();
    OurIdentity identity = (OurIdentity)Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity;

@TITLE:How do I persuade a VS2005 msi to upgrade?
@CONTENT:I have a Windows service written in C# using VS2005. The installation is via a wizard that calls msiexec to install the msi file also created using VS2005. I am having trouble generating an msi file that will upgrade from one version of the service to another. The wizard program handles detection of the currently installed version, stopping the service, coming up with an appropriate command-line for msiexec and then re-starting the service. The existing msi has a version property of 1.1.02, the new one is 1.1.03. The product and upgrade codes are identical. Uninstalling 1.1.02 manually via add/remove programs works fine, as does installing 1.1.03 onto a "clean" system. Upgrading 1.1.02 to 1.1.03 goes through the motions but the end result is 1.1.02 installed. The command line that the wizard uses for upgrading is: msiexec /qb /i "MyProduct.msi" REINSTALL="ALL" REINSTALLMODE="vos" Where am I going wrong? I'm assuming I must have missed something fairly fundamental... The fall-back position is to inform customers that they need to manually uninstall 1.1.02 before running the wizard to install 1.1.03 but I'd rather not have to do that. Edited to add: Changing the product code (as VS2005 also prompts you to) actually removes the ability to upgrade at all, as it the installer won't let you do a reinstall if that product code hasn't previously been installed. All it will then let you do is install (and then you get the usual "service already exists" -type message).

@TITLE:Making sure a view exists
@CONTENT:I'm currently looking into unit testing for a new application I have to create. I've got the basic testing going nicely (testing the ActionResult classes is pretty nice). One thing I do want to make sure though, is that a viewpage exists in my solution. I'm not 100% sure my test is correct, so if anyone had suggestions, please don't hesitate! This is a test I have to check that my login method on my security controller is doing the right thing: [TestMethod]
public void Login()
{
    var authProvider = new Mock<IAuthenticationProvider>();
    var controller = new SecurityController(authProvider.Object);

    var result = controller.Login() as ViewResult;

    Assert.IsNotNull(result, "ActionResult should be of type ViewResult.");
    Assert.AreEqual(result.ViewName, "login", "Does not render login page.");
}
 My explanation of the test would be: call the method 'Login' on the controller Confirm it's rendering a view (by checking if it returns a ViewResult object) Confirm it's rendering the right view (by checking the viewname) What I would like to have is a third assert, to see if the view to be rendered actually exists. Some secondary questions I have would be: Should I split this test up? Should I rename it (like, err, LoginRendersCorrectView or something) Thanks! Note: I'm explicitly trying to avoid having to check the filesystem. I'm sort of hoping for a way to use the ViewEngine to confirm the view actually exists.
@CODE:[TestMethod]
public void Login()
{
    var authProvider = new Mock<IAuthenticationProvider>();
    var controller = new SecurityController(authProvider.Object);

@TITLE:What conventions/idioms/patterns are you using configuring IOC Containers using the new Fluent Interfaces
@CONTENT:I am in the middle of moving over a large body of code to Castle Trunk which includes the new fluent interface for configuring the container. Since the project has a huge windsorConfig xml file that is beyond maintainable, I thought I would start to take advantage of this new feature. I know other containers (e.g. StructureMap 2.0) also contain fluent interfaces for container configuration, so this question isn't based around Windsor. My question is what conventions/idioms/patterns are you using for container configuration using the new fluent style interfaces? My first thought was to create a static method somewhere (e.g. ContainerConfig.Config) that would load all the relevant types that the app uses into the container. My worry is eventually this monolithic function would end up being almost as unmaintainable as the xml config file (less the angle bracket tax). My second thought was to break it down so each dependent assembly, by convention exports its default configuration. I can see this been useful for hierarchies used internally by the assembly. But for types used externally should there configuration even be defined internally? The more I thought about it the more questions I seemed to raise. What are your thoughts on it?

@TITLE:Linq-to-Sql SubmitChanges not updating fields ¡K why?
@CONTENT:I posted this question yesterday evening, which has led me to discover a huge problem! I have a decimal column in my database called Units, anytime I set the value of the column to a NON ZERO, and SubmitChanges the column updates with the new value. If I try to set the value of the column to ZERO, the SubmitChanges does not update the column. data.Units = this.ReadProperty<decimal>(UnitsProperty);
data.UnitPrice = this.ReadProperty<decimal>(UnitPriceProperty);
data.Price = this.ReadProperty<decimal>(PriceProperty);
 I've taken a look at the DataContext log and I can see that the field with the ZERO value is not included in the query. Even if I try to hard code the change Linq ignores it. data.Units = 0;
data.UnitPrice = 0;
data.Price = 0;
 Needless to say this is killing me! Any ideas why this happening? Solution I figured out my problem with the help of the SO community. My problem was being caused by the fact when I created my entity to attach, the default value of the column was set to zero, so when it tried to assign the value to zero ... LinqToSql says hey ... nothing changed, so I am not updating the value. What I am doing now ... just to make it work is the following: ctx.DataContext.InvoiceItems.Attach(data, true);
 That seems to force all the values to write themselves to the database. This works for now.

data.UnitPrice = this.ReadProperty<decimal>(UnitPriceProperty);
data.Price = this.ReadProperty<decimal>(PriceProperty); data.Units = 0;

@TITLE:How would one make Python objects persistent in a web-app?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a reasonably complex web application. The Python backend runs an algorithm whose state depends on data stored in several interrelated database tables which does not change often, plus user specific data which does change often. The algorithm's per-user state undergoes many small changes as a user works with the application. This algorithm is used often during each user's work to make certain important decisions. For performance reasons, re-initializing the state on every request from the (semi-normalized) database data quickly becomes non-feasible. It would be highly preferable, for example, to cache the state's Python object in some way so that it can simply be used and/or updated whenever necessary. However, since this is a web application, there several processes serving requests, so using a global variable is out of the question. I've tried serializing the relevant object (via pickle) and saving the serialized data to the DB, and am now experimenting with caching the serialized data via memcached. However, this still has the significant overhead of serializing and deserializing the object often. I've looked at shared memory solutions but the only relevant thing I've found is POSH. However POSH doesn't seem to be widely used and I don't feel easy integrating such an experimental component into my application. I need some advice! This is my first shot at developing a web application, so I'm hoping this is a common enough issue that there are well-known solutions to such problems. At this point solutions which assume the Python back-end is running on a single server would be sufficient, but extra points for solutions which scale to multiple servers as well :) Notes: I have this application working, currently live and with active users. I started out without doing any premature optimization, and then optimized as needed. I've done the measuring and testing to make sure the above mentioned issue is the actual bottleneck. I'm sure pretty sure I could squeeze more performance out of the current setup, but I wanted to ask if there's a better way. The setup itself is still a work in progress; assume that the system's architecture can be whatever suites your solution.

 Couldn't find anything in the documentation on what exactly Release does EDIT: See my answer below for the results of tests I ran.

@CONTENT:My work place is very archaic when it comes to software development. Essentially all projects are forced to use a waterfall approach requiring immense paperwork. I've always been a fan of agile development and recently was approach by my manager asking for me to help him put together a proposal to some of the managers/directors to try to preach the benefits of Agile. Like stated the target audience is the managers and directors where I work. Many of them hold to the mantra of "If it's not broke don't fix it". I've found numerous case studies, instructional pages and all sorts of resources online however there are a few things I'm missing. First of all is there a good resource for the type of documentation that is typically done with an agile process? Our QA manager is a stickler on documentation and unfortunately is likely to ignore the whole concept if he's not happy with the quality/amount of paperwork that is done. Secondly are there any large companies (fortune 500 type size) that have publicly available information on their software development methodologies (specifically if such companies are using agile)?

@LINK:/questions/33637294/best-practice-for-parameter-ienumerable-vs-ilist-vs-ireadonlycollection
@TITLE:Best practice for parameter: IEnumerable vs. IList vs. IReadOnlyCollection
@CONTENT:I get when one would return an IEnumerable from a method¡Xwhen there's value in deferred execution. And returning a List or IList should pretty much be only when the result is going to be modified, otherwise I'd return an IReadOnlyCollection, so the caller knows what he's getting isn't intended for modification (and this lets the method even reuse objects from other callers). However, on the parameter input side, I'm a little less clear. I could take an IEnumerable, but what if I need to enumerate more than once? The saying "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept" suggests taking an IEnumerable is good, but I'm not really sure. For example, if there are no elements in the following IEnumerable parameter, a significant amount of work can be saved in this method by checking .Any() first, which requires ToList() before that to avoid enumerating twice. public IEnumerable<Data> RemoveHandledForDate(IEnumerable<Data> data, DateTime dateTime) {
   var dataList = data.ToList();

   if (!dataList.Any()) {
      return dataList;
   }

   var handledDataIds = new HashSet<int>(
      GetHandledDataForDate(dateTime) // Expensive database operation
         .Select(d => d.DataId)
   );

   return dataList.Where(d => !handledDataIds.Contains(d.DataId));
}
 So I'm wondering what is the best signature, here? One possibility is IList<Data> data, but accepting a list suggests that you plan to modify it, which is not correct¡Xthis method doesn't touch the original list, so IReadOnlyCollection<Data> seems better. But IReadOnlyCollection forces callers to do ToList().AsReadOnly() every time which gets a bit ugly, even with a custom extension method .AsReadOnlyCollection. And that's not being liberal in what is accepted. What is best practice in this situation? This method is not returning an IReadOnlyCollection because there may be value in the final Where using deferred execution as the whole list is not required to be enumerated. However, the Select is required to be enumerated because the cost of doing .Contains would be horrible without the HashSet. I don't have a problem with calling ToList, it just occurred to me that if I need a List to avoid multiple enumeration, why do I not just ask for one in the parameter? So the question here is, if I don't want an IEnumerable in my method, should I really accept one in order to be liberal (and ToList it myself), or should I put the burden on the caller to ToList().AsReadOnly()? Further Information for those unfamiliar with IEnumerables The real problem here is not the cost of Any() vs. ToList(). I understand that enumerating the entire list costs more than doing Any(). However, assume the case that the caller will consume all items in the return IEnumerable from the above method, and assume that the source IEnumerable<Data> data parameter comes from the result of this method: public IEnumerable<Data> GetVeryExpensiveDataForDate(DateTime dateTime) {
    // This query is very expensive no matter how many rows are returned.
    // It costs 5 seconds on each `.GetEnumerator` call to get 1 value or 1000
    return MyDataProvider.Where(d => d.DataDate == dateTime);
}
 Now if you do this: var myData = GetVeryExpensiveDataForDate(todayDate);
var unhandledData = RemoveHandledForDate(myData, todayDate);
foreach (var data in unhandledData) {
   messageBus.Dispatch(data); // fully enumerate
)
 And if RemovedHandledForDate does Any and does Where, you'll incur the 5 second cost twice, instead of once. This is why you should always take extreme pains to avoid enumerating an IEnumerable more than once. Do not rely on your knowledge that in fact it's harmless, because some future hapless developer may call your method some day with a newly implemented IEnumerable you never thought of, which has different characteristics. In fact, some IEnumerables are volatile, won't even return any data in the second enumeration. That's a totally breaking change. Don't do multiple enumeration. If you accept an IEnumerable parameter, you are in effect promising to enumerating it exactly 0 or 1 times.
@CODE:IEnumerable List IList IReadOnlyCollection IEnumerable IEnumerable IEnumerable .Any() ToList() public IEnumerable<Data> RemoveHandledForDate(IEnumerable<Data> data, DateTime dateTime) {
   var dataList = data.ToList();

   if (!dataList.Any()) {
      return dataList;
   }

   var handledDataIds = new HashSet<int>(
      GetHandledDataForDate(dateTime) // Expensive database operation
         .Select(d => d.DataId)
   );

   return dataList.Where(d => !handledDataIds.Contains(d.DataId));
} IList<Data> data IReadOnlyCollection<Data> IReadOnlyCollection ToList().AsReadOnly() .AsReadOnlyCollection IReadOnlyCollection Where Select .Contains HashSet ToList List IEnumerable ToList ToList().AsReadOnly() Any() ToList() Any() IEnumerable IEnumerable<Data> data public IEnumerable<Data> GetVeryExpensiveDataForDate(DateTime dateTime) {
    // This query is very expensive no matter how many rows are returned.
    // It costs 5 seconds on each `.GetEnumerator` call to get 1 value or 1000
    return MyDataProvider.Where(d => d.DataDate == dateTime);
} var myData = GetVeryExpensiveDataForDate(todayDate);
var unhandledData = RemoveHandledForDate(myData, todayDate);
foreach (var data in unhandledData) {
   messageBus.Dispatch(data); // fully enumerate

@TITLE:HKWorkoutSession isn't keeping app at front of Apple Watch
@CONTENT:It has been stated that an app running a HKWorkoutSession will have special privileges over other watchOS 2 apps, so when a user looks at their Apple Watch, it will go to the view showing running a workout rather than the watch face. Currently, on both my device and simulator, this is not the case. If I start a HKWorkoutSession and then leave for 5 minutes and then interact with either the Apple Watch, or the Watch Simulator, it presents the watch face. If I then open my app, it appears to have been frozen, rather than terminated (which is what I imagine happens to other apps). As the UI will update when I need receive a response in my query.updateHandler. Also if I set it to provide haptic feedback every time my query.updateHandler receives a new HKQuantitySample it will do so, so the app must be running in the background in some form. Has anyone else noticed this behaviour, and am I doing anything wrong, or expecting something I shouldn't?

 age and hours_per_week are integers while other features including label salaryRange are categorical (String) Loading this csv file (lets call it sample.csv) can be done by Spark csv library like this: val data = sqlContext.csvFile("/home/dusan/sample.csv")
 By default all columns are imported as string so we need to change "age" and "hours_per_week" to Int: val toInt    = udf[Int, String]( _.toInt)
val dataFixed = data.withColumn("age", toInt(data("age"))).withColumn("hours_per_week",toInt(data("hours_per_week")))
 Just to check how schema looks now: scala> dataFixed.printSchema
root
 |-- age: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- hours_per_week: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- education: string (nullable = true)
 |-- sex: string (nullable = true)
 |-- salaryRange: string (nullable = true)
 Then lets set the cross validator and pipeline: val rf = new RandomForestClassifier()
val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(rf)) 
val cv = new CrossValidator().setNumFolds(10).setEstimator(pipeline).setEvaluator(new BinaryClassificationEvaluator)
 Error shows up when running this line: val cmModel = cv.fit(dataFixed)
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Field "features" does not exist. It is possible to set label column and feature column in RandomForestClassifier ,however I have 4 columns as predictors (features) not only one. How I should organize my data frame so it has label and features columns organized correctly? For your convenience here is full code : import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
import org.apache.spark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier
import org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.BinaryClassificationEvaluator
import org.apache.spark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator

import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame

import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{Vector, Vectors}

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    //set spark context
    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Simple Application").setMaster("local");
    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
    val sqlContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext(sc)

    import sqlContext.implicits._
    import com.databricks.spark.csv._

    //load data by using databricks "Spark CSV Library" 
    val data = sqlContext.csvFile("/home/dusan/sample.csv")

    //by default all columns are imported as string so we need to change "age" and  "hours_per_week" to Int
    val toInt    = udf[Int, String]( _.toInt)

    // this fails with error
    //java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Field "features" does not exist.
    val cmModel = cv.fit(dataFixed)

@TITLE:iOS 8.3 Share Extension - Launching URL Schemes
@CONTENT:since iOS 8.3 update my share extension (which calls my main app using URL Schemes) stopped working. So I found out that the UIWebView approach I had to launch my app is not working anymore. I also tried the approach Apple recommends, using NSExtensionContext, and still no results. Any thoughts about this? My code follows: UIWebView *webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 0, 0)];
[self.view addSubview: webView];
NSString *urlString = "com.myappscheme://shareextension";
NSString * content = [NSString stringWithFormat : @"<head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0; URL=%@'></head>", urlString];
[webView loadHTMLString:content baseURL:nil];
 and [self.extensionContext openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString] completionHandler:^(BOOL success)
{
    NSLog(@"fun=%s after completion. success=%d", __func__, success);
}];
 I try executing both blocks of code on the didSelectPost method from my SLComposeServiceViewController controller, which was where it worked fine previously, before updating my device to iOS 8.3
@CODE:UIWebView *webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 0, 0)];

@TITLE:Is it possible to combine React Native with socket.io
@CONTENT:I was working on an app with Phonegap + React.js and Socket.io. However, then React-Native got released and the native feel is amazing. I tried getting socket.io-client working with React Native, but unfortunately without much success. I did some research and I'm getting the exact same errors as described in this issue: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/375 The comments on the issue said to try and use the fetch API to fetch JS modules, but I think I'm doing this wrong: var socketScript;    
fetch('https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js')
    .then(function(response) {
        socketScript = response._bodyText;
    }).done(function() {
        var socket = socketScript.io();
    });
 This returns an undefined is not a function. Is there any way to make socket.io-client work with React Native? Or am I looking at this the wrong way? Perhaps there are other, better suited solutions?

@TITLE:Core Data with WatchKit and iOS App
@CONTENT:This question has already been asked, but has received no answers. My iOS app and my WatchKit extension share an App Group in which a Core Data store persists. The Core Data model (simplified) is a Person object that has an attribute for Age. Both the app and extension can change the age at will. If the value for a person changes on the watch, the app does not reflect it unless I close and rerun the app. Same going the opposite direction. If I try to change the age on the watch to 20, and change the age on the phone to 30, then I get an error having to do with merge conflicts, because I am not using the most up-to-date version of the NSManagedObject on one of the devices (whichever I change the age on last). How can I make the two work together without any issues?

    let savingsInformationViewController = storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("SavingsAddPopover") as UIViewController
    savingsInformationViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .Popover
    savingsInformationViewController.preferredContentSize = CGSizeMake(200, 200)



    let popoverController = savingsInformationViewController.popoverPresentationController
    popoverController?.sourceView = sender
    popoverController?.permittedArrowDirections = .Any
    popoverController?.delegate = self




    presentViewController(savingsInformationViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
 I would have thought I could reference the data object from the popover but can't..at least not the way I'm thinking.

@TITLE:Generate token in controller
@CONTENT:I'm using Owin and ASP.NET Identity to use OAuth tokens for securing my Web API methods. The token subsystem is set up as such: var oauthOptions = new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions()
{
    TokenEndpointPath = new PathString("/Token"),
    Provider = new SimpleAuthorizationServerProvider(),
    AccessTokenFormat = new TicketDataFormat(app.CreateDataProtector(typeof(OAuthAuthorizationServerMiddleware).Namespace, "Access_Token", "v1")),
    RefreshTokenFormat = new TicketDataFormat(app.CreateDataProtector(typeof(OAuthAuthorizationServerMiddleware).Namespace, "Refresh_Token", "v1")),
    AccessTokenProvider = new AuthenticationTokenProvider(),
    RefreshTokenProvider = new AuthenticationTokenProvider(),
    AccessTokenExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromDays(14),
    AllowInsecureHttp = true
};

app.UseOAuthAuthorizationServer(oauthOptions);
app.UseOAuthBearerAuthentication(new OAuthBearerAuthenticationOptions());
 It works great for requesting tokens based on username/password and then consuming those tokens. However, since the user is already authenticated when hitting the controller that renders the SPA, I would like to generate the token in my view and pass it on to the Javascript code, instead of having to log in again in the SPA. So my question is: how do I manually generate my token so I can include it in my SPA view?
@CODE:var oauthOptions = new OAuthAuthorizationServerOptions()
{
    TokenEndpointPath = new PathString("/Token"),
    Provider = new SimpleAuthorizationServerProvider(),

@TITLE:Node.js cluster doesn't significantly improve performance
@CONTENT:In case someone wants to try: https://github.com/codependent/cluster-performance I am testing Node.js (v0.11.13 - Windows 7) request per second limits with a simple application. I have implemented a service with Express 4 that simulates an I/O operation such as a DB query with a setTimeout callback. First I test it with only one node process. For the second test I start as many workers as CPUs the machine has. I am using loadtest to test the service with the following parameters: loadtest -n 50000 -c 220 -k http://localhost:5000/operations/timeout/20
 That is to say, 50k total requests, 220 concurrent clients. My service sets the timeout (the duration of the processing time) according to the last url parameter (20 mseg): router.route('/timeout/:time')
.get(function(req, res) {
    setTimeout(function(){
        appLog.debug("Timeout completed %d", process.pid);
        res.json(200,{result:process.pid});
    },req.param('time'));
});    
 Only one node process These are the results: INFO Max requests:        50000

 2580 requests per second, not bad. n workers (n = numCPUs) In this case I distribute the load equally among the workers using the round robin scheduling policy. Since now there are 8 cores processing requests I was expecting a significant improvement (8 times faster?) in the requests per second results but it only increased to 2905 rps!!! (318 rps more) How can you explain that? Am I doing something wrong? Results: Max requests:        50000

 UPDATE: I have finally accepted slebetman's answer since he was right about the reason why in this case cluster performance didn't significantly increase with up to 8 processes. However I would like to point out an interesting fact: with the current io.js version (2.4.0), it has really improved even for this high I/O operation (setTimeout): loadtest -n 50000 -c 220 -k http://localhost:5000/operations/timeout/20

 So it's clear that with the current io.js/node.js releases, although you don't get an 8x rps increase, the thoughput is almost 1.7 times faster. On the other hand, as expected, using a for loop iterating for the amount of milliseconds indicated in the request (and thus, blocking the thread), the rps increases proportionally to the number of threads.

@CONTENT:I am working on a windows phone 8.1 universal app and want to find the best way of handling page navigations without having large amounts of logic in the code behind. I want to keep the code behind in my View as uncluttered as possible. What is the accepted MVVM way of navigating to a new page in response to a button click? I currently have to send a RelayComnmand message from the ViewModel to the view with the details of the page to navigate to. This means that the code behind has to be wired up as follows:     public MainPage()
    {
      InitializeComponent();
      Messenger.Default.Register<OpenArticleMessage>(this, (article) => ReceiveOpenArticleMessage(article));
...
}

    private object ReceiveOpenArticleMessage(OpenArticleMessage article)
    {
     Frame.Navigate(typeof(ArticleView));
   }
 This just doesn't seem the best way although it does work. How can I do the page navigations directly from the ViewModel? I am using MVVM-Light in my project.

@TITLE:Law of Demeter with data model objects
@CONTENT:I came back to work from vacation yesterday, and in our daily standup, my teammates mentioned they were refactoring all of the model objects in our java code to remove all getters and setters and make the model fields all public objects instead, invoking the Law of Demeter as the reason for doing so because to facilitate the our adherence to Demeter's law: a module should not know about the innards of the 'objects' it manipulates. Since data structures contain no behavior, they naturally exposes their internal structure. So in that case, Demeter does not apply. I admit I had to brush up on my knowledge of the LoD, but for the life of me I can't find anything to indicate that this is within the spirit of the law. None of the getters/setters in our models contain any business logic, which is his justification for doing this so clients of these objects don't have to unerstand whether or not there is some business logic being executed within the get/set methods. I think this is a misunderstanding of what it means to need 'internal knowledge of an objects structure', or at the very least is taking it too literally and breaking a pretty standard convention in the process. So my question is, does it actually make any sense to expose model objects interal structure directly instead of via getters/setters in the name of the LoD? Thanks

I will select my important apps like messaging, gmail, etc and put a pin or password on it for 30 minutes while she plays angry birds. After 30 minutes, I get my phone from my daughter and I can open the app without a pin because the time limit expired. I have done a ton of research on this, but I haven't been able to find an implementation for my particular case. How do android "app lock" applications work? I know that app lock has a similar kind of structure of what I want to do. I just to place a time limit for the lock. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.domobile.applock&hl=en I am staying away from killing activities/ applications with ActivityManager etc. I really just want a clean lock screen over a selected app for a particular amount of time.

@TITLE:Generating and saving a list of ParseObjects within a Parse.Cloud.httpRequest in a cloud function
@CONTENT:So, I'm defining a cloud function that's supposed to make a call to the foursquare api and generate a list of restaurants (each restaurant is a ParseObject) from the returned JSON. I successfully do this, but I run into problems when trying to save these objects to my database and send them back to my phone by calling response.success(). The large code block below saves the list to my database, but if I try Parse.Object.saveAll(restaurants)
response.success(restaurants)
 I end the function before all of the restaurants are saved. I tried using this line instead Parse.Object.saveAll(restaurants).then(response.success(restaurants))
 , but only half of the restaurants get saved before I get the error "Failed with: Uncaught Tried to save an object with a pointer to a new, unsaved object." I also get this error if I call response.success(restaurants) without attempting to save the list. I read that this is a bug in parse preventing someone from printing or passing unsaved ParseObjects. Any ideas? I also tried using .then on the http request, but I get the same issues or a new error: "com.parse.ParseException: i/o failure: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out.

@TITLE:SceneKit. Which way is up?
@CONTENT:It seems that most 3D authoring applications use Z as the 'Up' axis. While SceneKit uses Y as the 'Up' axis. SceneKit allows you to load scenes as Collada .DAE files. When loading a Scene via either: SCNScene(named: String?, inDirectory: String?, options: [NSObject : AnyObject]?)
 or SCNSceneSource(URL url: NSURL!, options: [NSObject : AnyObject]!)
 You can specify options including SCNSceneSourceConvertToYUpKey and SCNSceneSourceConvertUnitsToMetersKey. Setting these accordingly, I expected the various nodes to be transformed and scaled when I added them to my own scene constructed from Nodes in the loaded scene. But these options appear to have no effect. let myScene = SCNScene(named: "Scene.dae", inDirectory: nil, options: [SCNSceneSourceConvertToYUpKey:true, SCNSceneSourceConvertUnitsToMetersKey:25.4])
 Have I misunderstood the meaning of these option parameters?

@TITLE:How do i implement Awesomium 1.7.4.2 in a Monogame project?
@CONTENT:Im trying to render render a browser in side my monogame project, for drawing some interface & stuff. I've done this in the past with older versions of awesomium with no problems. But i can't figure out how to properbly initialize awesomium in this new version, I get an error no matter how i try to go about it. As i understand it i need to call WebCore.Run() once, instead of WebCore.Update(), but i get varius exceptions from that method. Here are the steps that i've followed so far: Install Awesomium 1.7.4.2 Refrenced \1.7.4.2\wrappers\Awesomium.NET\Assemblies\Packed\Awesomium.Core.dll in my project Here is some of my attempts:     WebCore.Initialize(new WebConfig());
    WebCore.Run();
    //Error: Starting an update loop on a thread with an existing message loop, is not supported.
     WebCore.Initialized += (sender, e) =>
    {
        WebCore.Run();
    };
    WebCore.Initialize(new WebConfig());
    WebView WebView = WebCore.CreateWebView(500, 400);
    //Error: Starting an update loop on a thread with an existing message loop, is not supported.
     WebCore.Initialize(new WebConfig());
    WebView WebView = WebCore.CreateWebView(500, 400);
    WebView.Source = new Uri("http://www.google.com");
    WebView.DocumentReady += (sender, e) =>
    {
        JSObject js = WebView.CreateGlobalJavascriptObject("w");
    };
    // No errors, but DocumentReady is never fired..
 I have also managed to get NullRefrence errors, and if i wait Thread.Sleep(400) before calling WebCore.Run(), it just enters the WebCore.Run() and never completes that line. How do i set this up? Can't find any examples anywhere. All the examples online still tells you to use Update wich is Obsolete
@CODE:\1.7.4.2\wrappers\Awesomium.NET\Assemblies\Packed\Awesomium.Core.dll WebCore.Initialize(new WebConfig());
    WebCore.Run();
    //Error: Starting an update loop on a thread with an existing message loop, is not supported. WebCore.Initialized += (sender, e) =>
    {
        WebCore.Run();

@TITLE:AngularJS update input manually does not trigger change in the model
@CONTENT:When I am changing a value of an input element from plain JavaScript then the angular model is not updated. Is there any way to trigger somehow this update by firing some event manually after the change? <body ng-controller="MainCtrl">

@TITLE:Handling specific errors by sending another request transparently in retrofit
@CONTENT:Here's the case I'm trying to handle, If a request is executed, and the response indicates the auth token is expired, send a refresh token request if the refresh token request succeeds, retry the original request This should be transparent to the calling Activity, Fragment... etc. From the caller's point of view, it's one request, and one response. I've achieved this flow before when using OkHttpClient directly, but I don't know how to achieve this in Retrofit. Maybe something related to this open issue about a ResponseInterceptor? If there's no straight-forward way to achieve this in retrofit, what would be the best way to implement it? A base listener class? I'm using RoboSpice with Retrofit as well, if it can be helpful in such case.

@TITLE:How To Insert Partial views Dynamically in Asp.Net MVC
@CONTENT:I am migrating a Webforms site to MVC. In my webforms site I have pages that utilise various combinations of User Controls, then chunks of html then Labels, Textboxes etc. I don't want to hardwire each page so I am going to drive the output for each page from a CMS which specifies the order to insert the controls into the page. I imagine each control will now be a Partial View in MVC. (Let me know if that's not correct). So if I have two different partial views, ViewA and ViewB, how do I create a controller method that inserts the partial views into the view that is returned in the order determined by the CMS for a given url? So assuming the controller method is called Reports and it takes a parameter called product. eg //MySite/Reports?product=A returns a view containing ViewA, ViewA, ViewB, ViewA whereas //MySite/Reports?product=B returns a view containing ViewA, ViewB, ViewA, ViewB etc So what should the code be for the controller method? I hope that makes sense

        Cursor c = db.rawQuery(selectQuery, null);

@TITLE:How do I client-side upload a viewable file to Amazon S3?
@CONTENT:Let me start of by saying that I am normally very reluctant to post this questions as I always feel that there's an answer to everything SOMEWHERE on the internet. After spending countless hours looking for an answer to this question, I've finally given up on this statement however. Assumption This works: s3.getSignedUrl('putObject', params);
 What am I trying to do? Upload a file via PUT (from the client-side) to Amazon S3 using the getSignedUrl method Allow anyone to view the file that was uploaded to S3 Note: If there's an easier way to allow client side (iPhone) uploads to Amazon S3 with pre-signed URLs (and without exposing credentials client-side) I'm all ears. Main Problems* When viewing the AWS Management Console, the file uploaded has blank Permissions and Metadata set. When viewing the uploaded file (i.e. by double clicking the file in AWS Management Console) I get an AccessDenied error. What have I tried? Try #1: My original code In NodeJS I generate a pre-signed URL like so: var params = {Bucket: mybucket, Key: "test.jpg", Expires: 600};
s3.getSignedUrl('putObject', params, function (err, url){
  console.log(url); // this is the pre-signed URL
});
 The pre-signed URL looks something like this: https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AABFBIAWAEAUKAYGAFAA&Expires=1391069292&Signature=u%2BrqUtt3t6BfKHAlbXcZcTJIOWQ%3D
 Now I upload the file via PUT curl -v -T myimage.jpg https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AABFBIAWAEAUKAYGAFAA&Expires=1391069292&Signature=u%2BrqUtt3t6BfKHAlbXcZcTJIOWQ%3D
 PROBLEM I get the *Main Problems listed above Try #2: Adding Content-Type and ACL on PUT I've also tried adding the Content-Type and x-amz-acl in my code by replacing the params like so: var params = {Bucket: mybucket, Key: "test.jpg", Expires: 600, ACL: "public-read-write", ContentType: "image/jpeg"};
 Then I try a good ol' PUT: curl -v -H "image/jpeg" -T myimage.jpg https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AABFBIAWAEAUKAYGAFAA&Content-Type=image%2Fjpeg&Expires=1391068501&Signature=0yF%2BmzDhyU3g2hr%2BfIcVSnE22rY%3D&x-amz-acl=public-read-write
 PROBLEM My terminal outputs some errors: -bash: Content-Type=image%2Fjpeg: command not found
-bash: x-amz-acl=public-read-write: command not found
 And I also get the *Main Problems listed above. Try #3: Modifying Bucket Permissions to be public All of the items listed below are ticked in the AWS Management Console) Grantee: Everyone can [List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions]

@TITLE:Is there a complete list of Implementation-Defined behavior in C++?
@CONTENT:I was replying to a comment on my answer: C job interview - casting and comparing and found that I could not find a complete list of what C++ deems "Implementation-Defined behavior." I'm aware there are 3 categories for this sort of thing: Undefined behavior, Implementation-Defined behavior, and Unspecified behavior; however it seems most discussions center around Undefined behavior, and when Implementation-Defined behavior is discussed, at most one example of it is given. In general I tend to write a lot of code that traipses into this area and I know what sort of behavior to expect; still I would like to be able to knowledgeably be able to comment on its validity. I would also like to throw out there that I think there is a lot of misdiagnoses in the community of operations being undefined, when really they are well defined by the platform. Please note that I am not so much interested in how a given platform chooses to define such behavior, but rather to have a list of all behavior that falls into the ¡§Implementation-Defined¡¨ category as defined by the C++ standard.

@LINK:/questions/21040766/python-pandas-rolling-apply-two-column-input-into-function
@TITLE:Python pandas rolling_apply two column input into function
@CONTENT:Following on from this question Python custom function using rolling_apply for pandas, about using rolling_apply. Although I have progressed with my function, I am struggling to deal with a function that requires two or more columns as inputs: Creating the same setup as before import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random

tmp  = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(2000,2)/10000, 
                    index=pd.date_range('2001-01-01',periods=2000),
                    columns=['A','B'])
 But changing the function slightly to take two columns. def gm(df,p):
    df = pd.DataFrame(df)
    v =((((df['A']+df['B'])+1).cumprod())-1)*p
    return v.iloc[-1]
 It produces the following error: pd.rolling_apply(tmp,50,lambda x: gm(x,5))

  KeyError: u'no item named A'
 I think it is because the input to the lambda function is an ndarray of length 50 and only of the first column, and doesn't take two columns as the input. Is there a way to get both columns as inputs and use it in a rolling_apply function. Again any help would be greatly appreciated...
@CODE:rolling_apply import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random

tmp  = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(2000,2)/10000, 
                    index=pd.date_range('2001-01-01',periods=2000),
                    columns=['A','B']) def gm(df,p):
    df = pd.DataFrame(df)
    v =((((df['A']+df['B'])+1).cumprod())-1)*p
    return v.iloc[-1] pd.rolling_apply(tmp,50,lambda x: gm(x,5))

@LINK:/questions/20934412/efficient-search-of-sorted-numerical-values
@TITLE:Efficient search of sorted numerical values
@CONTENT:I have an int[] array that contains values with the following properties: They are sorted They are unique (no duplicates) They are in a known range [0..MAX) MAX is typically quite a lot larger than the length of the array (say 10-100x) Sometimes the numbers are evenly distributed across the range, but at other times there are quite long sequences of consecutive numbers. I estimate it is about 50/50 between the two cases. Given this list, I want to efficiently find the index of a specific value in the array (or if the value is not present, find the next higher value). I've already implemented a straight binary search with interval bisection that works fairly well, but I have a suspicion that the nature/distribution of the data can be exploited to converge to a solution faster. I'm interested in optimising the average case search time, but it is important that the worst case is never worse than O(log n) as the arrays are sometimes very large. Question: it is possible to do much better than a plain binary search in the average case? EDIT (to clarify additional questions / comments) The constant in O(log n) definitely matters. In fact assuming that better algorithmic complexity than O(log n) isn't possible, the constant is probably the only thing that matters..... It's often a one-off search, so while preprocessing is possible it's probably not going to be worth it.

@CONTENT:I have read CLLocationManager kCLErrorDomain Codes? as well as Apple Docs I check to make sure ranging is available before calling startRangingBeaconsInRegion: and I am also checking if ranging is available while in the locationManager:rangingBeaconsDidFailForRegion:withError: method. Returns true both times. When I get the set of monitoredRegions, my beacon is in the set (so registering for monitoring is working). I have read that error 16 can mean ranging is unavailable, bluetooth could be off, location services could be off, airplane mode could be on, I have checked them all and all are available and running (obviously not in airplane mode). What could be causing the ranging to fail, every time I run the app?

 And i have at the moment a: List<Task> tmp = new List<Task>();
 where i add the tasks. I start the tasks like this: foreach (Task t in tmp)
{
    await t;
}
 Now my Question: What`s the best way to start the tasks and only run 3 of them, at the same time (until the others are waiting)? I think i need something like a queue/waiting list? It should also be possible to add more tasks after the queue is started. I`am using .NET 4.5. Thank you for any suggestion
