@TITLE:draw rectangles and annotate webpage
@CONTENT:What is the best utility/api to use in order to draw rectangles and annotate a webpage within the browser? I need the user to be able to draw a box over the existing html content, and type a message into an annotation for the box. Similar functionality can be found here - openlayers allows you to draw shapes on the map. EDIT: I need the solution to be cross browser, and as lightweight as possible. Prototypejs is already embedded in this application, if that can be leveraged then that is a bonus.

@TITLE:Alert Bar rather than alert box
@CONTENT:I now have a script that prevents users from entering anything but a state abbreviation in the state field of my form. Thanks to gideon I modified the script just a little to include an alert message when an invalid state is entered. But I don't really like it. I am going for an alert bar that flashes on the top of the page or maybe right below the field. Something that appears automatically when an incorrect abbreviation is entered and flash to grab the users attention and disappear after a few seconds. Any ideas or thoughts would be welcome! I am VERY open to suggestions! Thanks once again! I am starting to think you guy's are not understanding me. This is the code I have: <script>
                        function validateState(el) {
                        //put all states in this array.

 Of course, this question is purely hypothetic, I am not stupid enough to attempt to calculate a table of prime numbers in an DBMS. But the question remains: is there a clean way to hack around the absence of LATERAL? As you can see, I tried with a view (does not work), function around this view (does not work either), a temp table in this function (njet), and twiddling the function's attributes. Next step will probably be some trigger-hack (but I really,really hate triggers, basically because they are invisible to the strictness of the DBMS schema)

    // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.

                try {

                    String zip = jarray.getString("ZIPCODE");
                    zipcodes.add(zip);
                    arrayAdapter1.add(zip);

@CONTENT:Okay, So I figured out on my own how to make a mobile site out of an Artisteer template. Basically, I changed the sheet to 100% fluid width, minimum 300 px, one column, got rid of the menu and replaced it with a vertical menu, got rid of most of the blocks or put them under the vertical menu, made everything smaller and simpler. Smaller fonts, got rid of most of the padding except for 3px, made the header shorter, made the vertical menu bars tall enough to press with a finger, etc. My new mobile-friendly site looks great. So now what? Do I export it as a WordPress theme and then have two installations of WordPress for every website? Or do I export it as html, use a redirect WordPress plugin, an add an RSS feed? Hmm...I think I may try html, but would love some feedback anyhow.

@CONTENT:I am designing a drawing app where user can import image from gallery and then scale up or down to fit the screen width or height. so that user can draw onto the imported picture, using the below code. I am extending View, named DrawView. The DrawView is same as screenwidth, but its height is less than screenheight because there are some buttons above it, placing the DrawView to the bottom of the Screen under the functioning buttons, and so I declared DrawViewHeight. See below for examples for dimension and results of variables. Question: The bitmap can be properly loaded and scaled to fit to the DrawView. However, it is located at the top of the DrawView. I would like to place it in the middle of the screen, so i added the following code but still FAILS. bitmapCanvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, x_adjustment, y_adjustment, null);
 How could it be further modified such that the imported image (decoded and copied as bitmap while importing) is placed center of DrawView, with blank space (eg. white) above and below and left and right of the loaded scaled bitmap image? Note: Those surrounding space around the image are not to be drawn onto by user. Codes: Declarations: private Bitmap bitmap; // drawing area for display or saving

 I am getting gobbledygook for my for loop print out. There are at least two reasons for the gobbledygook: my regex expression is wrong, or my for loop is wrong.

@TITLE:Path method displayed with rake routes is still undefined
@CONTENT:After getting rid of this question, I get one another. I have a path method specified in routes resources :tree_nurseries do .... And shows correctly when I do rake routes which gives new_tree_nursery then normally new_tree_nursery_path will be available. But, when I call it with a link_to method, it remains undefiend.... (new_tree_nursery_path) What did I missed again? this is the code line : .actions
  = link_to t('.new', :default => t("helpers.links.new")), new_tree_nursery_path, :class => 'btn btn-primary pull-right'

@TITLE:Deserialise JSON with random key
@CONTENT:I am accessing an API which is returning JSon in the format: {"status":1,"complete":1,"list":{"293352541":{"item_id":"293352541","fave":"0"},"247320106":{"item_id":"247320106","fave":"0"},"291842735":{"item_id":"291842735","fave":"0"} .....
 The problem I am having is with the number before the item_id tag. It is breaking any attempt I make at deserialising as I cannot represent this random integer in an object that I deserialise in to. I would expect this number to be, for example, the word "Item", so that it is key representing the enclosed object, but having this number means I cannot make an object representation of the JSon. So public class MyClass
{
    public string status { get; set; }
    public string complete { get; set; }
    public List<MyObject> list { get; set; }
}

public class MyObject
{
    public string item_id { get; set; }
    public string fave { get; set; }
}
 then  var items = new JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize<MyClass>(jsontext);
 dersialises, but items.list is empty. Also, dynamic result = JSon.Parse(jsontext);
 works, but I cannot deserialise or access the list of items in a nice way. Is there any way to do this? thanks
@CODE:{"status":1,"complete":1,"list":{"293352541":{"item_id":"293352541","fave":"0"},"247320106":{"item_id":"247320106","fave":"0"},"291842735":{"item_id":"291842735","fave":"0"} ..... public class MyClass
{
    public string status { get; set; }
    public string complete { get; set; }
    public List<MyObject> list { get; set; }
}

public class MyObject

    public string item_id { get; set; }

@TITLE:rewrite connection and query from mysql to mysqli
@CONTENT:Been always used MySQL with PHP with the typical mysql_query or mysql_fetch_array but now i'm moving to Mysqli since it will be the future. I'm newbie and using it for personal so i decide to ask you how to rewrite all this in rules of Mysqli Let us suppose we've the following database users(id,name,job,number) CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `name` varchar(255) default '0',
  `job` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `number` varchar(255) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=3 ;

INSERT INTO `users` VALUES (1, 'John', 'Plumber', '555');
INSERT INTO `users` VALUES (2, 'Iva', 'Reporter', '666');
INSERT INTO `users` VALUES (3, 'Robert', 'Writer', '777');
INSERT INTO `users` VALUES (4, 'Irin', 'Writer', '888');
 Now those are of normal Mysql so can anyone rewrite to be with Mysqli 1) Connection $DB["host"]   = "localhost";
$DB["dbName"] = "dbname";
$DB["user"]   = "dbuser";
$DB["pass"]   = "dbpass";
$link = mysql_connect($DB["host"],$DB["user"],$DB["pass"]) or die("Connection Failed");
mysql_select_db($DB["dbName"]);
 2) Call from the database exact entry     $sql = "select * from users where job='Plumber'";
    $reg = mysql_query($sql) or die(mysql_error());
    $aee = mysql_fetch_array($reg);

    echo $aee[name]; // should gives name John
 3) Call from the database results $qry="select * from users where job='Writer'";
$result=mysql_query($qry) or die($qry);

if(mysql_num_rows($result)=='0'){

echo "No results"; // if not found any for this conditional job

}else{
while($line=mysql_fetch_array($result)){

echo $line[name]."<br>"; // should gives Robert <br> Irin

}
}
 That would really helps me a lot and discourage me to open next new question for insert,update,delete as i believe this helpful for newbies like me ~ Thanks

@TITLE:X-Code OS/X: How to display results of a core data fetch request in a table view
@CONTENT:I perform a fetch request on a managed object context that is written into an array. The fetch itself works well and the array is filled correctly. However, as I try to display the array contents in a (cell based) table view nothing is displayed. The setup is as follows: A NSArrayControllers content array is bound to the File's Owner results array (which, as far as I understand, is filled with NSManagedObject objects). Here I tried both, entity and class mode. The table views content is bound to the array controllers arranged objects. The table columns values are bound to the array controller using controller key: arranged object, model key path: properties name (as defined in the data model). I also created a NSManagedObject subclass for my Objects in order to access the properties for the binding in class mode. None of the above had the table view filled with the results of the fetch request. So, can anyone assist me in getting this correct? Thanks! As requested, here is the code for the fetch method (everything else is done in the Interface Builder): - (IBAction)fetch:(id)sender {

@TITLE:Change the speed of another application [closed]
@CONTENT:I'll be very specific about this, this is a real question and I'm facing a real problem right now. I don't want to optimize my program, or my code, in order to make it run faster, its not that. I must write a program that changes the 'speed' of another program. An example for this is CE 'speedhack', you select a target program and makes it run faster or slower, if you're playing a flash game in a browser you can slow down the flash plugin speed which makes the game run 'faster' or 'slower'. I know that CE does this loading a library into the other program and most certainly the library creates a thread at DllMain, DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH which will change the 'speed' of other threads in the program. So it doesn't even gets to be 'other' application at that case. All I want is the right direction for this, how is this 'speed' changed. Please do not close my question, if you did not understand please leave a comment I'll provide necessary details. I'm a real programmer looking for a real answer.

@TITLE:EntityFramework Code First inheritance with custom discriminator
@CONTENT:I'm trying to map the following inheritance in EntityFramework Code First public class Member
{
    public string ProjectName { get; set; }
    public string AssemblyName { get; set; }
    public string NamespaceName { get; set; }

}

public class Field : Member

    public bool IsVolatile { get; set; }
}

public enum MemberType
{
    Constructor,
    Field,
    Method,
    Operator,
    Property
}
 As you can probably guess from the code, in time I plan to add more subclasses of Member (named Constructor, Method, Operator and Property), but first I'd just like to get the Field one to work properly. My mapping-code looks like this modelBuilder.Entities<Member>().Configure(config =>
{
    config.HasKey(m => new { m.ProjectName, m.AssemblyName, m.NamespaceName, m.TypeName, m.Signature });
    config.Property(m => m.DisplayName).IsRequired();
    config.ToTable("Members");
});

modelBuilder.Entities<Field>().Configure(config =>
{
    config.HasKey(f => new { f.ProjectName, f.AssemblyName, f.NamespaceName, f.TypeName, f.Signature });
});

modelBuilder.Entity<Member>()
    .Map<Field>(m => 
    {
        m.ToTable("Fields");
        m.Requires("Type").HasValue((int)Service.DataTypes.MemberType.Field).IsRequired();
    }); // note: realy not certain about this one
 What I would like, is to generate two tables. One named "Members", and one named "Fields", and use the Type-property in the Member-class as a discriminator, and I'm sure I'm just doing something really stupid here, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do it. Because with the current code, it generates a column in the "Fields" table named "Type", which you obviously wouldn't need as that'd be a constant. So I'm just wondering, could somebody please tell me what on earth I'm doing wrong?
@CODE:public class Member
{
    public string ProjectName { get; set; }
    public string AssemblyName { get; set; }
    public string NamespaceName { get; set; }
    public string TypeName { get; set; }
    public string Signature { get; set; }
    public string DisplayName { get; set; }
    public MemberType Type { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }
    public bool IsStatic { get; set; }
    public bool IsInherited { get; set; }

    //public virtual Type ParentType { get; set; } // ignore this
}

public class Field : Member
{

@TITLE:Offline File Transfer XMPP
@CONTENT:I need a Openfire plugin component or direction to develop myself to deal with offline file sharing. In one of our IM applications for iOS (like WhatsApp) we use Stream Initiation to transfer a file using a media proxy. This works ok, however if the recipient is offline you can't setup the bytestream. To overcome this limitation I'm looking for alternatives and one i'm looking into is: If SI fails because recipient is offline the file is transfered to a custom openfire module that store the file and original message A openfire plugin or server component will send the file and message once the recipient becomes available (online) Anyone have experience with this and or has complemenatry ideas

@LINK:/questions/14670792/iterparse-fails-to-parse-a-field-while-other-similar-ones-are-fine
@TITLE:iterparse fails to parse a field, while other similar ones are fine
@CONTENT:I use Python's iterparse to parse the XML result of a nessus scan (.nessus file). The parsing fails on unexpected records, wile similar ones have been parsed correctly. The general structure of the XML file is a lot of records like the one below: <ReportHost>
  <ReportItem>
    <foo>9.3</foo>
    <bar>hello</bar>
  </ReportItem>
  <ReportItem>
     <foo>10.0</foo>
     <bar>world</bar>
</ReportHost>
<ReportHost>
   ...
</ReportHost>
 In other words a lot of hosts (ReportHost) with a lot of items to report (ReportItem), and the latter having several characteristics (foo, bar). I will be looking at generating one line per item, with its characteristics. The parsing fails in the middle of the file at a simple line (foo in that case being cvss_base_score) <cvss_base_score>9.3</cvss_base_score>
 while ~200 similar lines have been parsed without problems. The relevant piece of code is below -- it sets context markers (inReportHost and inReportEvent which tell me where in the stricture of the XML file I am in, and either assign or print a value, depending on the context) import xml.etree.cElementTree as ET
inReportHost = False
inReportItem = False

for event, elem in ET.iterparse("test2.nessus", events=("start", "end")):
    if event == 'start' and elem.tag == "ReportHost":
        inReportHost = True
    if event == 'end' and elem.tag == "ReportHost":
        inReportHost = False
        elem.clear()
    if inReportHost:
        if event == 'start' and elem.tag == 'ReportItem':
            inReportItem = True
            cvss = ''
        if event == 'start' and inReportItem:
            if event == 'start' and elem.tag == 'cvss_base_score':
                cvss = elem.text
        if event == 'end' and elem.tag == 'ReportItem':
            print cvss
            inReportItem = False
 cvss sometimes has the None value (after the cvss = elem.text assignment), even though identical entries have been parsed properely earlier in the file. If I add below the assignement something along the lines of if cvss is None: cvss = "0"
 then the parsing of many further cvss assign their proper values (and some other are None). When taking the <ReportHost>...</reportHost> which causes the wrong parsing and running it through the program - it works fine (ie. cvss is assigned 9.3 as expected). I am lost at where I make a mistake in my code since, withing a large set of similar records, some apre processed correctly and some - not (some of the records are identical, and still are processed differently). I also cannot find anything particular about the records that fail - identical ones earlier and later are fine.
@CODE:iterparse <ReportHost>
  <ReportItem>
    <foo>9.3</foo>
    <bar>hello</bar>

     <bar>world</bar>
</ReportHost>
<ReportHost>
   ...

inReportHost = False
inReportItem = False

        inReportHost = False
        elem.clear()

 Looks like most of the browsers supports the CROS so you can write a script save it as .html and open it in browser and it will do a Ajax request successfully *provided that the server you are making request supports it *. In this case my web server (service) does not support CROS (and default configuration of Apache will not support it). Many of the web-services have enabled the CROS eg http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=? hence the request goes through successfully.

FILE_NAME
    : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '0'..'9' | '_' | '.')+
    ;
 So the difference between CMD_NAME, ARG and FILE_NAME is not large, CMD_NAME must be lower case letters, ARG can have upper case letter and "_" and FILE_NAME yet can have ".". But this has a problem, when I test the rule with - #include "abc", 'abc' is interpreted as CMD_NAME instead of FILE_NAME, I think it is because CMD_NAME is before FILE_NAME in the grammar file, this leads to parsing error. Do I have to rely on such technique as predict to deal with this? Is there a pure EBNF solution other than relying on host programming language? Thanks.

@TITLE:How do I run a java application like I would a typical program, using a shortcut?
@CONTENT:I'm currently using an IDE for writing a java application and testing it. In the IDE, I can run the application and see how it works. However, how would I run the application using a shortcut, or a jar file? For example, in order to run my WAMP server, I run the wamp.exe file in the WAMP directory. So, I'm running a single file which launches the entire program. How do I achieve this sort of thing with a java application? I've heard about using a jar file, but I'm unsure about whether that would be the proper way to do this or not.

@TITLE:Improper iPhone orientation?
@CONTENT:I can't figure out why this isn't working. I'm writing a game that involves scrolling rows/columns of blocks around the screen. I have my orientation limited strictly to Portrait, but it doesn't behave as so. When I call the method below, it is handed the velocity from the pan. Using logs I was able to see that holding my device upside-down and panning around acts as if my orientation supports Portrait. How can I -completely- turn off anything but Portrait?

@TITLE:Stop newly created dialog from taking focus
@CONTENT:I'm trying to have Java Swing dialog be created but I don't want to have the dialog to take focus away from whatever is currently focused. So for example, if you're editing a word doc and a different application creates a dialog, you should see the dialog but the word doc should remain in focus so that you can keep editing. I've tested the following code on Mac OSX and on Ubuntu 12.04. On Mac, the code creates dialogs that do not take the focus like I want. On Ubuntu, the dialogs take the focus, and I can't type while they are being created. I really hope this isn't operating system specific.

 My console says that both the "zach" and "braden" instance have the exact same attributes, even though I have not set anything to the "braden" instance. If I assign something to the "braden" instance, then they both share the properties of that instance. I think it's a problem related to mutable default argument behavior, but I can't figure out my problem.

@TITLE:In-App Purchase - How to determine if a purchase has already been made?
@CONTENT:Why it's so hard to find out how to do this is beyond me - so maybe I am trying to do this the wrong way - who knows - well hopefully one of you, lol. I have a button that says 'Purchase' (for a non-consumable). If the purchase is successful then update NSUserDefaults purchased = YES and the button is removed. All good up to here. Now when the user deletes the app and wants to reinstall or install on a new device then what I would like to show, in these cases, in place of the 'Purchase' button is a 'Restore' button. 'Restore' button would be clicked and restoreCompletedTransactions would be called. Seems logical to me - user doesn't want to see a 'Purchase' button - they have purchased already. Problem is NSUserDefaults purchased = YES will not be available on re-install or new install. So my question is how do I determine if the app has been purchased before so I can either display a 'Purchase' button or a 'Restore' button. Is there a way to determine if this in-app purchase has already been made by the user? Thanks in advance, Byron.

@CONTENT:I am performing a very simple PL/SQL program for school. It is pretty easy but I think I am missing a concept. I will show what I've been working on and not just ask for an easy answer. I would like to understand the concept of the DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE along with BIND variables that I have declared to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, or a pool to say. I just don't have it declared back properly to the user. I am having trouble finding the correct information on OUTPUT to the user, I am learning a bit more on INPUT and the put_line. So to calc v=lwh. I have declared those variables, put in the put_line, with the dbms_output function built into PL/SQL. I applied the calculation of those variables. I am working on the dbms put line statement back to show the calculation and the concact statements with the variable dimensions displayed and how to best do that. I've seen this program in C language and Ruby but just not in Oracle Developer and PL/SQL.

@LINK:/questions/14666543/d3-js-semantic-zoom-and-pan-example-not-working
@TITLE:D3.js semantic zoom and pan example not working
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement a version of the SVG Semantic Zoom and Pan example for D3.js, found here. I am trying to do this with a Dendrogram / tree (example here), as recommended by Mike Bostock (here). The goal is like this jsFiddle that one of the other threads mentioned, except without the weird node / path unlinking behavior. My personal attempt is located here. I was getting an error in Firebug with Mike's code, about "cannot translate(NaN,NaN)", so I changed the code in the zoom function to what is shown below. However, the behavior is weird. Now 1) my paths don't zoom / move, and 2) I can only pan the nodes from Lower Right--Upper Left (if I try panning from Lower Left--Upper Right, the nodes still move along the LR-UL direction). var vis = d3.select("#tree").append("svg:svg")
              .attr("viewBox", "0 0 600 600")
              .attr("width", w + m[1] + m[3])
              .attr("height", h + m[0] + m[2])
              .append("svg:g")
              .attr("transform", "translate(" + m[3] + "," + m[0] + ")")
              .call(d3.behavior.zoom().x(x).y(y).scaleExtent([1,8]).on("zoom",zoom));

// zoom in / out
function zoom() {
    var nodes = vis.selectAll("g.node");
    nodes.attr("transform", transform);
}

function transform(d) {
    return "translate(" + x(d.y) + "," + y(d.x) + ")";
}
 I tried following the other solutions given in the Google Groups thread mentioned above and the jsFiddle, but I don't make much progress. Including the path links from the jsFiddle in my code and a translate() function lets me scale the paths--except 1) they flip vertically (somewhere x and y transposition isn't working right); 2) the paths don't zoom at the same rate as the nodes (perhaps related to #1), so they become "unlinked"; and 3) when I pan, the paths now pan in all directions, but the nodes don't move. When I click on a node to expand the tree, the paths re-adjust and fix themselves, so the update code seems to work better (but I don't know how to identify / copy the working parts of that). See my code here. function zoom(d) {
    var nodes = vis.selectAll("g.node");
    nodes.attr("transform", transform);

    // Update the links...
    var link = vis.selectAll("path.link");
    link.attr("d", translate);
}

function transform(d) {
    return "translate(" + x(d.y) + "," + x(d.x) + ")";
}

function translate(d) {
    var sourceX = x(d.target.parent.y);
    var sourceY = y(d.target.parent.x);
    var targetX = x(d.target.y);
    var targetY = (sourceX + targetX)/2;
    var linkTargetY = y(d.target.x0);
    var result = "M"+sourceX+","+sourceY+" C"+targetX+","+sourceY+" "+targetY+","+y(d.target.x0)+" "+targetX+","+linkTargetY+"";
    //console.log(result);

   return result;
 My questions are: Are there any working examples of zoom / pan on a Dendrogram / tree that I can look at? With the code I have above, can anyone identify where / how the paths are getting flipped? I have tried various permutations within the translate() function of drawing the SVG Cubic Bezier curve, but nothing seems to work right. Again, my jsFiddle is here. Any troubleshooting tips or ideas why panning only partially works? Thank you everyone for your help!

@CONTENT:I'm trying to upload a file to the apache public_html directory.

 I've tried to set a tmp folder on the server with get_init('/tmp') without any success. Thank you very much for your kind attention.

@CONTENT:I was just wondering if I could get some guidance on an issue I am having with nested for loops in javascript. I currently have the following nested for loop in place for (var i = 0; i <= score; i++)
{
    for (var j = 0; j <= i; j++)
    {
        var stsc = '<img src="./images/star.png"/>';
    }
}
 The aim is to get the variable stsc to show the number of stars depending on the count of the score variable. Currently, it will only show 1 star no matter what the value of score is. I have tried adding stsc outside of the nested loop to no avail. No matter what I do it will show nothing other than 1 star. Could you point me in the right direction as to how to get it to show the correct number of stars (3 stars if score is 3, 0 stars if score is 0 etc...) Thanks everyone

One issue remains unsolved at this moment. I really want to popup a dialog (AlertView) when the conditions are met. At this moment the ALert message is shown at the top of the screen (like a received message or missed call) but I want to present the user with a dialog (like in the clock app) Does anyone knows a solution to this question?

@TITLE:Java server socket sending multiple messages issue
@CONTENT:We have a java socket program where the server gets data from many devices and works fine. At times the server needs to send some command to the devices. When it sends individual commands it works fine. The problem comes when it sends multiple commands, only the first one is successful. We cant figure out why the rest fails. Below is the snippet showing how the message is sent. Should I set a delay after a message is sent? public static void main(String[] args) {   

      new sServer7888();

@TITLE:How do I bind DateTime as DepedencyProperty of a DependencyObject so that it will show up in a textbox?
@CONTENT:I want to learn how to use Dependency Objects and Properties. I have created this class,     public class TestDependency : DependencyObject
    {
        public static readonly DependencyProperty TestDateTimeProperty =
            DependencyProperty.Register("TestDateTime", 
            typeof(DateTime), 
            typeof(TestDependency), 
            new PropertyMetadata(DateTime.Now));

        public DateTime TestDateTime
        {
            get { return (DateTime) GetValue(TestDateTimeProperty); }
            set { SetValue(TestDateTimeProperty, value); }
        }
    }
 The window class is like this public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    private TestDependency td;
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        td = new TestDependency();
        td.TestDateTime = DateTime.Now;
    }
}
 Now I want to use it to show a the current DateTime in the TextBlock which updates itself every second, by adding this to a grid <Grid>
    <TextBlock Text="{Binding TestDateTime,ElementName=td}" Width="200" Height="200"/>
</Grid>
 I can see the TextBlock, but there is no Date Time value in it at all. What am I doing wrong?
@CODE:public class TestDependency : DependencyObject
    {
        public static readonly DependencyProperty TestDateTimeProperty =
            DependencyProperty.Register("TestDateTime",

@TITLE:Merging image from camera with image from drawables
@CONTENT:I?m trying to merge 2 images, one is bitmap from camera, second one is .png file stored in drawables. What I did was that I used both images as bitmaps and I tried to merge them by using canvas, something like this: Bitmap topImage = BitmapFactory.decodeFile("gui.png");
Bitmap bottomImage = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(arg0, 0, arg0.length);

Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bottomImage);
canvas.drawBitmap(topImage, 0, 0, null);
 But I keep getting "Bitmap size exceeds VM budget" error all the time. I tried nearly everything, but still, it keeps throwing this error. Is there another way of merging 2 images? What i need to do is simple - I need to take photo and save it merged with that .PNG image stored in drawables. For example this app is very close to what i need - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hl2.hud&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5obDIuaHVkIl0. Thanks :)

However, how would I run the application using a shortcut, or a jar file? For example, in order to run my WAMP server, I run the wamp.exe file in the WAMP directory. So, I'm running a single file which launches the entire program. How do I achieve this sort of thing with a java application?

@TITLE:Improper iPhone orientation?
@CONTENT:I can't figure out why this isn't working. I'm writing a game that involves scrolling rows/columns of blocks around the screen. I have my orientation limited strictly to Portrait, but it doesn't behave as so. When I call the method below, it is handed the velocity from the pan. Using logs I was able to see that holding my device upside-down and panning around acts as if my orientation supports Portrait. How can I -completely- turn off anything but Portrait? Here's some code to help explain what I want to do, and to hopefully justify my sanity. bool horizontalPan = (fabs(velocity.x) >= (fabs(velocity.y)));
    if (horizontalPan)
    {
        if (fabs(velocity.x) > MAX_VELOCITY)
        {

 My console says that both the "zach" and "braden" instance have the exact same attributes, even though I have not set anything to the "braden" instance. If I assign something to the "braden" instance, then they both share the properties of that instance.

@TITLE:In-App Purchase - How to determine if a purchase has already been made?
@CONTENT:Why it's so hard to find out how to do this is beyond me - so maybe I am trying to do this the wrong way - who knows - well hopefully one of you, lol. I have a button that says 'Purchase' (for a non-consumable). If the purchase is successful then update NSUserDefaults purchased = YES and the button is removed. All good up to here. Now when the user deletes the app and wants to reinstall or install on a new device then what I would like to show, in these cases, in place of the 'Purchase' button is a 'Restore' button. 'Restore' button would be clicked and restoreCompletedTransactions would be called. Seems logical to me - user doesn't want to see a 'Purchase' button - they have purchased already. Problem is NSUserDefaults purchased = YES will not be available on re-install or new install. So my question is how do I determine if the app has been purchased before so I can either display a 'Purchase' button or a 'Restore' button. Is there a way to determine if this in-app purchase has already been made by the user? Thanks in advance, Byron.

I just don't have it declared back properly to the user. I am having trouble finding the correct information on OUTPUT to the user, I am learning a bit more on INPUT and the put_line. So to calc v=lwh. I have declared those variables, put in the put_line, with the dbms_output function built into PL/SQL. I applied the calculation of those variables. I am working on the dbms put line statement back to show the calculation and the concact statements with the variable dimensions displayed and how to best do that. I've seen this program in C language and Ruby but just not in Oracle Developer and PL/SQL.

@LINK:/questions/14666543/d3-js-semantic-zoom-and-pan-example-not-working
@TITLE:D3.js semantic zoom and pan example not working
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement a version of the SVG Semantic Zoom and Pan example for D3.js, found here. I am trying to do this with a Dendrogram / tree (example here), as recommended by Mike Bostock (here). The goal is like this jsFiddle that one of the other threads mentioned, except without the weird node / path unlinking behavior. My personal attempt is located here. I was getting an error in Firebug with Mike's code, about "cannot translate(NaN,NaN)", so I changed the code in the zoom function to what is shown below. However, the behavior is weird. Now 1) my paths don't zoom / move, and 2) I can only pan the nodes from Lower Right--Upper Left (if I try panning from Lower Left--Upper Right, the nodes still move along the LR-UL direction). var vis = d3.select("#tree").append("svg:svg")
              .attr("viewBox", "0 0 600 600")
              .attr("width", w + m[1] + m[3])
              .attr("height", h + m[0] + m[2])
              .append("svg:g")
              .attr("transform", "translate(" + m[3] + "," + m[0] + ")")
              .call(d3.behavior.zoom().x(x).y(y).scaleExtent([1,8]).on("zoom",zoom));

// zoom in / out
function zoom() {
    var nodes = vis.selectAll("g.node");
    nodes.attr("transform", transform);
}

function transform(d) {
    return "translate(" + x(d.y) + "," + y(d.x) + ")";
}
 I tried following the other solutions given in the Google Groups thread mentioned above and the jsFiddle, but I don't make much progress. Including the path links from the jsFiddle in my code and a translate() function lets me scale the paths--except 1) they flip vertically (somewhere x and y transposition isn't working right); 2) the paths don't zoom at the same rate as the nodes (perhaps related to #1), so they become "unlinked"; and 3) when I pan, the paths now pan in all directions, but the nodes don't move. When I click on a node to expand the tree, the paths re-adjust and fix themselves, so the update code seems to work better (but I don't know how to identify / copy the working parts of that). See my code here. function zoom(d) {
    var nodes = vis.selectAll("g.node");
    nodes.attr("transform", transform);

    // Update the links...
    var link = vis.selectAll("path.link");
    link.attr("d", translate);
}

function transform(d) {
    return "translate(" + x(d.y) + "," + x(d.x) + ")";
}

function translate(d) {
    var sourceX = x(d.target.parent.y);
    var sourceY = y(d.target.parent.x);
    var targetX = x(d.target.y);
    var targetY = (sourceX + targetX)/2;
    var linkTargetY = y(d.target.x0);
    var result = "M"+sourceX+","+sourceY+" C"+targetX+","+sourceY+" "+targetY+","+y(d.target.x0)+" "+targetX+","+linkTargetY+"";
    //console.log(result);

   return result;
 My questions are: Are there any working examples of zoom / pan on a Dendrogram / tree that I can look at? With the code I have above, can anyone identify where / how the paths are getting flipped? I have tried various permutations within the translate() function of drawing the SVG Cubic Bezier curve, but nothing seems to work right. Again, my jsFiddle is here. Any troubleshooting tips or ideas why panning only partially works? Thank you everyone for your help!

{
    for (var j = 0; j <= i; j++)
    {
        var stsc = '<img src="./images/star.png"/>';
    }
}
 The aim is to get the variable stsc to show the number of stars depending on the count of the score variable. Currently, it will only show 1 star no matter what the value of score is. I have tried adding stsc outside of the nested loop to no avail. No matter what I do it will show nothing other than 1 star. Could you point me in the right direction as to how to get it to show the correct number of stars (3 stars if score is 3, 0 stars if score is 0 etc...) Thanks everyone

Bitmap bottomImage = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(arg0, 0, arg0.length);

Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bottomImage);
canvas.drawBitmap(topImage, 0, 0, null);
 But I keep getting "Bitmap size exceeds VM budget" error all the time. I tried nearly everything, but still, it keeps throwing this error. Is there another way of merging 2 images?

@CODE:Bitmap topImage = BitmapFactory.decodeFile("gui.png");
Bitmap bottomImage = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(arg0, 0, arg0.length);

Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bottomImage);
canvas.drawBitmap(topImage, 0, 0, null);

@TITLE:PHP generated content inside Javascript breaking script
@CONTENT:I have a website with some Javascript rotating content with a fade. The script works fine until I add a PHP while loop inside it, then it fails. I'm using the PHP to pull content from wordpress posts. here is the isolated code (http://jsfiddle.net/dzz8M/2/). You'll notice the script works as desired if you remove the PHP and you can see here (http://www.smartcallclaims.com/indexx.php/) that the php is outputting fine. When you check the source of that link and look for the JavaScript from the JSfiddle you'll see the PHP has generated it's content inside the script. (I know it adds a <p> tag, this is not the issue) Can some please tell me why the PHP breaks the javascript?

@TITLE:Qt - Obtaining keyboard keycode from QWidget::macEvent()¡¥s EventRef paraneter?
@CONTENT:I am making a Qt application and want to intercept keypresses at a deeper level. To do this I overrided the QWidget::macEvent() function to intercept the EventRef parameter. For different events (i.e. keyboard events, mouse events, window events) EventRef is equal to the following values: 0¡Ñ104d649f0
0¡Ñ101425740
0¡Ñ104d649f0
0¡Ñ101485950
0¡Ñ101425740
0¡Ñ101485950
 How can I tell if the event is a keyboard event? And how can I find out which key was pressed? I¡¦ve looked at event handling documentation and most of them don¡¦t mention EventRef. Some articles mention how EventRef is the Carbon event derived from the Cocoa NSEvent event.

@TITLE:Projective Z-value of a real-world point in three.js
@CONTENT:I want to find the de-normalized projective Z-value for some world point. I am currently able to get the projective X,Y values by doing what mrdoob shows here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11605007 That example shows how to de-normalize the projective X,Y (taking it from the range [-1, 1] into actual screen coordinates). It does not show how to de-normalize the projective Z. These projective Z values also are in the range of [-1, 1] but I don't know how to de-normalize them. To frame the question in code, building on mrdoob's answer above: var width = 640, height = 480;
var widthHalf = width / 2, heightHalf = height / 2;

var projector = new THREE.Projector();
// this could be any point; using example from mrdoob's answer
var someWorldPoint = object.matrixWorld.getPosition().clone();
var vector = projector.projectVector(someWorldPoint, camera );

vector.x = ( vector.x * widthHalf ) + widthHalf;
vector.y = - ( vector.y * heightHalf ) + heightHalf;
// what does vector.z represent and how do I de-normalize vector.z?
 Thanks for your help. If any of my terminology is incorrect or confusing please correct it.

 The RSS file will not load when I use the code above. I even echoed $url to make sure that it has a link assigned to it. However, if I put the actual url into the load(), it works just fine. Why isn't $url working in load()?

@CONTENT:So I've been looking for the answer to this problem for ages and cannot find a solution. The error is: Invalid parameter number: number of bound variables does not match number of tokens
 and of course I know what this error means, but I don't understand why it's actually throwing it only when I surround something in single quotes. Here's my code: $query = "UPDATE $DbTableName SET name=':name' WHERE id=:Id";
$result = $dbc->prepare($query); //Prepare query

$values = array('Id' => $Id, 'name' => $name); //Prepare values
$result->execute($values); //Execute Query
 see the single quotes around :name If I remove these quotes then there's no PDO error, but a MySQL error because a string needs to be surrounded by single quotes.. How can I get around this? MySQL error when setting name to bob without quotes: #1054 - Unknown column 'bob' in 'field list'
 Thanks in advance

@TITLE:Alternative between parser rule and lexer rule
@CONTENT:The question is buried in the update section of another question, now specifically ask it. I am using antlr3.4. I have a simple grammar trying to parse 2 types of text, the line started with "#include" and others. Here is my grammar: cmds
    : cmd+
    ;

cmd
    : include_cmd |  other_cmd
    ;

include_cmd
    : INCLUDE  DOUBLE_QUOTE  FILE_NAME  DOUBLE_QUOTE

other_cmd

INCLUDE

DOUBLE_QUOTE
    : '"'
    ;

FILE_NAME

New_Line 
    : ('\r' | '\n')+   
    ;

WS 
    : ('\t' | ' ')+  {$channel = HIDDEN;}
    ;
 But I get such warning: Decision can match input such as "{DOUBLE_QUOTE..FILE_NAME, New_Line..WS}" using multiple alternatives: 1, 2

As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
 I guess this is because a double quote can match both other_cmd rule and DOUBLE_QUOTE rule, but I am wondering here, one is parser rule and the other is lexer rule, does this warning make sense? Any help to clear this warning? A side question - the warning message just says alternative 1,2, but it is not immediately clear to me what is 1 and what is 2, is there a way to render antlr to give more direct alternatives?
@CODE:cmds

    : include_cmd |  other_cmd
    ;

include_cmd
    : INCLUDE  DOUBLE_QUOTE  FILE_NAME  DOUBLE_QUOTE

WS 
    : ('\t' | ' ')+  {$channel = HIDDEN;}
    ; Decision can match input such as "{DOUBLE_QUOTE..FILE_NAME, New_Line..WS}" using multiple alternatives: 1, 2

As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input

@TITLE:Separate out array based on array data
@CONTENT:I want to create a table for documents and allow users to select whether the document is required or not in relation to a task. I need it to check the current status of the document to see if it is already required and if it is mark the tick box as checked. There are currently 4 documents in the database and only 2 associations to 2 of the documents for this particular task. When there is no association of a document to a task there will be no entry in the database to say that it is not associated it just simple will not be in that table. The code I have currently will show checkboxes against those 2 documents which have associations however do not show any tick boxes at all for the ones that have no association. I would like it to still show the 3 check boxes, so that the user can change its association, but as default it should check not required. Currently It just shows no tick boxes at all. Below is the PHP snip. Please advise if you would like a screenshot or the DB dumps. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm hoping its just been a long day and I am forgetting something simple.     <table border=1>

 So far I have just tried tweaking the requirement = with the final tick box. But as it is staying the same whether i use NULL ect - im guessing im missing something. Kind Regards, n00bstacker

 The jsfiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/e6shF/40/. In Firefox, you are unable to highlight the numeric text box value. In Chrome, you can highlight the value but can't type over the value while it is highlighted. It appears to be a focus issue due to improper z-indexing. I'm using kendo version 2012.3.1114 (latest GPL release). This issue is no longer present in kendo version 2012.3.1315 but that version doesn't appear to be available under GPL. How can I resolve this issue using kendo 2012.3.1114?

@TITLE:Java object added to ArrayList not showing
@CONTENT:I have two Classes: Class1 which contains an ArrayList of type Class2 When I try to add a new object as follow: Class2 object = new Class2();
Class1Object.getArrayList().add(object);
 Then it appears that the object has been added when I iterate over getArrayList() However I have another ArrayList of type class1 and when I iterate over this there object added does not appear? I thought that since objects are by reference it should be added to the ArrayList of type class1. Can any one explain this please? public class Subject implements Serializable {

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
private String subjectName;
private int hours;
private int mins;
private ArrayList<Task> tasks;
private SimpleDateFormat date;

public Subject(String subjectName){
    this.subjectName = subjectName;
    hours = 0;
    mins = 0;
    tasks = new ArrayList<Task>();
    date = null;
}


public ArrayList<Task> getTasks() {
    return tasks;
}
 } public class Task implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 2L;
    private String description;
    private boolean isCompleted;

    public Task(String description){
        this.description = description;
        isCompleted = false;
    }   

}
 So then I have: ArrayList<Subject> subjectsList = new ArrayList<Subject>();
 And then I want to add a new task to a given subject so I do: Task task = new Task(description);
ArrayList<Task> taskList = subject.getTasks();
taskList.add(task);
 And when I iterate over subject.getTasks(); its there but when I iterate over subjectsList the new task is not there anymore. Here is the first loop which shows the new task: for (Task task : subject.getTasks()){
   System.out.println( task.toString() );
}
 And the code for iterating over all objects from subjectsList for (Subject s : subjectsList){
 for (Task t : s.getTasks()){
   System.out.println( t.toString() );
    }
}



Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();
  if (bundle != null) {
    subject = (Subject) bundle.get("selected_subject");
    subjectsList = (ArrayList<Subject>) bundle.get("subjects_list");

I can grab the data from the database using this code, which works... but don't no how to go about getting it to do what I want it to do... <option value=". $row['1'] .">". $row['1'].    "</option>

Here is a mockup of the site that I'm speaking about: http://eitanrosenberg.com/tests/pop/bootstrap/ It looks ok at first, but when the browser is resized, the sidebars get really small and there is a ton of white space. Why is this? Thank you so much in advance.

@TITLE:Change drop down selected item based on selected item of another drop down list
@CONTENT:I have two drop down lists on my ASP.NET MVC 3. When one of the drop down lists is set to "Sole Proprietor", the other needs to be set to the same.

@TITLE:How to make an Active Directory query from VBScript on a non-domain computer using domain credentials
@CONTENT:I am writing a VBScript which will run on a computer that is not yet a member of the domain but needs to make a query against Active Directory to check a group's membership (as a step in the build process while re-imaging a computer). The script will have access to the credentials (i.e., user name and password) for a domain user account when it runs. At the point in the script where this query is made against Active Directory, how can I use the domain credentials in order to authenticate and have the query succeed? Please note: The domain does not support anonymous queries. In How Can I Run a Script Under Alternate Credentials? (Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog), I found sample code which would work if I already knew the distinguished name of the computer: Const ADS_SECURE_AUTHENTICATION = 1
Const ADS_USE_ENCRYPTION = 2

strAdsiPath = "LDAP://" & strDistinguishedName ' But I don't know the DN yet
strUser = "domain\user"
strPassword = "password"

Set objDso = GetObject("LDAP:")
Set objComputer = objDso.OpenDSObject(strAdsiPath, _
                                      strUser, _
                                      strPassword, _
                                      ADS_USE_ENCRYPTION OR ADS_SECURE_AUTHENTICATION)
 From there, I could examine the objComputer variable to find the group membership. In an answer to Secure LDAP object manipulation with VBscript using alternate credentials, there is also sample code which will work as long as the LDAP path to the object is known. Since I don't know a way to get the distinguished name of the computer before I've successfully authenticated, I can't see how to use code like the sample above. Is there another method other than OpenDSObject() which will allow me to pass credentials, or another way for me to get the distinguished name?
@CODE:Const ADS_SECURE_AUTHENTICATION = 1
Const ADS_USE_ENCRYPTION = 2

strAdsiPath = "LDAP://" & strDistinguishedName ' But I don't know the DN yet
strUser = "domain\user"
strPassword = "password"

@TITLE:Permission issue when setting background color in google spreadsheet
@CONTENT:I have a script in Google Docs that sets the background color of a row if the Status column contains a certain value. The problem is that the worksheet has certain protected columns, so when a restricted user triggers the script on his section, it runs, but they get an obnoxious permission error message (because the script colors parts of the protected columns). So I need to create 2 scripts that color the row in chunks so when a restricted user triggers individualized status messages, only their unprotected columns color. Here's the code that colors the whole row (triggered by installable onedit trigger): function setBackLogColor() {

 var range = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet().getDataRange();
 var statusColumnOffset = getStatusColumnOffset();

for (var i = range.getRow(); i < range.getLastRow(); i++) { 
 rowRange = range.offset(i, 0, 1);
 status = rowRange.offset(0, statusColumnOffset).getValue();

if (status == 'TO LD') 
{
  rowRange.setBackgroundColor("#cfe2f3");
} 
else if (status == 'TO GB' ) 
{
  rowRange.setBackgroundColor("#d9ead3");
} 
else if (status == 'TO OUTSIDE PARTY - WILL COME BACK' ) 
{
  rowRange.setBackgroundColor("#f4cccc");
} 
 else if (status == 'Hand Delivery 2' ) 
{
  rowRange.setBackgroundColor("#d9ead3");
} 
 else if (status == 'Hand Delivery' ) 
{
  rowRange.setBackgroundColor("#cfe2f3");
} 
else 
{
  rowRange.setBackgroundColor("#FFFFFF");
}
 }
}

//Returns the offset value of the column titled "Status"
//(eg, if the 7th column is labeled "Status", this function returns 6)
function getStatusColumnOffset() {
lastColumn = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet().getLastColumn();
var range = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet().getRange(1,1,1,lastColumn);

for (var i = 0; i < range.getLastColumn(); i++) {
if (range.offset(0, i, 1, 1).getValue() == "Status") {
  return i;
}  
}
}

@TITLE:Insert with Hibernate with child objects does not return full object
@CONTENT:I am using Spring 3.2 and hibernate-core 4.1.4 and hibernate-jpa-2.0.1. The application resource file has all the correct objects. I have a child object RoleEntity, and it has two parents: User and Award, so the userId and the awardId are foreign-keys that already exist, and MUST exist for the role entity to be created. public class RoleEntity implements Serializable

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "award_id")
    private AwardEntity award;

}
 My DAO insert looks very simple: @Override
public RoleEntity saveRoleEntity(RoleEntity role)
{
     logger.debug("saveRoleEntity: role=" + role);
     return role;
}
 I have unit tested this code, and I can confirm that when I select an existing roleId, I can fully get back the loaded object, with User and Award fully populated. However, when I insert new role, I do the following: set roleId to 0, and the role description ... create a userEntity and set the id only, this id already exists and is not new create a awardEntity and set the id only, this id already exists and is not new I can successfully do a save and this is great!!!! Works for me. And in the new object return, I can clearly see the new roleId is returned to me!!! All the other fields to RoleEntity, like the description, that is there. But, what I ALSO want is for the User and Award fields of the RoleEntity to be fully populated as if I had done a select after the insert. Is this even possible? I would prefer to not do a select to the user and award tables to get those objects and then assign them to this object, but if I have to do that, then that's fine. If I need to provide any more information, please let me know. Thanks for any help in advance.

@TITLE:How can I convert this into a integer in Javascript?
@CONTENT:I asked a similar question yesterday .. If I have for example 0-9999 , how can I turn this into 09999 , basically removing the - and make it an integer in javascript ? var = 0-9999 turn that into 9999 integer or var = 2-9999 , turn that into 29999 Thanks a bunch
@CODE:var x = "2-9999" var x = 2-9999 -9997

@TITLE:Getting fb friends likes with ¡§Friends¡¨ privacy in Graph API
@CONTENT:Earlier to get my facebook friends "likes" I used such requests to graph API: https://graph.facebook.com/<friend_id>?fields=likes.fields(created_time,id,name,category)&access_token=?

https://graph.facebook.com/<friend_id>/likes?fields=created_time,id,name,category&access_token=?
 Now for about two weeks I can't do it if my friends "likes" are not "Public" (such as "Friends", "Only me", etc.). And these requests return only "likes" with "Public" privacy. Can you give any advice how to solve this problem ? Maybe I should set some special options for my application ?

@TITLE:How do I use tab completion in Rstudio
@CONTENT:I've been using Rstudio for a few weeks now, and the tab completion has worked inconsistently for me. For example: my_variable = 10
my_va
 Those are the only two lines in my R-script. When I press tab to use completion, a small message appears next to the text bar saying "(No matches)", when I believe it should find the matching variable called "my_variable" in the line above. Does anyone know how to use tab completion in Rstudio?

@TITLE:Transform cube on to surface of sphere in openGL
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on a game which renders a textured sphere (representing Earth) and cubes representing player models (which will be implemented later). When a user clicks a point on the sphere, the cube is translated from the origin (0,0,0) (which is also the center of the sphere) to the point on the surface of the sphere. The problem is that I want the cube to rotate so as to sit with it's base flat on the sphere's surface (as opposed to just translating the cube). What the best way is to calculate the rotation matrices about each axis in order to achieve this effect?

@TITLE:jnlp file is prompting mac to download JRE, but its already installed (Java 1.6.0_37) Mac OSX 10.7.5
@CONTENT:I don't even really know what to post in here except for the fact that the terminal on the computer says: java version "1.6.0_37"

Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.12-b01-434, mixed mode)
 but for some reason when i run the JNLP file a prompt pops up saying that to open this web start application I need to download the Java Runtime Environment. Which I already did. It originally installed Java 7, and after doing some research I discovered that this jnlp file won't open with Java 7 installed. So I went back and removed Java 7, and now this is happening. If I open the Java Preferences window, I can see that Java SE 6 is indeed installed. I just have no idea what to do. EDIT: The terminal says No Java runtime present, requesting install. Unable to locate a Java Runtime to invoke.

@LINK:/questions/14654004/parsing-json-ajax-response
@TITLE:Parsing JSON Ajax response
@CONTENT:I'm running into trouble parsing a JSON response. I've done this lots of times but this is not working for a reason I cannot discern. Here is what I'm doing: Before anyone suggests it - due to some requirements of the project I am working on I have to use the server side Google Geocoding web service, I can't do it all client side. I'm using PHP for the server side portion. I'm using AJAX(via jQuery) to send the location to the server, getting the response and returning it encoded as JSON. Here is the server side code: <?php
if(!empty($_POST['theLocation']))
{
    $loc = urlencode($_POST['theLocation']);

    $response = file_get_contents("http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=$loc,+CA&sensor=false");
    echo  json_encode($response);
}
?>
 Here is the client side call, where theLocation is a location name:  var postdata = "theLocation=" + encodeURIComponent(theLocation);
$.ajax( {
    type : "POST",
    url : "GeoEncode.php",
    data :postdata ,
    dataType : "JSON",
    success : function(data) {
        data = $.parseJSON(data);

        lat = data.results[0].geometry.location.lat;
        lng = data.results[0].geometry.location.lng;

    },
    error: function (request, status, error) {
        log("Error: getLatLong Status - " + status + " ErrorText - " + error);
    }
});
 When I try to access data.results[0] I get the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined. This obviously means that there is no results property. However if I do a console.log(data) This is what I get: {

 This is valid JSON, there is clearly a results property. I don't know why I am having trouble with this, I must be missing something but through my debugging I have yet to find out what. If anyone could offer any suggestions it would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:animation in JTable
@CONTENT:I am trying to put gif image(animated) to a JTable cell, but it's not being displayed. As I have read, JTable component is static and it's required to rewrite rendering. The point is that I have a thread which calculates some data and pastes it to a table cell, while calculating I want to display some rotating wheel. Moreover, I add rows to the table from another separate thread. So, one thread adds a row with some data and another thread calculates data for a cell in the row. Is it possible to add an animation icon into the same cell in each added row? Has anyone ideas how to do it?

@LINK:/questions/14653940/using-requestparam-for-multiple-post-parameters
@TITLE:Using @RequestParam for multiple POST-Parameters
@CONTENT:I have a very similiar problem solved in this thread: click To make a long story short: I'm generating form elements dynamically with jQuery and in the result it looks like this: <div id="XYZ-1">
<input type="text" id="XYZ-1-position" name="XYZ-1-position" style="width: 20px;"/>
<input type="text" id="XYZ-1-input" name="XYZ-1-value" style="width: 400px;"/>
</div>

<div id="XYZ-2">
<input type="text" id="XYZ-2-position" name="XYZ-2-position" style="width: 20px;"/>
<input type="text" id="XYZ-2-input" name="XYZ-2-value" style="width: 400px;"/>
</div>
 So for handling one form field, I'm using just this simple @ReqeustParam:      @RequestMapping(value = "/data", method = RequestMethod.POST)
 public String myHandler(@RequestParam("XYZ-1-value")String content, Model model) {

    model.addAttribute("dataset", content); 
            return "data"
 In the Thread of the beginning of my post it is solved like: public String controllerMethod(@RequestParam(value="myParam[]") String[] myParams){
....
}
 And this works for input types with the same name: <input type="checkbox" name="myParam[]" value="myVal1" />
<input type="checkbox" name="myParam[]" value="myVal2" />
 But the difference to my problem is, that my form elements do NOT have the same name - each has an individual Name. So my question is how I can handle these individual post-parameters in a single handler in my controller. Thanks in advance
@CODE:<div id="XYZ-1">
<input type="text" id="XYZ-1-position" name="XYZ-1-position" style="width: 20px;"/>
<input type="text" id="XYZ-1-input" name="XYZ-1-value" style="width: 400px;"/>
</div>

<div id="XYZ-2">
<input type="text" id="XYZ-2-position" name="XYZ-2-position" style="width: 20px;"/>
<input type="text" id="XYZ-2-input" name="XYZ-2-value" style="width: 400px;"/>
</div> @RequestMapping(value = "/data", method = RequestMethod.POST)
 public String myHandler(@RequestParam("XYZ-1-value")String content, Model model) {

    model.addAttribute("dataset", content); 
            return "data" public String controllerMethod(@RequestParam(value="myParam[]") String[] myParams){
....
} <input type="checkbox" name="myParam[]" value="myVal1" />
<input type="checkbox" name="myParam[]" value="myVal2" />

<div class="panel">Panel 3</div>

 Is there a way to load Panel 1, then once that has loaded, load Panel 2 and so on... With most solutions I've looked at, they have suggested loading the content through an external file using the .load() method in jQuery. If anybody has any advice and/or examples or example code that would be AMAZING.

@CONTENT:I wish to store certain pieces of code in database tables as templates but I am unsure as to whether they are going to create problems or not. I keep reading mixed messages from various different people in different posts and I am just not happy that I am clear on this subject. I have already worked out that you cannot really echo/ print PHP into a webpage. Obviously you can echo strings of HTML but it becomes awkward when you try to do it with PHP code. The only way I have managed to do this is through eval which is apparently bad in most cases... so I am using another method to implement the templates (i.e. writing a php file to be used as an include file) The main question I am asking is: is there really a problem with storing the PHP code strings (which include SQL statements) inside text type fields (mediumtext, longtext etc) in tables? Could those SQL statements ever do anything like execute actual actions or would they just remain as text strings? Just to clarify, the reason I am storing strings of code is because they are templates to be used should the web administrator wish to allocate them to a specific area (div) of the pages.

@LINK:/questions/14652531/jquery-ajax-gets-fired-on-load-instead-of-on-blur
@TITLE:jquery ajax gets fired on load instead of on blur
@CONTENT:I have a function called applyToDetailRows, which I call on load, as well as when the input section of my page gets re-drawn via ajax. this function, attaches a bunch of events to the input fields that get drawn. One of the events on a field is blur, which triggers an ajax call to fetch student info. The problem is that the blur ajax trigger fires every time the page loads for each field, rather than firing on blur. And this only happens if the function is defined inside of applyToDetailRows. If I pull it out of applyToDetailRows, it works fine. one thing to note is that I also have auto-complete defined in applyToDetailRows in the similar manner, and it works fine. But not this.     function applyToDetailRows() {
        $(":input[data-getstudent]").each(function() {
            $(this).on('blur', function () {
                var elem = this;
                $.ajax({
                    url: $(elem).attr('data-getstudent'),
                    dataType: "json",

@TITLE:Add validation message in fieldset instead of js popup
@CONTENT:I have a php app, that has been pieced together, but I am working on an crazy validation piece, that i've got working. At the end of the validation, the following function runs and gives me a popup with the listed of required fields. function showReqFlds(emptyFlds) {
    for (var i = 0; i < emptyFlds.length; i++) {
    var holdErrMsgs = emptyFlds[i]+' is required.' + "\n";

    }
        alert(holdErrMsgs);
}
 Works great, but now I want instead of the javascript popup box, I want the error messages to appear in a fieldset at the top of my form. Steps: User opens form, error fieldset is not displaying User clicks the submit button to submit form, but has not filled in a couple of the required fields Error fieldset appears, shows required field list, form is not submitted. Any assistance would be appreciate. Thank you.

I use: <a href="{{page.previous.url}}" title="Previous Post: {{page.previous.title}}">
{{page.previous.title}}</a>
 To navigate between posts, and: {% for post in site.posts limit: 5 %}
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>

@TITLE:HTML5 video within time frame
@CONTENT:So I am working on an interactive HTML5 video player, and currently have everything working while using popcorn.js, but I am now trying to go back and make my player work without being dependent on popcorn.js. When working with popcorn.js, you can use code like: popcorn.code((
    start: 0,
    end: 5,
    onStart: function( options ) {
        //put code here
    }
}}
 and your code will be executed when the time of your video spans from 0 through 5. Now, I am trying to have certain blocks of code executed within a certain timeframe of the video, but i can't seem to get it working right and was just wondering if someone can see where i am going about this wrong. while (myVideo.currentTime >= 0 && myVideo.currentTime <= 5)
{
    console.log(myVideo.currentTime);
}
 This while loop is also running so fast that it causes the browser to slow down and freeze. However, if i try using an if loop instead of a while loop, it (obviously) only checks it once.
@CODE:popcorn.code((
    start: 0,
    end: 5,

    }
}} while (myVideo.currentTime >= 0 && myVideo.currentTime <= 5)

@CONTENT:I'm in dire need of help with this project. I'm trying to implement a Bag class for a programming assignment, and I'm getting hung up on the addAll(), Union(), and equals(), methods. Edit: According to the assignment, addAll() is supposed to add all of the the objects from the second array into the first. I'm no longer getting an error when I run it, but for some reason it will not add all of the elements from the second array, it will only add the first 2. Thanks guys, this one is working perfectly now! Edit: For Union(), I'm supposed to create a third bag that will contain all the contents of the first 2 bags. I was getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when running this method. I've updated the code following biddulph.r and it's also working great. Thanks again! Edit: "First attempt" And for equals(), it's supposed to check the size of the bags to make sure they are equal in size, then check to see if they contain the same numbers. So as it's written now, my equals() method will compare sizes and return the boolean value for that, but I'm unsure of how to make it compare the actual values. import java.util.Arrays;
import javax.swing.*;

@LINK:/questions/14650946/how-to-parse-text-from-multiple-strings
@TITLE:How to parse text from multiple strings?
@CONTENT:I am using a terminal emulator library to create a terminal and then I use it to send the data entered over serial to a serial device. When the data is sent back I want to parse it and show the most important information to the user in an editText. Currently I receive byte arrays/chunks and I convert them to a string. When I get a \r or a \n I crete a new string and the process repeats. This is fine for most commands, however some commands return results over multiple lines like "show vlan" here: When I loop through this I get a string for each line. The first would contain VLAN Name Status and Ports, as an example. So now I have a problem, how can I VLAN 1 has x ports active. They are in different strings. Here is the code and screenshot for a current easier command where I am interested in one line: Handler viewHandler = new Handler();
Runnable updateView = new Runnable() {
    @Override

    public void run() {

        mEmulatorView.invalidate();

        if (statusBool == true) {
            for (int i = 0; i < dataReceived.length(); i++) {
                parseCommand = parseCommand + dataReceived.charAt(i);

 if (dataReceived.charAt(i) == '\n' || dataReceived.charAt(i) == '\r'){

    if(parseCommand.contains("KlasOS"))
            {

        String[] tokens = parseCommand.split("\\s{1,}");

        final String ReceivedText = mReceiveBox.getText().toString() + " "
        + new String("Software Version: " + tokens[1] + "\n" );

        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                                mReceiveBox.setText(ReceivedText);
                                mReceiveBox.setSelection(ReceivedText.length());

                            }
                        });         

                            }

                parseCommand = "";

            }               
            }

            statusBool = false;
            viewHandler.postDelayed(updateView, 1000);
        }
    }
};
 Now I would like to change this so i can deal with multiple lines. Would the ebst way be to store strings if they contain certain information? I need this outputted on the right hand editText: "The following ports are on vlan 1: Fa1/0, fa1/1, fa1/2, fa1/3, fa1/4, fa1/5, fa1/6, fa1/7, fa1/8, fa1/9, fa1/10, fa1/11, Gi0"

            for (int i = 0; i < dataReceived.length(); i++) {
                parseCommand = parseCommand + dataReceived.charAt(i);

 if (dataReceived.charAt(i) == '\n' || dataReceived.charAt(i) == '\r'){

    if(parseCommand.contains("KlasOS"))
            {

        String[] tokens = parseCommand.split("\\s{1,}");

        final String ReceivedText = mReceiveBox.getText().toString() + " "
        + new String("Software Version: " + tokens[1] + "\n" );

        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                                mReceiveBox.setText(ReceivedText);
                                mReceiveBox.setSelection(ReceivedText.length());

                            }

                            }

                parseCommand = "";

            }               
            }

@LINK:/questions/14650354/is-it-possible-to-put-focus-on-frame-after-trigger-to-open-frame-is-invoked-a-se
@TITLE:Is it possible to put focus on frame after trigger to open frame is invoked a second time (Firefox)?
@CONTENT:I am having an issue in firefox. My research so far is telling me that there is not really a reliable way to deal with my problem, but I am wanting to ask just in case. I have the following javascript/jquery to open a new window triggered by pressing a button on my page: alipayTransactionModalTrigger.click(function() {
     NIWindow=window.open("<!--ALIPAY_CONF_REDIRECT_URL-->", "NI payment");
     alipayTransactionModal.dialog("open");
  });
 In Chrome and Firefox, this opens a new frame, and the frame gets focus. This is fine. However, if a user leaves this new frame open, and comes back to my original page. They are able to hit the button to trigger this event again. If this occurs, the new frame reloads as it should, but in Firefox the new frame does NOT pull focus this on this refresh. I am not sure why it would pull focus on the initial new frame load, but not pull focus if the frame is refreshed with the same event trigger. I haven't had the courage yet to check this in IE... Is this one of those things that you cannot reliably control? Or is there a way to do this? Note, I have tried using NIWindow.focus() after the initial window open line of code above. No luck. I believe I read something about possibly using alerts, but I was not sure how to implement the described solution, and I read that it was a bit of a hacky solution. I could just always open a new window "_blank", and that would assure focus, but the newly opened frame url uses parameters that are based on the parent window. I have no access to that code, so there is no way for me to add checks to make sure data matches up, until I get a response back from this redirect

     NIWindow=window.open("<!--ALIPAY_CONF_REDIRECT_URL-->", "NI payment");

@TITLE:Apache-to-PSGI proxy over a Unix domain socket
@CONTENT:We have many (isolated) installations of a PSGI app that run on the same machine and thus require their PSGI servers to run on unique ports. This is less than ideal from a resource/management perspective, but it also requires the (yet-unmeasured and possibly insignificant) "overhead" of TCP/IP when a Unix domain socket would seem to be more obvious choice when running on the same machine. Fortunately, the app works under Plack's HTTP interface (proxied from Apache via mod_proxy's "ProxyPass"), but unfortunately, it breaks under the FastCGI interface (see: Can PSGI apps fork() under Plack::Handler::FCGI?). Other than mod_fastcgi's FastCgiExternalServer (or patching mod_proxy with this untested, user-contributed patch: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201207.mbox/%3C20120731200351.GB11038@gmail.com%3E), is there any way to proxy Apache connections over a Unix domain socket to a PSGI app?

@TITLE:Accessing value from bean:write in value attribute of logic:equal Struts
@CONTENT:I'm developing an application using Struts 1.3.10 I need to iterate 2 lists in order to print the result in jsp. The first list iteration needs to be used to select elements from list 2. For that reason I'm trying to do like this:  <logic:iterate name="bodyForm" property="domainList" id="domList">
     <div><h1><bean:write name="domList" property="domain"/><h1>
          <ul> <logic:iterate name="bodyForm" property="locationsList" id="locList" >
                   <logic:equal name="locList" property="domain" value="<bean:write name="domList" property="domain"/>" >

               </logic:iterate>
           </ul>
     </div>
</logic:iterate>
 But, when I call "bean:write" inside value of "logic:equal" I get an error. Do you know how to solve it? As you sugest me I have used JSTL tags to get the solution, but in the source code of the web page I have this result:     <h1>domList.domain</h1>

myLoader.load(new URLRequest("http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml"));
 myLoader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, processXML);

function processXML(e:Event):void {
myXML = new XML(e.target.data);
trace(myXML.*);
}
 With this I get the whole xml document as an output. How can I adress the various "cube currency" and "rate" values within as3? Thanks for your help!
@CODE:var myXML:XML;

@TITLE:jQuery Datatables Column list rendering behind the jQuery Modal Dialog
@CONTENT:I have a jQuery modal dialog in which I am rendering a datatable. I am required to use the ColVis plugin in order to dynamically show or hide columns of this datatable. The problem is that when I click on the Show/Hide Columns button, the column list does not render on the modal dialog. It renders behind it! I have to close the dialog in order to see this list. The same thing when implemented in a normal page(without a modal dialog) works absolutely fine. Any idea how to fix this modal dialog problem?

@TITLE:Orbeon Single sign-on to SAP Netweaver
@CONTENT:We have setup Orbeon 4.0 beta 3 on SAP Netweaver 7.3 with custom persistancy layer. This layer is created on Netweaver with this in mind: http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/form-runner/persistence-api Basic CXF webservices which acts as a proxy to the SAP Backend where we store the form and data. Connection to the backend is made via SAP HTTPDestination. This setup works as long as authentication is turn off in web.xml etc. The next step was to enable this with SSO in mind. So that the persistancy layer is called with the same SSO ticket to enable usercontext passing to the SAP backend. Steps: Enable security in orbeon web.xml and web-j2ee-engine with proper SAP role and login stack (ticket) Enable security on the persistency layer Setup orbeon to pass the MYSAPSSO2 cookie (property as="xs:string" name="oxf.http.forward-cookies" value="MYSAPSSO2"/>) Looking at the browser window I see the JSESSIONID and MYSAPSSO2 cookies. This is supported by java filter I made in front of Orbeon to read the cookies. This filter in front of the Orbeon loops over the Cookie[] array of the Servlet request. I have 3 log records of this and what caught my eye was that the JSESSION of the first log record looked like this Cookie: JSESSIONID   0iqTevo1vDb_lYFwTa-9CJHymaGMPAHaCk0A_SAPox1Z6aY-RvYBtiK-2U5GLmAh
 the following records did look like this: Cookie: JSESSIONID   0iqTevo1vDb_lYFwTa-9CJHymaGMPAHaCk0A_SAP
 So first question is why the trim of the JSESSIONID? Looking at the logs of the percistancy layer this class shows an error: com.sap.engine.services.security.authentication.loginmodule.ticket
Base64 Encoded Ticket String: 0iqTevo1vDb_lYFwTa-9CJHymaGMPAHaCk0A_SAP
 It looks to me that SAP can handle this shorter JSESSIONID. A test via browser: Open Orbeon forms url Log into SAP by the login page shown Open the /rest/test (url of the persistancy layer) to see if I have to login again No login required when opening /rest/test and no errors in the login regarding com.sap.engine.services.security.authentication.loginmodule.ticket

@CONTENT:I was wondering, I have made a php plugin for wordpress which asks as an image store. If you login you see the files which you have been assigned. Then you click download and it downloads them. The trouble is, if you know the URL you can download the image regardless. How can I easily stop users from downloading the image if they know its unique URL, and instead only allow those people who have login permission to view it. The ideas I have are either: Some kind of HTACCESS hack which checks the refering URL A kind of KEY system, which only allows the file to be downloaded if a key is supplied. Any information or ideas would be really useful, thank you.

@TITLE:Drag and Drop Across Windows
@CONTENT:I have a page that loads and then that page's JavaScript opens a popup window that will become a gallery. The user will upload images, using JavaScript and PHP that is part of the popup gallery window, and these uploaded images will be displayed in the gallery window that we popped up Once several images have been uploaded and displayed in the gallery window I would like to drag and drop them into the primary window. Actually I'd like to leave the image in the gallery and just drag a ghost image across and drop it in the main window, so we end with the image in both windows. This seems a bit tricky since the main widow and the popup gallery window are different JavaScript execution contexts. How can I implement a jQuery (or YUI) Drag and Drop that works from the popup window to the main window? Thanks for any ideas.

@TITLE:phpmyadmin #2054 cannot log in to the mysql server
@CONTENT:I am a newbie in MySQL, Apache, PHP, and phpMyAdmin. The first server I built was on Windows Vista x32bit and it was successful. Then, I try to build the second server on another laptop, it is Windows 7 x64bit and it stucked in error code #2054. I use 'localhost' with a fixed IP address. I installed the server individually from .msi files, NOT a package installer. After I enter my 'root' and my 'password', then I clicked 'Go', it popped up two error messages, one is "#2054 Cannot log in to the MySQL server" and another is "Connection for controluser as defined in your configuration failed." I searched many resources online, but out of luck. How can I solve these two errors? Any info in helpful. Thanks in advance. Below is my config.inc.php: enter code here <?php

@CONTENT:i want to extend the UserController with an setEventManager implementation, to display another layout - just with an login mask. When i call the url www.example.com i get my Controller, with the other layout. But if type in a wrong username, i redirected to www.exmpale.com/user/login and i get the default layout. How i can overwrite all routes from ZfcUser Module and redirect them to my own controller, to ensure, the UserController can not called directly. Thank you.

@TITLE:Counting and grouping same named column in different tables (where clause from only one table)
@CONTENT:Okay my question is similar to Counting and grouping same named column in different tables (mysql) but since it might help people looking for exact solution on the internet (like me) I am separating the two questions. So my table looks similar to that in the link above, with some new columns Table 1: id age gender published
1   10  M       1
2   11  F       1
3   11  F       0
 Table 2: id table1id age gender
1    2       11   F
2    2       12   M
3    3       12   M
 I want to count and group rows from both tables where published = 1. For the second table it should check the published value from the row given by table1id in Table 1. Table1id is the id of the row in Table 1 denoting that table 2 is a subset of table 1. So the result should look something like the following: age count
10  1
11  2
12  1
 Notice that third row from table 1 is not counted because published is 0. And third row from table 2 is not counted because table1id = 3, which means it's a subset of the 3rd row of table 1 (which has published = 0) Thanks for your help :)
@CODE:id age gender published
1   10  M       1
2   11  F       1
3   11  F       0 id table1id age gender
1    2       11   F
2    2       12   M

@TITLE:Javascript style object converts complex color names into rgb
@CONTENT:Is there a way to override how javascript converts complex CSS color names to rgb values when applying them to DOM elements in the document.getElementById(xxx).style object. For example: setting document.getElementById("colorMe").style.background = "lightblue" will set the "DOMElement".style object with a background = "rgb(...)". However, setting document.getElementById("colorMe").style.background = "blue" will set the "DOMElement".style object with a background = "blue". I WANT the second version for all cases of color names, not just simple color names. I would like to bypass how javascript is converting that color into an RGB value for complex color names. Is this possible? EDIT: I Am aware there are ways to convert back and forth, I am just trying to bypass how javascript seems to be converting them "for me"... I'd like it to stay as "lightblue", and the browser seems to handle lightblue as a background color just fine.
@CODE:document.getElementById(xxx).style document.getElementById("colorMe").style.background = "lightblue" "DOMElement".style "rgb(...)" document.getElementById("colorMe").style.background "DOMElement".style background = "blue" div background: string

@CONTENT:Here's some context from a related post of mine: How to databind using to a 2d array of objects of different types So I have a: List<List<FarmyardSpace>>
 I want this to be represented as buttons in cells of a Grid. I can't use UniformGrid as in the related post because I need to define the sizes of the cells in the Grid. Ideally I don't want to have to define Row and Column fields in my data (although perhaps this should be handled by the ViewModel somehow? Just started learning this stuff the other day and I'm still wrapping my head around WPF and MVVM). Here's my latest attempt which does not work (and in fact throws an exception), and in this particular example I'm relying on Column and Row properties existing on the FarmyardSpaces: <ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding FarmyardGrid}">
    <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding}">
                <ItemsPanelTemplate>

                            <RowDefinition />
                            <RowDefinition Height="15"/>

                    <Style TargetType="ContentPresenter">

                    <ColumnDefinition />
                    <ColumnDefinition Width="15"/>
                    <ColumnDefinition />
                    <ColumnDefinition Width="15"/>

        </Style>
    </ItemsControl.ItemContainerStyle>
</ItemsControl>
 I think part of the reason this doesn't work is that the Items contained by the outer ItemsControl are not FarmyardSpaces but List, so they don't have a Column property to bind to. I've also tried it with both the RowDefinitions and ColumnDefinitions in the inner ItemsControl. This gets rid of the exception but also doesn't work and seems wrong to me, especially given the solution that works when using UniformGrid in the related post where the Columns are declared in the outer ItemsControl. Anyways I'd appreciate any help figuring this out, thanks in advance!

        public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
            if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {

                mp.start();
                timeLeft.setText("Status: Initiated");
                startButton.setText("Stop Dreaming");

                startButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onClick(View arg0) {
                        mp.stop();

                    }

                });
 This is what I currently have... How would I set this up correctly?
@CODE:startButton mp startButton.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() {
        @Override
        public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
            if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {

                mp.start();
                timeLeft.setText("Status: Initiated");
                startButton.setText("Stop Dreaming");

                startButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onClick(View arg0) {
                        mp.stop();

                    }

                });

@TITLE:Different ways of zooming in OpenGL
@CONTENT:At the moment I'm achieving a zoom effect in OpenGL by translating the camera position into z direction based on some user input (keyboard functions). Now I've looked at several other examples that use zooming and got a little bit confused whether there are different ways of doing this: for example by changing the FOV with glm::perspective. Is there a difference between changing The fov and my z-translation, and if so, which way is better? What I also don't really understand is when to use glm::scale in the context of zooming, since I'm not using this either.

@TITLE:How to (http?) cache a forwarded request/response?
@CONTENT:I have this controller method that needs to call many other methods (sometimes in other controllers) with $response = $this->forward() to generate a bigger response. How would you go about caching all those responses? For example, should each method handle its own cache? That would be good if the method is also required in other methods, or even as standalone. Either way, how do I do this? I guess http cache won't work in this case.

@TITLE:How can I represent tabular data responsively?
@CONTENT:I have a table which I need to display. On a desktop, it is simple: 4 rows and 10 columns. <table width='100%'>
<thead>
<tr><th colspan='10'>Size Chart (inches)</th></tr>
<tr><th>Size</th><th>6</th><th>8</th><th>10</th><th>12</th><th>14</th><th>16</th><th>18</th><th>20</th><th>22</th></tr>

 However, on a smaller screen, I would need to pivot this 90%, giving 10 rows and 4 columns. I could do this on the server side, but then you would need to know the screensize, so would have to allow on browser sniffing, which is frowned upon in a lot of quarters. I could do this with javascript, but then non-javascript users would suffer. (Is this something that should concern me?) I suppose I could even use the css "content" property to inject the table using media queries, but that just seems so wrong I don't want to even contemplate it. The sizechart is due to appear on an ecommerce site, to give you an idea of the target audience. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Ideally I would like an HTML5/CSS-only solution. Does such a thing exist, without using "content", which just seems so wrong?
@CODE:<table width='100%'>
<thead>
<tr><th colspan='10'>Size Chart (inches)</th></tr>
<tr><th>Size</th><th>6</th><th>8</th><th>10</th><th>12</th><th>14</th><th>16</th><th>18</th><th>20</th><th>22</th></tr>

@CONTENT:jsFiddle of my code: http://jsfiddle.net/8Vcyu/ I have setup a form where the user can input between 1 and 10 lines of information.

@TITLE:Event listeners & js-test-driver?
@CONTENT:My JS gets loaded after the DOM is ready. Once the DOM is ready, the JS checks certain aspects of the environment (window dimensions etc.), binds event listeners to specific elements and then, finally, runs. How do I set this up in js-test-driver? I can use /*:DOC += ... */ to mock my HTML, but I'm not sure how to do that first, then load my script, and have it bind event listeners to elements in it. Honestly, what I'd rather have is jstestdriver load my html page along with all the listed scripts, and use that as the starting point. Maybe there's a better tool? A plugin I can use?

@CONTENT:While testing my answer to Adding HTML5 hidden attribute support to jQuery .toggle() method, I created a JSPerf test to determine how much slower .toggle(function() \[...\]) would be compared to .toggle(). To my amazement, the script with additional processing is reported to execute faster! Besides the results being counter-intuitive, I suspect a problem because I also see the toggling on the screen long after the results have returned. How can I "fix" my test to get accurate results?

@TITLE:How to keep image proportion using calc (width - X)
@CONTENT:I know that specifying only a width or a height in percentages will allow images to maintain their correct proportions, however, it seems if I try something like: img {width: calc(100% - 60px);}
 I lose the proportion. The image will become 60px narrower. I then tried this: img {width: calc(100% - 60px); height: calc(100% - 60px);}
 ..but the image still wouldn't retain its correct proportion. Does anyone know of a way with CSS, or possibly some light js, to use the calc unit while retaining the correct proportion? The end goal is to have all images within a large (encompassing most of the content on each page) div assigned css to reduce their image size to fit within a mobile device (specifically iphone portrait orientation), without overflowing and causing a horizontal scroll, or other elements which have 100% widths (in order to span the page, such as a banner) to fall short of the full page width. I suppose using a media query specific to the device width in order to give all images the the max px width after adding up my total margins % paddings would work, but I'd rather use the calc values, if for nothing else, that I'm annoyed I can't use them.

@TITLE:Get data from servlet to JSP without forward?
@CONTENT:I need a double value from my servlet to markup in my JSP. My doGet() is sending back formatted HTML tables with values from an ArrayList, so after I got that working I decided to tackle this part. Servlet: //Code getting the tables I need     //Send back the result, this all works good
    response.setContentType("text/html");
    response.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
    response.getWriter().write(returnAsHTML.toString());
 What I added to try and get the double value     //Send back the result

    double test = 20;
    request.setAttribute("Test",test);

    response.setContentType("text/html");
    response.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
    response.getWriter().write(returnAsHTML.toString());

    getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("index.jsp").forward(request,response);
 In JSP:   <!-- This variable is unresolved -->
  <small>Test : ${Test}</small>
 The forwarding seems to crash the whole party. I am new to JSP, I'm sure I am missing something small. I need to keep the response.getWriter() stuff there, it gets a lot of the information I need. Now I just don't know how to get my double values I need as well, because they will be displayed on a whole different part of the page.

@TITLE:Jersey + Guice + Tomcat producing 404 when served with something other than root directory
@CONTENT:I have a resource that looks like this: @Path("/Resources/Console")
public class ConsoleResource {

    @POST
    @Consumes({ MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML })
    @Produces({ MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML })
    public String post(/* */) {
        /* */
    }

}
 Whenever my JerseyServletModule is configured as follows, the services work: @Override
protected void configureServlets() {
    bind(ConsoleResource.class);

    bind(MessageBodyReader.class).to(JacksonJsonProvider.class);
    bind(MessageBodyWriter.class).to(JacksonJsonProvider.class);

    serve("/*").with(GuiceContainer.class);
}
 But things like index.html don't. Changing "/*" to "/Resources/*" causes things like index.html to work, again, but then ConsoleResource's @POST method doesn't work (I get a 404 whenever I access /Resources/Console). I assume I want to get the latter working (like this). Thoughts? Thanks!
@CODE:@Path("/Resources/Console")
public class ConsoleResource {

    @POST
    @Consumes({ MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML })
    @Produces({ MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML })
    public String post(/* */) {
        /* */
    }

} @Override
protected void configureServlets() {
    bind(ConsoleResource.class);

    bind(MessageBodyReader.class).to(JacksonJsonProvider.class);
    bind(MessageBodyWriter.class).to(JacksonJsonProvider.class);

    serve("/*").with(GuiceContainer.class);
} "/*" "/Resources/*" ConsoleResource @POST /Resources/Console

@TITLE:How do I correlate my original data with clustered data
@CONTENT:I have a distance matrix presents the distance matrix for pairwise elements such as     A B C D .....
A   n1 n2 n3
B n1    
C n2 n4
D n3 n5 ....... 
E.........
 i input the array like for clustering  arry=  [ 0 n1, n2, n3..
   n1.......
   n2 n4
   n3 n5 ]


Y=sch.linkage(arry,'single')
cutoff=1e-6
T=sch.fcluster(Y, cutoff,'distance')
print T

Z=sch.dendrogram(Y, color_threshold=cutoff)
 my fcluster output is like [ 4 10 12 1 5 13 2 11 1 7 8 3 14 6 10 16 9 15 1 7] from a previous poster of others Clustering with scipy - clusters via distance matrix, how to get back the original objects I understand the output T[i] only presents the number of element in a cluster ..how I link the original element A, B ,C ,D ,E..... elements with the cluster result and the dendrogram? and lab them properly into my figures.
@CODE:A B C D .....
A   n1 n2 n3
B n1

@TITLE:Convert query string dictionary (or associative array) to dictionary [duplicate]
@CONTENT:I'm trying to accept a query string of the form ?param[key1]=value1&param[key2]=value2
 and convert it into a Dictionary in C# MVC 4. This is trivial to do in PHP, but I haven't been able to find any method of reproducing this in C#. I know I can take an array via ?param=value1&param=value2
 but that leaves issues of ordering and isn't nearly as useful for my purposes. In the hopes that this isn't a limitation of the framework, how might I implement a dictionary-style conversion in C#? To clarify: I'm not looking to convert a query string into an NVC, but rather to convert query string parameters into their own NVCs. This is NOT as simple as ParseQueryString() or the Request.QueryString object.

@TITLE:selecting files and saving it to the defined location using folder browse dialog
@CONTENT:I had made this code for user to select a folder so that my two files will be copied to that. The code is this: string sourcePath = @"C:\Documents and Settings\akib\";
string fileName1 = @"untitled.jpg";
string fileName2 = @"Copyuntitled.jpg";
DialogResult result = folderBrowserDialog1.ShowDialog();
if (result == DialogResult.OK)
{
    var destinationFolderName = folderBrowserDialog1.SelectedPath;
    if (Directory.Exists(destinationFolderName))

        File.Copy(sourcePath + "/" + fileName2, destinationFolderName 
                  + "/" + fileName2);
    }
}
 But now I want to to reverse of it. That is if user have two files in some location I want to copy that to the c:\programfiles\myfolder. So FolderBrowseDialog can be used in such case? If yes how?

@LINK:/questions/14631967/javascript-method-processing-fixed-by-alert
@TITLE:JavaScript method processing fixed by alert()
@CONTENT:I have SWT application which uses map service API (http://mapy.cz particularly) for acquiring image as background for some additional drawings based on that provided map data. Before the browser component screenshot is made by SWT GC instance, I'm trying to hide the controls from map layer, to have it cleanest as possible. This functionality is provided by service's JS API this way: function hideControls() {
    var controls = map.getControls();
    for (var i = controls.length; i > 0; i--) {
        map.removeControl(controls[i]);
    }
    //alert('test');
}
 This works absolutely flawless in all desktop browsers by calling hideControls() function from console. But if the method is called by SWT Browser component by browser.evaluate("hideControls();"); 
 it just do not work until the alert() function (as commented right now) is uncommented. Then alert dialog is shown and controls hidden as they should be. Any idea why alert() method call cause correct working of that JavaScript function? EDIT Some additional code context browser.evaluate("hideControls();");
// ugly ie scroll bar force workaround
// calls JS methods which returns size of map content in browser component
Double mapWidth = (Double) browser.evaluate("return getSizeX();");
Double mapHeight = (Double) browser.evaluate("return getSizeY();");
// creates new canvas
GC gc = new GC(browser);
// do the screenshot
capturedImage = new Image(display, mapWidth.intValue(), mapHeight.intValue());
gc.copyArea(capturedImage, 0, 0);
// cleanout
gc.dispose();
 JavaScript methods for map size calculation (provided by JS API for map service) function getSizeX() {
    return map.getSize().x;
}
function getSizeY() {
    return map.getSize().y;
}
 EDIT2 After some deeper debug the method which removes controls from map layer is SMap.prototype.removeControl = function (a) {
    var b = this.controls.indexOf(a); 
    - 1 != b && ((a = a.getContainer()) && this.controlLayer.removeItem(a), this.controls.splice(b, 1))
};
 So for instance (for HUD control) SMap.Layer.HUD.prototype.removeItem = function (a) {
    a.parentNode.removeChild(a)
};
 That means it directly change the DOM tree, though it's not asynchronous..
@CODE:function hideControls() {
    var controls = map.getControls();
    for (var i = controls.length; i > 0; i--) {
        map.removeControl(controls[i]);
    }
    //alert('test');
} hideControls() browser.evaluate("hideControls();"); alert() browser.evaluate("hideControls();");
// ugly ie scroll bar force workaround
// calls JS methods which returns size of map content in browser component
Double mapWidth = (Double) browser.evaluate("return getSizeX();");
Double mapHeight = (Double) browser.evaluate("return getSizeY();");
// creates new canvas
GC gc = new GC(browser);
// do the screenshot
capturedImage = new Image(display, mapWidth.intValue(), mapHeight.intValue());
gc.copyArea(capturedImage, 0, 0);
// cleanout
gc.dispose(); function getSizeX() {
    return map.getSize().x;
}
function getSizeY() {
    return map.getSize().y;
} SMap.prototype.removeControl = function (a) {
    var b = this.controls.indexOf(a); 
    - 1 != b && ((a = a.getContainer()) && this.controlLayer.removeItem(a), this.controls.splice(b, 1))
}; SMap.Layer.HUD.prototype.removeItem = function (a) {
    a.parentNode.removeChild(a)
}; hideControls setTimeout hideControls() () () hideControls() browser.evaluate("hideControls();");

@TITLE:Pass And Return A String Into VB.NET Web Method
@CONTENT:I am trying to send and return a simple string to a VB.NET web method from Javascript using AJAX. Here is the Javascript/jQuery script I am using: function jQuerySerial() {
//I SET A VARIABLE TO THE STRING I WANT TO PASS INTO MY WEB METHOD
var str = "Hello World";

//AND TRY TO PASS IT INTO MY VB.NET WEB METHOD
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",

    error: function (e) {
        alert("There was an error retrieving records: " + e);
    }
});
}//END jQuerySerial
 And here is the very simple VB.net Web Method. The Web Method does nothing but get the string and then pass it back to Javascript:    <WebMethod( )> _
Public Function testWebService(str As String) As String
    Return str
End Function
 When I attempt to run this the error: function fires and returns a message saying: "There was an error retrieving records: [object Object]"
 I have many, many other Web Methods in this same Web Service class that manipulate database records and they all work. But, this is the first one I have ever tried to write using the $.ajax syntax and return something to the calling Javascript so I am completely clueless on whats wrong here. Any suggestions on how to make this work would be appreciated. Thanks

@CONTENT:I've read the last C++11 draft (n3337 - is it the last one?), and I got a question for a possible implementation I've been working on. Let's say we have this code: extern "Objective C" {

      static Object *alloc();
      Object *init();
  };
};
 Then calling Object *x = Object::alloc()->init();
 The question is that I didn't understand if it is allowed for the compiler to control the calling convention of extern "X" blocks: the idea would be to "translate" the calls to objc_msgSend(blablabla) - would that be conformant to the standard, or would it be considered an extension (since it wouldn't just modify the symbol name, but as well as a complex "calling convention" here)? Of course I could implement this by making a weak function that is called as __thiscall and then calls and returns the method itself - but the question continues, would it be conformant? Thanks!

 what I would like is this same script to be run on every directory of the current directory (non recursive). for example if i am in directory c:\test, and that directory as the folder alex, liza, and harry, then i want this script to be applied to c:\test\alex, c:\test\liza, c:\test\harry The output that I would want would be: 4352    .JPG    directory name
2352    .doc    directory name

 How can I modify the above script to do this for every directory and append the directory name?

@TITLE:Ignore commas between quotations when reading CSV Oracle stored procedure UTL_FILE
@CONTENT:Example data: 1, test, "xy, yz", dog, cat
2, test2, xy, fish, bear
 As you can see above, the second column may or may not be enclosed in quotes with a comma as part of the string. I am simply trying to find a way to ignore the comma within the quotes, if either is there. I am using UTL_FILE and can't use external tables, I know I know, but I am not the one who gets to make decisions. I haven't really "tried" anything yet, because I haven't been able to find anything to try in this particular scenario. I have code that extracts substrings between each comma, but obviously, will split "xy, yz" into 2 separate strings. I have been able to get it to work on ONE row, by using " as the delimiter for that specific column, but that goes to hell, when the next row has no quotes for the second column.

@TITLE:QSQLTableModel inheritor and QTableView
@CONTENT:I wrote QSQLTableModel inheritor for working with qml and it's work well. I need use it with QTableView too, data shows, but I cannot modify it - when I edit everything is ok, but all changes drop when I get out from field (I know about editStrategy, but the problem occurs earlier). I suppose that something wrong with virtual function, but I cant undestant what. If i create QSqlTableModel with the same parameters, everything is ok. Somebody have any idea how can i fix this? My code: h: class ListModel : public QSqlTableModel
{

    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY( int count READ rowCount() NOTIFY countChanged())

signals:
    void countChanged();

public:
    Q_INVOKABLE QVariant data(const QModelIndex &index, int role) const;
    ListModel(QObject *parent, QSqlDatabase _db):QSqlTableModel(parent,_db){this->setEditStrategy(QSqlTableModel::OnManualSubmit);}
    void applyRoles();
#ifdef HAVE_QT5

virtual QHash<int, QByteArray> roleNames() const{return roles;}

#endif

private:
    int count;
    QHash<int, QByteArray> roles;
};
 cpp: //based on http://qt-project.org/wiki/How_to_use_a_QSqlQueryModel_in_QML

void ListModel::applyRoles()
{
    roles.clear();
    qDebug()<<"\n"<<this->tableName();
    for (int i = 0; i < this->columnCount(); i++) {
            QString role=this->headerData(i, Qt::Horizontal).toString();
            roles[Qt::UserRole + i + 1] = QVariant(role).toByteArray();
            qDebug()<<this->headerData(i, Qt::Horizontal);
    }
#ifndef HAVE_QT5
    setRoleNames(roles);
#endif
}

QVariant ListModel::data(const QModelIndex &index, int role) const{

    QVariant value;
    if(role < Qt::UserRole)
    {
        value = QSqlQueryModel::data(index, role);
    }
    else {
        int columnIdx = role - Qt::UserRole - 1;
        QModelIndex modelIndex = this->index(index.row(), columnIdx);
        value = QSqlQueryModel::data(modelIndex, Qt::DisplayRole);
    }
    return value;
}
 UPD I understood that the problem is in data method's quantifier const, if I remove it everything is ok with QTableView, but I cant get data from model with gml's listviews. I see only one solution - replace interition from QSqlTableModel with aggregation it, but maybe someone knows better solution?

@TITLE:Set the binding of a dropdown in knockout to an object
@CONTENT:I am trying to trying to set a the binding a drop down list (kendo drop down) uses to a full object. I am using Knockout-Kendo to accomplish the binding but I don't think the kendo stuff or knockout-kendo stuff is a factor in my problem. For example I have the following object var model = {
  "Client": null,
  "Clients": [
    {
      "CompanyAccount": {
        "RelationshipManager": {},
        "CompanyAccountId": 1,
        "Name": "My Company Name",
        "PhoneNumber": "(555) 555-5555",
        "Address": {
          "State": {
            "StateId": 6,
            "Name": "New York",
            "Abbreviation": "NY"
          },
          "AddressId": 1,
          "Street1": "123 Any Street",
          "Street2": null,
          "City": "New York",
          "StateId": 6,
          "Zip": 12345
        }
      },
      "ClientId": 1,
      "Name": "New Client 1/30/2013",
      "CompanyAccountId": 1,
      "ContactName": null,
      "Salutation": null,
      "ClientAddress": null,
      "OfficePhoneNumber": null,
      "OfficePhoneExtension": null,
      "MobilePhoneNumber": null,
      "Email": null,
      "TrackingState": 0
    }
  ]
  }
}
 I use the knockout-mapping plugin to turn all the stuff into an observable. var viewModel = ko.mapping.fromJS(model); ko.applyBindings(viewModel); My html binding looks like this <select data-bind="kendoDropDownList: { dataTextField: 'Name', optionLabel: 'Select An Client...', dataValueField: 'ClientId', data: Clients, value: Client }"></select>
 But I'd like to set the Client property with data like Client: {
  "CompanyAccount": {
    "RelationshipManager": {},
    "CompanyAccountId": 1,
    "Name": "My Company Name",
    "PhoneNumber": "(555) 555-5555",
    "Address": {
      "State": {
        "StateId": 6,
        "Name": "New York",
        "Abbreviation": "NY"
      },
      "AddressId": 1,
      "Street1": "123 Any Street",
      "Street2": null,
      "City": "New York",
      "StateId": 6,
      "Zip": 12345
    }
  },
  "ClientId": 1,
  "Name": "New Client 1/30/2013",
  "CompanyAccountId": 1,
  "ContactName": null,
  "Salutation": null,
  "ClientAddress": null,
  "OfficePhoneNumber": null,
  "OfficePhoneExtension": null,
  "MobilePhoneNumber": null,
  "Email": null,
  "TrackingState": 0
}
 I can only figure out how to set the property with data like '1' or 'New Client 1/30/2013' * Edit I am trying to design this because my lack of experience with Entity Framework. If I have a foreign key and an object that is tied to the foreign key in my model that is sent to the client. Updating the foreign key but not the model causes inconsistent state exception on the model when calling SaveChanges(). I think my best approach now is to create a ViewModel without those objects (only containing the ForeignKey Ids).
@CODE:var model = {
  "Client": null,
  "Clients": [
    {
      "CompanyAccount": {
        "RelationshipManager": {},

@CONTENT:I am trying to select a specific option from a dropdown list when the page is rendered. On my Controller I have this code: ViewBag.PropertyId = new SelectList(db.Properties, "PropertyId", "PropertyName", id.ToString()); On my view, This does not work. The selected option is the first option always. @Html.DropDownList("PropertyId", (SelectList)ViewBag.PropertyId) This does work on my view, the correct option is selected. However, I can not save this because I need the name of the select list to be PropertyId, so that it is posted correctly. @Html.DropDownList("sadgfsadsaf", (SelectList)ViewBag.PropertyId) Can someone please help me understand what i should be doing here? I understand i should use a viewmodel instead of Viewbag but I just want get this working first. Thank you

Is it really impossible to distinguish between an event from the user and an event from my own assignment statement? Yikes!

@LINK:/questions/14611768/issue-with-kendo-combobox
@TITLE:Issue with kendo combobox
@CONTENT:I have defined kendocombox in my html like below <input  id="selFrameworkVersion" style="width: 210px" data-bind="kendoComboBox: { dataTextField: 'Name', dataValueField: 'Id', data:  $root.versionListByProductType, value:  $root.editFrameworkVersion, optionsCaption: 'Select Version...'  }" />
 The combobox loads correctly and sets value but when it doesnt set focus to proper item in list. See image below You can see value is 5.5.1 but it sets to 5.4 which is first item in list. I now know that why its happening. On my combobox you can see that i have value set as $root.editFrameworkVersion. In my view model i use subscribe event on that value. See code below self.editFrameworkVersion.subscribe(function (value) {
        var combobox = $("#selFrameworkVersion").data("kendoComboBox");

        var callback = function (data) {

            self.editOnlyAlternativeVersions(self.versionListByProductType());

            combobox.select(function (dataItem) {
               return dataItem.Name === value;
            });
            self.editOnlyAlternativeVersions.remove(function (data) {

                return parseInt($("#selFrameworkVersion").attr('value')) === parseInt(data.Id()); 
            });


        };

        loadVersionListByProductType(self.editProductType().Id(), callback);
 }); I use this subscribe event to do some logic. In this event i am calling WCF service which loads value again in that combobox and thats why its always set to first value. But its required for me to call that service for some logic. Then i added code in that subscribe event which you already have seen above combobox.select(function (dataItem) {
               return dataItem.Name === value;
            });
 This code sets the value correctly but only if combobox loses focus. What should i do?
@CODE:<input  id="selFrameworkVersion" style="width: 210px" data-bind="kendoComboBox: { dataTextField: 'Name', dataValueField: 'Id', data:  $root.versionListByProductType, value:  $root.editFrameworkVersion, optionsCaption: 'Select Version...'  }" /> self.editFrameworkVersion.subscribe(function (value) {
        var combobox = $("#selFrameworkVersion").data("kendoComboBox");

        var callback = function (data) {

            self.editOnlyAlternativeVersions(self.versionListByProductType());

            combobox.select(function (dataItem) {
               return dataItem.Name === value;
            });
            self.editOnlyAlternativeVersions.remove(function (data) {

                return parseInt($("#selFrameworkVersion").attr('value')) === parseInt(data.Id()); 
            });


        };

@TITLE:How to use MVVM when the Model is created by View constructor
@CONTENT:I'm now trying to use the MVVM approach to display some hierarchical data but until now, I didn't implement any specific design pattern. As simply as I can explain, I have 2 class libraries. Log.cs Backup.cs And I have my WPF project. Simply put, the Backup class performs some copy and paste functions. Each copy and paste is logged (using the Log class). Currently, the logs (List) are stored in memory (and this is where maybe there is an issue). When the operation is complete (all backups are finished), I want the Logs to be displayed. My backup.cs class creates an instance of the MainWindow and passes the List<Log> object as a constructor, and I bind it to the data context. This works fine. However, I now want to use the MVVM approach since I want to use 2 way binding (I want to filter by log status (success or fail (or other states)). So, does any one feel this is possible with my current design or is the only way forward to be saving the logs as an XML file (or text or similar) just so my Model can be created (using LinqToXml)? Or is there a different approach?

@TITLE:Convert Html to a Printable Image
@CONTENT:I am working on a project which runs on .NET 2.0. My task is to recreate the data displayed in HTML as a prinatable image (with the resolution of at least 150dpi). I looked into several options, to no avail: The WebBrowser class object. While rendering html as an image, it uses the screen resolution on the server machine. The Sciter by Terra Informatica. It does not exposes a property with which one can set the resolution of the output image Awesomium can be used with .NET 4.0 or higher only. I wonder if there is a .NET library out there that can convert an Html page to a printable image. Any help is much appreciated.

echo '<p><strong>Question:</strong> ' .htmlspecialchars($arrQuestionNo[$key]). ': ' .htmlspecialchars($arrQuestionContent[$key]). '</p>' . PHP_EOL;


}
 Now the details output with no problems if I select a particular student or a particular question from the respective drop down menus as the db is able to retrieve the values from those drop down menus as they are actual ids in the db. But the issue is if I select an All option from either drop down menus. The value of the All option in both drop down menus is 0. Now 0 is not in the db as an id, what I wanted to do is that if the user selects the All option, then it displays All the student details if selected in student drop down menu, All the question details if selected in the question drop down menu. Now the query is working in gathering the data to do this as it uses the dynamic WHERE clause built to include the appropriate conditions. But my question is how can I get it to display all the details of students/questions if the user has selected the All options in the relevant drop down menus?

 SCREENSHOT: As you can see above, it shows I selected on student but I have chosen All Qustions. Yet it only displays one question under the Student Answer heading, in this example, the total number of questions which you can see in the brackets is 2, so it should show 2 questions, not one question DB SCREENSHOT: Slightly shortened version of normal query but this would not affect main query as that too shows same number of rows. It shows 2 rows as there are two questions. The results below is for a single student StudentId = 1, All questions in Assessment 26 (SessionId = 26).

@TITLE:Reading a blob from MySQL with Java
@CONTENT:I have a problem reading a blob from a MySQL database with Java. I need to write a webservice with jax-rs to deliver an image saved in the database. For transport, it has to be encoded using Base64. This is my code: public String getImage(@PathParam("id") int id) throws SQLException{
    System.out.println(id);
    String img64str = "null";
    Blob image = null;
    Connection conn = MySQLConnection.getInstance();
    if(conn != null)
    {
        try{
        // Anfrage-Statement erzeugen.
        Statement query;
        query = conn.createStatement();

        // Ergebnistabelle erzeugen und abholen.

            String sql = "SELECT bild FROM beitraege where id="+id;
            ResultSet result = query.executeQuery(sql);
            //Ergebniss zur?ckliefern
            while (result.next()) {
                System.out.println("while");
                image = result.getBlob("bild");
                InputStream binaryStream = image.getBinaryStream(1, image.length());
                String str= binaryStream.toString();
                byte[] bdata=str.getBytes();
                byte[] img64 = Base64.encode(bdata);
                img64str = new String(img64);
            }

        }catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
   }

    return img64str;

 Filtering is working, except for a couple columns I want to modify. The Created/RunDate column I would like to filter a range somehow. Picking a single date is not useful. The Interface, Type and Status columns I would like to use drop downs. What's the best way to do this? I find the jqGrid documentation VERY difficult to follow, there are just so many options. It took me an hour to figure out that I needed stringResult: true to get my filter options into the GridSettings.Where property in the controller. And if it matters, it's a .Net 4.0, MVC app. EDIT: Bonus Question: How do I make it case insensitive.

@LINK:/questions/14609174/openlayers-class-with-openlayers-control-getfeature
@TITLE:OpenLayers.Class with OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature
@CONTENT:I'm wondering if someone could point me in the right direction to force the BBOX of OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature to be always in long/lat coordinates. I'm trying to get this with OpenLayers.Class, so the new control will inherit OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature with just the small modification in BBOX. This is what I've done: OpenLayers.Control.myGetFeature = OpenLayers.Class(OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature,{
        selectBox: function(position){
            var opts = OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature(position);
            var baseSRSutm = this.map.getprojectionObject();
            var layerSRSdd = new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:4326');
            opts.params.bbox = this.map.getExtent().transform(baseSRSutm,layerSRSdd).toBBOX(null,firstLayer.reverseAxisOrder());
        }
        return opts;
    });
 but I'm getting that some "}" are missing. Is this the right way to use OpenLayers.Class to do what I want? Any help is much appreciated. PS. I'm using OpenLayers 2.11 EDIT: Moving "return opts;" inside the function solved the above problem but it complained about CLASS_NAME is missing. Adding that, it still complained about the same, but after a couple of clicks or boxes it sent the request, however the sent bbox is still in UTM, where could the problem be? here it is the code: var mycontrol = function(){
        var protocol = new OpenLayers.Protocol.HTTP({
            url: 'http://www.....',
            format: new OpenLayers.Format.GeoJSON({
                ignoreExtraDims: true,
                'internalProjection': new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:900913'),
                'externalProjection': new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:4326')
            })
        });

        OpenLayers.Control.myGetFeature = OpenLayers.Class(OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature,{
            selectBox: function(position){
                var opts = OpenLayers.Control.GetFeature(position);
                var baseSRSutm = this.map.getprojectionObject();
    console.log('this is the baseSRSutm' + baseSRSutm); // doesnt appear in firebug
                var layerSRSdd = new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:4326');
                opts.params.bbox = this.map.getExtent().transform(baseSRSutm,layerSRSdd).toBBOX(null,firstLayer.reverseAxisOrder());
    console.log('this is the opts.params.bbox' + opts.params.bbox); // doesnt appear in firebug
                return opts;
            },
            CLASS_NAME: "OpenLayers.Control.myGetFeature"
        });

      return new OpenLayers.Control.myGetFeature({
            protocol: protocol,
            box: true,
            click: true,
            single: false,
            clickTolerance: 10,
            eventListeners:{
                // some stuff
            }
        });
    };
 because the console.log doesn't appear in firebug, I think the problem is in the OpenLayers.Control.myGetFeature and OpenLayers.Class. It seems to me that the "selectBox" function is the one I need, but the subclass itself is not read by the return. Please help on this one, thanks in advance,

@LINK:/questions/14608614/why-is-powershells-move-item-deleting-the-destination-directory
@TITLE:Why is Powershell's Move-Item deleting the destination directory?
@CONTENT:I need to replace square brackets in filenames, and I've successfully created (and validated at the console) a -replace. Now I'm trying to Move-Item to a new directory because this bug in Powershell 2.0 prevents me from doing a simple file rename. Here's my script: $txtPath = "c:\users\xxxxxx\desktop\cgc\tx"     #source files
$txtPath2 = "c:\users\xxxxxx\desktop\cgc\tx2"   #renamed files
Get-ChildItem $txtPath | foreach { 
    Move-Item -literalpath C:\users\xxxxxx\desktop\test001 ($_.Name -replace '\{|}','_') 
}
 Here's what's happening: I was using the $txtPath2 variable, but kept getting "cannot bind to null directory" errors, so I explicitly coded to the path to see if there was something odd with how the variable parsed. Now, I get this error: Move-Item : Cannot move item because the item at 'C:\users\xxxxxx\desktop\test001' does not exist.
At C:\users\xxxxxx\desktop\cgc\rni.ps1:5 char:10
+ Move-Item <<<<  -literalpath C:\users\xxxxxx\desktop\test001 ($_.Name -replace '\{|}','_')
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [Move-Item], PSInvalidOperationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidOperation,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.MoveItemCommand
 Here's what's odd: I create the new directory. I run the script, watch it vanish from my desktop as the script fails. WTF? I've quit and restarted the console application to flush any variables. I've tried different flavors of variable vs. constant in the Move-Item line. Unless there's a Move-Item parameter that I'm missing, I really have no idea what's going on. Does anyone else see anything that would cause my file to be deleted? EDIT: After editing to Get-ChildItem $txtPath | % { [system.io.file]::Move($_.fullname, ($i.FullName -replace '\[|\]', '') ) }
 I get a new error: Exception calling "Move" with "2" argument(s): "Empty file name is not legal.

@TITLE:Mono autoloading or auto namespace / class referencing
@CONTENT:I am new to Mono, just freshly installed and am trying to get the basic setup up. Hello.cs: using System;
using Customz;

public class Hello
{
    public static int Main(string[] args)
    {

}
 Basicly, I have been working with C# previously in Unity3D's adaption of MonoDevelop and Visual Studio. I remember, that upon compilation, all the classes / namespaces get auto referenced when they are requested. Plus, they are looked up no matter how deep they dwell within the project directory / subdirectories. Compiling this with: mcs "C:\Users\psycketom\Desktop\Mono-C#\test\Hello.cs"
 Results in: C:\Users\psycketom\Desktop\Mono-C#\test\Hello.cs(2,7): error CS0246: The type or namespace name `Customz' could not be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference? Compilation failed: 1 error(s), 0 warnings Well, I know that I am not missing a using directive, but I have a feeling that I am missing an assembly reference. How can I fix this and achieve the Visual Studio like behavior? Update: I managed to compile everything in a directory by issuing: mcs -out:app.exe "C:\Users\psycketom\Desktop\Mono-C#\test\*.cs"
 While it works, it does include only files within the folder, not taking into account any subfolders residing in the folder. How do I make it select all the files, including those residing in subfolders? (I'm starting to think that I may need a bash script or something)
@CODE:using System;

@TITLE:Updating lucene index - the most popular way
@CONTENT:I am updating lucene index onec a day. My strategy in general is: Find all objects in DB that was modified since last index generation. Create new tmp-index for these objects. (old index is stil available) Remove all new indexed Documents (they are in tmp-index) from the old index using IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Term) Merge old index and tmp-index using IndexWriter.addIndexes(...) I have found that in lucene wiki: There is no direct update procedure in Lucene... I have found also that in lucene 4.1.0 doc: A document can be updated with updateDocument... I have tried IndexWriter.updateDocument(Term, Document) but then performing search with filter I got NPE from one of my methods what not happens when I update index as describe in 1-4. Have anyone had a similar problem? How do you update your index?

@TITLE:How to handle ViewExpiredException by showing JavaScript alert?
@CONTENT:I've read the question Handle ViewExireException/ajax and display a Primefaces dialog and the answer from BalusC. I'd want to handle the ViewExpiredException by showing the alert with information to refresh the page. I've taken the suggestion from BalusC to user RequestContextto put JavaScript to execute, and I've removed the JSF redirection because I'm not using it: @Override
public void handle() throws FacesException {
    for (Iterator<ExceptionQueuedEvent> i = getUnhandledExceptionQueuedEvents().iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
        ExceptionQueuedEvent event = i.next();
        ExceptionQueuedEventContext context = (ExceptionQueuedEventContext) event.getSource();
        Throwable t = context.getException();
        if (t instanceof ViewExpiredException) {
            ViewExpiredException vee = (ViewExpiredException) t;
            try {
                log.info("Catched ViewExpiredException for view {}", vee.getViewId());
                RequestContext.getCurrentInstance().execute("handleViewExpired("+vee.getViewId()+")");
                return;
            } finally {
                i.remove();
            }
        } 
    }
    // At this point, the queue will not contain any ViewExpiredEvents.
    // Therefore, let the parent handle them.
    getWrapped().handle();

}
 The problem is, I got NullPointerException when executing the handle method from wrapped handler. I've added the return clause, and after adding it, the effect was the same: [30.01.13 15:45:59:140 CET] 0000002e ErrorPageWrit E An exception occurred javax.faces.FacesException: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.myfaces.shared_impl.context.ExceptionHandlerImpl.wrap(ExceptionHandlerImpl.java:241) at org.apache.myfaces.shared_impl.context.ExceptionHandlerImpl.handle(ExceptionHandlerImpl.java:156) at my.project.web.handler.ViewExpiredExceptionExceptionHandler.handle(ViewExpiredExceptionExceptionHandler.java:59) at org.apache.myfaces.lifecycle.LifecycleImpl.executePhase(LifecycleImpl.java:191) at org.apache.myfaces.lifecycle.LifecycleImpl.execute(LifecycleImpl.java:118) So, the parent handle method is executed, thought there should be the return from method (The info string is logged). I'm using PrimeFaces 3.4 and MyFaces 2.0.7, everything on WebSphere 7. I don't understand what is happening here. Is it possible to achieve what I want, and if so, what I'm doing wrong?
@CODE:ViewExpiredException RequestContext @Override

        Throwable t = context.getException();
        if (t instanceof ViewExpiredException) {

@TITLE:EmberJs: how to use connectOutlet
@CONTENT:I've created a simple test in which I try to use connectOutlet. However, not much is rendered. Here is my test code: http://jsfiddle.net/jeanluca/53dpA/ Just to summarize the application. I think the problems is inside the following code App.Router.map(function(match) {
    match('/').to('index');
});     

App.IndexRoute = Em.Route.extend({
    connectOutlets: function(router) {
        router.get('applicationController').connectOutlet('sidebar', 'navigation');
        router.get('applicationController').connectOutlet('content');
    }       
});
 Any suggestions what is wrong with this code ? Also, in almost any example code I find on the web, I see that the App.Router is defined App.Router = Em.Router.extend({
        enableLogging: true,

        root: Em.Route.extend({

            index: Em.Route.extend({
                route: '/',
                connectOutlets: function(router) {   
    .... etc ....
 Because with ember-latest App.Router is already defined, I assume this is the old way of defining the Router ?
@CODE:App.Router.map(function(match) {
    match('/').to('index');
});     

App.IndexRoute = Em.Route.extend({
    connectOutlets: function(router) {
        router.get('applicationController').connectOutlet('sidebar', 'navigation');
        router.get('applicationController').connectOutlet('content');
    }       
}); App.Router = Em.Router.extend({

 There are plenty of them. Also I have add thos files in the proper folders and add to a bundle so it is loading as soon as the application starts. (I could verify that either.) Yet I am unable to find the reason those events are not triggering. What is exactly the purpose of those registrations?

I'm using OpenGL 2.0 with a vertex shader that just sets the color to be red in a way that the quad should be visible on the screen. Before callig glutMainLoop I generate the vertex buffer object: #include <GL/glut.h>
#include <GL/glew.h>

vector<GLfloat> quad; 
GLuint buffer;

void init()
{
    // This routine gets called before glutMainLoop(), I omitted all the code
    // that has to do with shaders, since it's correct.
    glewInit();
    quad= vector<GLfloat>{-1,-1,0, 1,-1,0, 1,1,0, -1,1,0};
    glGenBuffers(1,&buffer);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,sizeof(GLfloat)*12,quad.data(),GL_STATIC_DRAW);

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,buffer);

 The problem is that nothing is drawn to the screen, I just see a black window. The quad should be red because I set the red color in the vertex shader.
@CODE:#include <GL/glut.h>
#include <GL/glew.h>

vector<GLfloat> quad; 
GLuint buffer;

void init()
{
    // This routine gets called before glutMainLoop(), I omitted all the code
    // that has to do with shaders, since it's correct.
    glewInit();
    quad= vector<GLfloat>{-1,-1,0, 1,-1,0, 1,1,0, -1,1,0};
    glGenBuffers(1,&buffer);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,sizeof(GLfloat)*12,quad.data(),GL_STATIC_DRAW);
} void display()
{
    glClearColor(0,0,0,0);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,buffer);
    glVertexAttribPointer(0,3,GL_FLOAT,GL_FALSE,0,0);
    // I also tried passing quad.data() as last argument, but nothing to do.
    glDrawArrays(GL_QUADS,0,12);
    glDisableVertexAttribArray(0);

@CONTENT:I have a java ee project with an existing database. Now I expand my project local by using the liquibase-maven-plugin. The project create automatically a tag and makes an update. Are there any steps or preparations I have to take care of before deploying this project at the production? Local f.e. I played with the generateChangeLog command, which creates a xml-schema file of the existing database. Do I need this file for any purpose? Actually I just can set first of all a tag and then go on and work with liquibase and the database. Do I miss here something or is it really that easy?

@CONTENT:Just for fun, I want to write an aspect such as say logging, tracing or instrumentation/profiling. But I don't want to use any of the available AOP frameworks already available. I've used PostSharp in the past and now that ASP.NET MVC introduces action filters, which are very similar to aspect/advise injection, and .NET 4 has CodeContracts, which are also very similar to aspects, I have a pretty good idea of what I want my aspect API to look like. The only thing I haven't figured out yet, and I believe that it is central to building an AOP library, is how to know when a method is being invoked? What, do I keep watching the callstack? Do I look up the main UI thread and its synchronization context to see if it has been assigned some work, i.e. been given a method to enter into? What is the way to know if a method is going to be called?

@CONTENT:A site I'm working on was built using jQuery v1.8.3. I'm attempting to upgrade to v1.9.0. Using the jQuery Migration plug-in (v.1.0.0), I'm getting messages in the console saying .attr() is deprecated. In the .js file these two lines are being used: var branchID = $('select#ddlBranches').attr('value');
$('select#ddlBranches').attr('value', branchID).change();
 They're intended to get the value (which is a record ID) of the current selection in the dropdown, and fire the change event on the dropdown, setting it to the indicated value. The first line results in this message in the console: "property-based jQuery.fn.attr('value') is deprecated" The second line causes this to show in the console: "property-based jQuery.fn.attr('value', val) is deprecated" The Upgrade guide discusses .attr(), but I don't see anywhere that mentions what to replace it with. What am I supposed to replace .attr() with to accomplish the same functionality? Thanks for anyone's help.

@Delegate
private Configuration conf;
 ..... } As you can see, cobertura add one more interface for my decorator. When OpenEJB load and deploy this instrumented class, a error is reported: Caused by: org.apache.webbeans.exception.WebBeansConfigurationException: Decorator : MyDecorator, Name:null, WebBeans Type:DECORATOR, API Types:[org.apache.commo ns.configuration.Configuration,net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.HasBeenInstrumented,org.apache.commons.configuration.AbstractConfiguration,MyDecorator,org.apache.commons.configuration.event.EventSource,java.lang.Object], Qualifiers:[javax.enterprise.inject.Any,javax.enterprise.inject.Default] delegate at tribute must implement all of the decorator decorated types, but decorator type interface net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.HasBeenInstrumented is not assignable from deleg ate type of interface org.apache.commons.configuration.Configuration The error log say that the @Decorator and the @Delegate should implement the same types.

Then i try to instrument the org.apache.commons.configuration.AbstractConfiguration and org.apache.commons.configuration.Configuration. (by instrument the commons-configuration-1.9.jar by cobertura command line) And modify my code like: @Decorator public class MyDecorator extends AbstractConfiguration { @Inject
@Delegate
private AbstractConfiguration conf;
 ..... } //I use AbstractConfiguration instead of Configuration, because the Configuration is an //interface which could not be instrumented. After all of this,the problem is solved. But it is not a good way to do this. The root cause is maven cobertura plugin identify the class file is instrumented by adding an interface to the original class, i works for most of the cases. But not for a @Decorator bean which running in an container. Should i create an comments for maven-cobertura-plugin org? Any one has some suggestion on how to unit test @Decorators.And easy to get coverage report? May be my unit test is not implement in the good way, maybe the openejb is not good for this? Normally how do you unit test your @Decorators?

@TITLE:Use static or context sensitive VPD policies to limit table access of a specific user?
@CONTENT:Let's assume there are two database users: (1) A user named APP who connects to the database very often and queries and modifies many tables in his own schema. (2) A user named WEB who only connects to the database rarely and only queries and modifies a few tables in the APP schema. I need to limit the table access of both users depending on the data. I'm using the Oracle Virtual Private Database (VPD) feature (sometimes also known as fine-grained access control) to do this. For this question only the rule which limits the APP user is important. The rule which limits the WEB user needs to be in a seperate VPD policy (I might later ask a similar question for that policy). Which of the following two implementations would give the better query and DML performance for the APP user? 1) Create the policy with policy_type dbms_rls.SHARED_CONTEXT_SENSITIVE and implement the policy function like this: FUNCTION get_predicate(i_schema IN VARCHAR2, i_object IN VARCHAR2)
RETURN VARCHAR2
AS
BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER') = 'WEB' THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;

  RETURN 'some_id_column = SYS_CONTEXT(''APP'', ''some_id'')';
END get_predicate;
 2) Create the policy with policy_type dbms_rls.SHARED_STATIC and implement the policy function like this: FUNCTION get_predicate(i_schema IN VARCHAR2, i_object IN VARCHAR2)
RETURN VARCHAR2
AS
BEGIN
  RETURN 'SYS_CONTEXT(''USERENV'', ''SESSION_USER'') = ''WEB'' OR some_id_column = SYS_CONTEXT(''APP'', ''some_id'')';
END get_predicate;
 Note that the APP user uses client connection pooling (provided by ODP.NET), so it should only open a few connections for each application usage session. There are around 100 clients which will connect to the database.
@CODE:dbms_rls.SHARED_CONTEXT_SENSITIVE FUNCTION get_predicate(i_schema IN VARCHAR2, i_object IN VARCHAR2)
RETURN VARCHAR2
AS
BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER') = 'WEB' THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;

  RETURN 'some_id_column = SYS_CONTEXT(''APP'', ''some_id'')';
END get_predicate; dbms_rls.SHARED_STATIC FUNCTION get_predicate(i_schema IN VARCHAR2, i_object IN VARCHAR2)
RETURN VARCHAR2
AS
BEGIN
  RETURN 'SYS_CONTEXT(''USERENV'', ''SESSION_USER'') = ''WEB'' OR some_id_column = SYS_CONTEXT(''APP'', ''some_id'')';
END get_predicate;

@CONTENT:I am trying some simple scripting with Amira, which uses TCL but I cannot assure that it's the standard version. I want to read a property from an object and assign it to another object. In the command window the procedure would be the following: Image1 getTransform 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Image2 setTransform 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 I want to do the same without manually copy pasting the result of getTransform The following do not work (taht is to say setTransform is executed without arguments) Image2 setTransform [Image1 getTransform] 
 or set myT=Image1 getTransform
Image2 setTransform $myT 
 I am sure I just need to appropriately use $ [ { , but what I've tried so far has not given any result

@TITLE:Cookie array for Recently Viewed - need to extract data from array and cap cookie to 5 IDs
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a recently viewed feature to a website. The idea is that you have a box in the right nav that shows your last 3 products viewed. You don't need to be logged it and it's no problem if the user clears cookies, it just starts over. From what I've researched, the best way to do this is through a cookie array (as opposed to setting 5 cookies or keep adding cookies or doing something in mysql). I'm having 2 problems: First, the array keeps adding values, I want it to cap it at 3 values and from there drop the oldest, then add the newest. So, if you visited 7 product page IDs in this order: 100,200,300,400,500,600,150, the cookie should store the values (500,600,150). The first is the oldest of the 3, the last is the newest. Second, I'm unclear of how to extract the array into something usable. The array is of ID numbers that I guess I need to query against the DB. When I put this on the page: COOKIE:  <?php echo $cookie; ?>
 I get this: COOKIE: a:7:i:0;s:3:"100";i:1;s:3:"200";i:2;s:3:"300";i:3;s:3:"400";i:4;s:3:"500";i:5;s:3:"600";i:6;s:3:"150";}
 This is my code: //set product id
$product_id = [//some stuff here sets the product id]
// if the cookie exists, read it and unserialize it. If not, create a blank array
if(array_key_exists('recentviews', $_COOKIE)) {
    $cookie = $_COOKIE['recentviews'];
    $cookie = unserialize($cookie);
} else {
    $cookie = array();
}

// add the value to the array and serialize
$cookie[] = $product_id;
$cookie = serialize($cookie);

// save the cookie
setcookie('recentviews', $cookie, time()+3600);
 How do I first get the cookie to hold 3 values and drop the oldest? What is the best way to extract those IDs into something I can put into a query?....str_replace? This brings up another question, which is should I just put the URL, anchor text, and a couple of attributes of the product into the cookie and not look it up with php/mysql? As always, thanks in advance.
@CODE:COOKIE:  <?php echo $cookie; ?> COOKIE: a:7:i:0;s:3:"100";i:1;s:3:"200";i:2;s:3:"300";i:3;s:3:"400";i:4;s:3:"500";i:5;s:3:"600";i:6;s:3:"150";} //set product id
$product_id = [//some stuff here sets the product id]
// if the cookie exists, read it and unserialize it. If not, create a blank array
if(array_key_exists('recentviews', $_COOKIE)) {
    $cookie = $_COOKIE['recentviews'];
    $cookie = unserialize($cookie);
} else {
    $cookie = array();
}

// add the value to the array and serialize
$cookie[] = $product_id;
$cookie = serialize($cookie);

// save the cookie
setcookie('recentviews', $cookie, time()+3600); $_COOKIE['recentviews'][1] == $product1_id; $_COOKIE['recentviews'][2] = $product2_id;$_COOKIE['recentviews'][3] = $product3_id;

@CONTENT:Google spreadsheets have a possibility to create forms that allows you to post data to the spreadsheet. This is not done via the Google API. I'm using the following code to post data to the form: <?php
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL,$googleformURL);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, FALSE);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6");

$data = curl_exec ($ch);
curl_close($ch);
//echo $data;
//Redirect to your thank you page

?>
 This works fine, however, when I look at the data in Google Spreadsheets, all special characters, such as ??? are missing. I'm guessing this is a encoding error.

@TITLE:Change chart range based on condition
@CONTENT:Question on dynamic range selection for chart of excel. Hope someone can help me out. I have a tabular data in excel sheet from B27:F41. This data will expand and contract on both sides ie rows and even columns will increase/ decrease. Q1.My biggest table will be B27:CZ120. Is it possible I give the biggest range and chart will ignore all empty rows and columns? or atleast empty columns. Q2. If above is not possible then how can I change the range from a macro. Reg. question 2 - Consider that in macro I already know the range for which data is present. I just want to pass this range to CHART RANGE. Found some explanation here but it is only for dynamic number of rows and not columns. Let me know in case more information is needed. Thanks

@TITLE:Gridview, hide button on RowDataBound?
@CONTENT:Very quick question - I must not be seeing it properly, but is there any reason why the ASP button "btnEdit" is still visible in the gridview? On RowDatabound (for testing) I'm just trying to hide it with the plan to put an if statement around it later. Code behind (RowDataBound)     protected void gvEditUser_RowDataBound(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e)

        btnEdit.Visible = false;
        if (e.Row.RowState != null)
        {
            if ((e.Row.RowState & DataControlRowState.Edit) > 0)
            {

@LINK:/questions/14598327/string-encoding-vb6-c-dll
@TITLE:String encoding VB6 / C++ dll
@CONTENT:I am having a problem with some characters in 2 strings that my program uses. String #1 is filled using VB code that gets data from a 3rd party application. String #2 gets similar data from the same 3rd party application, but it gets it with a C++ dll and sends it to VB. The data has some weird symbols in it. I don't know a whole lot about encoding and different character sets, but I'll try to explain it the best I can. I will use "?" as my example character. "?" (note this isnt a normal capital t) it is unicode decimal value 1058 http://www.unicodemap.org/details/0x0422/index.html When this character appears in String #1 during runtime it appears as "?", which I believe is just what VB6 does to show some unicode characters. When I use AscW on the character it returns the correct value of 1058. When I output the string to a text file, it appears as "?". The same character in String #2 from the C++ DLL appears as 2 characters "??" When I output that string to a text file, the character appears properly as "?". I was only outputting things to text files for testing purposes. I only need the 2 strings to be encoded / appear the same during run time. Any idea whats going on here? Any way for me to get weird characters to appear the same in both strings? Thanks edit: also the C++ dll is in multi character set and sends the data in a BSTR string CODE IN C++ DLL allChat is a CString BSTR Message;
int len = allChat.GetLength();
Message = SysAllocStringByteLen ((LPCTSTR)allChat,len+1);
 Message is returned to the VB app.. and nothing happens to the string after that. String #1 is just a regular VB string
@CODE:BSTR Message;
int len = allChat.GetLength();
Message = SysAllocStringByteLen ((LPCTSTR)allChat,len+1);

@LINK:/questions/14596841/websocket-new-frame-byte
@TITLE:Websocket new frame byte
@CONTENT:I am currently writing a Visual Basic script that opens a TcpListener on local machine ip (127.0.0.1) and on port 8181. I connect to my websocket server (via the AcceptSocket method) from Google Chrome. From Chrome i do a send request to the server and the server can read it and everything. When I send the message back (like an echo) I can send it the first time but the second time I get an error: Received unexpected continuation frame. What i need is a CByte that tells the frame to start a new one or end the open one (without closing the socket connection) Is this achieveable and if so what is the solution? I call the Sub with SendMessage(sck, "test") Here is the code for my message sender: Sub SendMessage(sck As Socket, message As String)
    Dim rawData = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)
    Dim frameCount = 0
    Dim frame(10) As Byte
    frame(0) = CByte(129)

    If rawData.Length <= 125 Then
        frame(1) = CByte(rawData.Length)
        frameCount = 2
    ElseIf rawData.Length >= 126 AndAlso rawData.Length <= 65535 Then
        frame(1) = CByte(126)
        Dim len = CByte(rawData.Length)
        frame(2) = CByte(((len >> 8) & CByte(255)))
        frame(3) = CByte((len & CByte(255)))
        frameCount = 4
    Else
        frame(1) = CByte(127)
        Dim len = CByte(rawData.Length)
        frame(2) = CByte(((len >> 56) & CByte(255)))
        frame(3) = CByte(((len >> 48) & CByte(255)))
        frame(4) = CByte(((len >> 40) & CByte(255)))
        frame(5) = CByte(((len >> 32) & CByte(255)))
        frame(6) = CByte(((len >> 24) & CByte(255)))
        frame(7) = CByte(((len >> 16) & CByte(255)))
        frame(8) = CByte(((len >> 8) & CByte(255)))
        frame(9) = CByte((len & CByte(255)))
        frameCount = 10
    End If
    Dim bLength = frameCount + rawData.Length
    Console.WriteLine(frameCount)
    Console.WriteLine(rawData.Length)
    Dim reply(bLength + 1) As Byte

    Dim bLim = 0
    For i = 0 To frameCount - 1
        Console.WriteLine(bLim)
        reply(bLim) = frame(i)
        bLim += 1
    Next

    For i = 0 To rawData.Length - 1
        Console.WriteLine(bLim)
        reply(bLim) = rawData(i)
        bLim += 1
    Next
    For i = 0 To reply.Length - 1
        Console.WriteLine("Byte: " & reply(i))
        Console.WriteLine("Char: " & CByte(reply(i)))
    Next
    sck.Send(reply, reply.Length, 0)
End Sub
 Update: After changing the line Dim reply(bLength + 1) As Byte to Dim reply(bLength) As Byte i dont get the continuous frame error, but instead i get a new error: A server must not mask any frames that it sends to the client. Hopefully this information can point to the problem. Update 2: Below is the entire client Sub the does everything with the clients. From accept to handshake to message stuff. Private Sub clientStarter(ByVal sck As Socket)
    Dim netStream As New NetworkStream(sck)
    Dim netReader As New IO.StreamReader(netStream)

                message = Nothing
            End If
        End While
    End While
End Sub
 Update 3 (solution): I have figured out my problem. By changing frame(1) = CByte(rawData.Length) to frame(1) = CByte(rawData.Length + 1) it incorperates the end 0 byte and now the proper length of the message is correct and rids me of my masking problem. I guess the end of the message byte is supposed to be included in the message length.
@CODE:Received unexpected continuation frame. SendMessage(sck, "test") Sub SendMessage(sck As Socket, message As String)
    Dim rawData = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)
    Dim frameCount = 0
    Dim frame(10) As Byte
    frame(0) = CByte(129)

    If rawData.Length <= 125 Then
        frame(1) = CByte(rawData.Length)
        frameCount = 2
    ElseIf rawData.Length >= 126 AndAlso rawData.Length <= 65535 Then
        frame(1) = CByte(126)

@CONTENT:So I have a scenario like this with classes Student and Course Student A is enrolled in Course 1, 2 Student B is enrolled in Course 1, 2, 3 Student C is enrolled in Course 2 So there are two kinds of events: Student A is deleted -> need to notify two objects: Course 1 and Course 2 Course 1 is canceled -> need to notify two objects: Student A and Student B I know that the Observer pattern can work if each Student can be only enrolled in 1 Course, in which case I have a list of Student for each Course object in the Observer Pattern. I am wondering if I should do some two way Observer Pattern (Student keeps a list of Courses and the Course also keeps a list of students). So would be a good way to deal with this problem? Main concern is speed/space tradeoff (what I can think of at best now is a two way hash/tree from 1 Student to 1 set of Courses and 1 Course to 1 set of Students). Any pointer will be appreciated!!

 and public interface class MyInterface {

};
==> error C2849: 'MyInterface' : an interface cannot have a destructor
 Yet it cannot be that such inheritance is categorically forbidden in Windows Runtime, because some system-provided interfaces do inherit from IClosable -- for example, IInputStream. I suppose I could define MyInterface in IDL instead and convert it into an external .winmd file with midlrt.exe before I compile the C++ code. That would be an unwelcome compilcation of my build process, though. Is there a way to specify this as C++/CX source?

@TITLE:Issue with Cookies (PHP)
@CONTENT:I'm having a realing strange issue. Well, on my website i have a feedback and comment system, both use cookies to prevent people send a lot of comments (mass spam), blocking write a comment or feedback a post for example 30 seconds. If they disable cookies they can't comment or feedback. I use the system with a JQuery script using an process in PHP to don't refresh the page. First problem - For some reason, on localhost (hosted in my house) it works fine, blocking people. But on host, if i upload the scripts (if i want to do an update, for example), it stops work, i can comment as much as i want, it will not block. But it's just on my computer (as i tested, on my brother's notebook and at my work works fine) I also tested on IE, Firefox and Chrome. But after some days (random, 1-4) it starts to work fine. But if i update the script (even don't changing THAT script), backs the issue. Second problem - On vote (feedback) and comment system, if the 'block system' works fine, it will block the user for 30 seconds. But, when i submit the comment, clicking very fast at the first second, it will submit twice. Like, do 2/3 (sometimes 4) times the same comment. But if i try to comment again before the 30 seconds, it will block. How can i prevent people do duplicates submits? Here is some codes to you, it should help. comments.php if (isset($_COOKIE["AbleCookie"])) //prevent disabled cookies
{
    if (!isset($_COOKIE["time"])) //verify if the cookie time (to block comment) has been set
    {
        if (strlen($Comentario) != 0)
        {
            if (strlen($Comentario <= 500))

@TITLE:Serializing/deserializing partial XML files
@CONTENT:I'm dealing with a number of large descriptive XML files that I only need to read the outer most elements, change the values and then save it out again. As an example - <Model Name="someModel">
    <Material Name="someMaterial" Effect="someEffect">
        <Texture Name="tex1" Path="somePath"/>
        <Colour Name="colour1" Value="FFF"/>
        <Layer Index="0"/>
        ... many more elements I don't are about
    </Material>
</Model>
 I want to deserialize the above, change a Material attribute, and then save it back out again. But as I don't care about Materials elements (just its attributes), I'd rather not have to add them all to the class Im deserialzing too, .. however, I need them to still be written back out when I save.

@TITLE:PowerMTA Config Override for Return-Path for Virtual MTA
@CONTENT:Our setup uses OEM Pro to drop the emails into a PowerMTA pickup directory. OEM Pro only allows us to specify one global catch all domain. This global catch all domain is being used as the return-path and the return-path is what has to be verified by the SPF record lookup. So this is not an ideal situation since we would like each client to have their own SPF records, and have their domain in the return-path. We have deduced that our best approach would be to configure PowerMTA to override the return-path address, is it possible to configure this the PMTA config for a Virtual MTA?

Is there a way to target messages to only specific users? I want the chat room moderator to have the chance to reject inappropriate posts.

@TITLE:Protected View in Microsoft Excel 2010 and Python
@CONTENT:No code examples here. Just running into an issue with Microsoft Excel 2010 where I have a python script on linux that pulls data from csv files, pushes it into excel, and emails that file to a certain email address as an attachment. My problem is that I'm using formulas in my excel file, and when it first opens up it goes into "Protected View". My formulas don't load until after I click "Enable Editing". Is there anyway to get my numbers to show up even if Protected Mode is on?

@LINK:/questions/14592052/passing-a-byte-pointer-to-a-c-sharp-method-via-reverse-pinvoke
@TITLE:Passing a byte pointer to a C# method via reverse PInvoke
@CONTENT:In the past, I have passed a byte array from a C# method to an unmanaged C++ function. I am now trying to pass a pointer to a buffer of type unsigned char from a C++ method back into a C# method using reverse PInvoke, which uses a callback to get back to the C# code. I have tried several different ideas - like passing Ref Byte, Byte *, and IntPtr for the 2nd argument, but none of them seem to work. Here is my test code for using IntPtr: C# code: namespace TestPInvoke
{
   class Program
   {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
         foo f = new foo();
         f.DispMsg();
      }
   }

   unsafe public class foo
   {
      public delegate void callback(int NumBytes, IntPtr pBuf);

      public static void callee(int NumBytes, IntPtr pBuf)
      {
         System.Console.WriteLine("NumBytes = " + NumBytes.ToString() + ", pBuf = ");
         String s = "";
         Byte* p = (Byte*)pBuf.ToPointer();
         for (int Loop = 0; Loop < 50; Loop++)
         {
            s += p++->ToString() + "  ";
         }
         System.Console.WriteLine(s);
      }

      public void DispMsg()
      {
         caller(new callback(foo.callee));
      }

      [DllImport(@"C:\Users\Bob\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\AttackPoker1\Win32Client\TestPInvoke\bin\Debug\TestPInvokeDLLCPP.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.StdCall)]
      public static extern void caller(callback call);
   }
 } C++ code: #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef unsigned char Byte;

typedef void (__stdcall *callback)(const int bytesInMsg, Byte* pintBuf);

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void __stdcall caller(callback call)
{
   // Debug Test on how to pass a pointer to a byte buffer to a C# method.
   Byte* pBuf = new Byte[50];
   // Initialize the buffer to something.
   Byte* p = pBuf;
   for (Byte Loop = 0; Loop < 50; Loop++)
      *p = Loop;
   // Initiate the callback into the C# code.
   call(50, pBuf);
   // Delete pBuf later.
}
 When the C++ code calls the C# callback callee method, the bytesInMsg argument is correct. But, the returned pointer does not point to the start of the buffer. Dereferencing the pointer always seems to point to the last value in the buffer (49 or 0x31), but after looking at it in the memory window, the rest of the bytes both before and after are garbage. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get this to work without marshaling a large array? What I'm hoping to do is pass a pointer to a large buffer created on the C++ side one time to a C# class that will then be able to read data from that buffer efficiently. If this can not be done, then I will have to allocate the memory buffers from C#, pin them, and pass them into the C++ methods.
@CODE:namespace TestPInvoke
{
   class Program
   {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
         foo f = new foo();
         f.DispMsg();
      }
   }

   unsafe public class foo
   {
      public delegate void callback(int NumBytes, IntPtr pBuf);

         String s = "";
         Byte* p = (Byte*)pBuf.ToPointer();
         for (int Loop = 0; Loop < 50; Loop++)
         {
            s += p++->ToString() + "  ";
         }

I wrote this but it does not work: using this ->How to split one string into multiple variables in bash shell? while read name hash

 Whats should I be doing instead? Thank you in advance. EDIT: Thanks guys, so I changed it to this, it is easier to read. I thought, it was going to resolve my errors, but there are still there...damn it. So basically, in script.sh, here is the first part: cd ~/Music/Youtube\ Playlist/Playlists/$name

mv $HOME/Music/Youtube\ Playlist/Playlists/$name/TextRecords/lastoutput.txt $HOME/Music/Youtube\ Playlist/Playlists/lastoutput.txt
 However, the shell returns the error: mv: cannot stat `/home/kabaka/Music/Youtube Playlist/Playlists//TextRecords/lastoutput.txt': No such file or directory
 That means that where there should the name of a playlist, there is nothing. Do you have any idea why? Is it because $name in my current script and $name in the script above are not the same? Notice that I have the same thing happening for $hash, which should appear in an url but is just blank
@CODE:while read name hash
do

        sh script.sh "$name" "$hash"

@TITLE:Change valueField config on Ext-JS combobox?
@CONTENT:I have a combobox on a form where I need to reset its store along with the 'displayField' and 'valueField' configs. Resetting the store via cmb.bindStore(newStore) works great. Setting cmb.displayField = 'newfieldname'; also works great. However, cmb.valueField = 'newValField'; does not work. The combo displays the right stuff, but when i select an item, the value is using the old valueField value, not the new one. I've tried: doing a cmb.reset() afterwards Ext.apply(...) Is it because valueField is somehow special because it is a required field? Is there some special way to set a config value on an Ext-JS component I don't know about or is it just not possible to change the value of 'valueField'? FYI - Here is my code:     comp.bindStore(Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {

@TITLE:unordered_map adding returns to strings read in from a file c++
@CONTENT:I have a text file, formatted: "stringx, stringy"
"stringx, stringy" 
 e.t.c. I have put my code below to show how I'm reading into my unordered map, parsing the text and making stringx the key with stringy the value. For the problem I am trying to solve I need to also have another map, in the reverse order i.e key being stringy, and value being stringx. The values are getting entered correctly, when i output straightData, you see "stringx:stringy" 
 but when i output reverseData, it's instead "stringy
 :stringx" 
 I don't know if this is an issue for the overall scope of my program (i need to get one key, append it to a list, and then take the value from the key and use that to lookup another key/value pair). I'm just thinking however, if it automatically has a newline in the data, would stringx
 be the same as (space)
stringx
 ? I don't know if i'm even making sense, but as always all help would be massively appreciated! typedef unordered_map<string, string> mymap;

@LINK:/questions/14590295/use-net-dll-as-com
@TITLE:Use .NET dll as COM
@CONTENT:I have a somewhat convoluted issue where I need to call a WCF web service from a SQL Server 2005 stored procedure. While researching I discovered that the only version of .NET SQL Server 2005 will natively support it 2.0 - yet I needed to use a client to consume the web service written for .NET 4. After playing around with some workaround to try to get SQL Server to recognize a .NET 4 DLL I decided to simply create a .NET 2 CLR stored procedure and use a wrapper class written in .NET 4 exposed as COM in order to call my web service. I found several guides dealing with how to use a .NET 4 dll with .NET 2 as a COM dll (link, link) yet am still struggling. My "wrapper class" (.NET 4) looks like this: namespace Wrapper
{
    [Guid("4C1D992C-4965-49B2-A694-33810A3B9775")]
    [ComVisible(true)]
    public class WrapperClass
    {
         public bool Process(Guid ID)
         {
         }
    }
}
 I've added the app.manifest file as suggested by the second link above. However, when I add the generated DLL to my .NET 2 sql server project, it fails to build with the following message: 1>c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(1578,5): Warning:  MSB3274: The primary reference "Wrapper" could not be resolved because it was built against the ".NETFramework,Version=v4.0" framework. This is a higher version than the currently targeted framework ".NETFramework,Version=v2.0".
 What am I doing wrong here? I tried not adding the DLL as a reference at all but then the code does not even compile. Alternatively, is there another (easier) way I can approach this issue? EDIT: I can't directly add a web reference either:
@CODE:namespace Wrapper
{
    [Guid("4C1D992C-4965-49B2-A694-33810A3B9775")]
    [ComVisible(true)]
    public class WrapperClass
    {
         public bool Process(Guid ID)
         {
         }
    }
} 1>c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(1578,5): Warning:  MSB3274: The primary reference "Wrapper" could not be resolved because it was built against the ".NETFramework,Version=v4.0" framework.

I have 3 models(Card, Deck, PlayingCard) My Deck model is responsible for randomising the cards and here are the codes. Deck.h #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "Card.h"

@interface Deck : NSObject
- (void)addCard:(Card *)card atTop:(BOOL)atTop;

- (Card *)drawRandomCard;

@end
 Deck.m #import "Deck.h"
@interface Deck()

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSMutableArray *cards;

@end

@implementation Deck
-(NSMutableArray *)cards
{
    if(!_cards) _cards =[[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    return _cards;
} 

- (void)addCard:(Card *)card atTop:(BOOL)atTop
{
    if(card){
        if(atTop){
            [self.cards insertObject:card atIndex:0];
        }
        else
        {
            [self.cards addObject:card];
        }
    }
} 

- (Card *)drawRandomCard
{
    Card *randomCard = nil;  

    if(self.cards.count){
        unsigned index = arc4random() % self.cards.count;
        randomCard = self.cards[index];
        [self.cards removeObjectAtIndex:index];
    }

    return randomCard;
}
@end
 My PlayingCard basically describes the contents of a Card. for eg. Jack of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds where Jack would be the "rank" of the card and "hearts" would be the suit of the card which together form the contents of the card. PlayingCard.h #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "Card.h"
@interface PlayingCard : NSObject

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *suit;
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger   rank;

+ (NSArray *) validSuits;
+ (NSUInteger) maxRank;

- (NSString *)contents;
@end
 PlayingCard.m #import "PlayingCard.h"

@implementation PlayingCard

- (NSString *)contents
{
    NSArray *rankStrings = [PlayingCard rankStrings];
    return [rankStrings[self.rank] stringByAppendingString:self.suit];
}

@synthesize suit = _suit;

+(NSArray *)validSuits{
    return @[@"?", @"?", @"?", @"?"] ;
}

+(NSArray *)rankStrings{
    return  @[@ "?", @"A", @"2", @"3", @"4", @"5", @"6", @"7", @"8", @"9",@"10", @"J", @"Q", @"K"];

}
-(void)setSuit:(NSString *)suit
{
    if([[PlayingCard validSuits] containsObject:suit]){
        _suit = suit;
    }
}

-(NSString *)suit{
    return _suit ? _suit: @"?";
}

+ (NSUInteger)maxRank {
    return [self rankStrings].count-1;
}

-(void)setRank:(NSUInteger)rank{
    if(rank <= [PlayingCard maxRank]) {
        _rank = rank;
    }
}
@end
 Finally my ViewController.m #import "CardGameViewController.h"
#import "Card.h"
#import "Deck.h"
#import "PlayingCard.h"

@interface CardGameViewController ()
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *flipsLabel;
@property (nonatomic) int flipCount;
@property (nonatomic) NSString *title;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *cardRandom;
@end

@implementation CardGameViewController

- (void)setFlipCount:(int)flipCount
{
    _flipCount = flipCount;
    self.flipsLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@" Flips:%d", self.flipCount ];
}

- (IBAction)flipCard:(UIButton *)sender
{

    if(sender.isSelected) {
        sender.selected = NO;
        self.flipCount ++;
    }
    else{
        sender.selected = YES;
        self.flipCount ++;         
    }
}

@end
 I researched about this and i found that I should probably use - (void)setTitle:(NSString *)title forState:(UIControlState)state
 where the state will be UIControlStateSelected because the front of the card containing the contents is the selected content of the button but I dont know how to set the title according to the random card content developed by my model.

@LINK:/questions/14588167/android-rss-reader-cuts-off-after-first-pragraph
@TITLE:Android RSS Reader cuts off after first pragraph
@CONTENT:I am creating an app for my school newspaper and am running into a problem when trying to display the full article. Currently I have a list of articles appear that are pulled from an RSS feed, and when one is clicked on it brings up the content of the article. However only the first paragraph displays in the TextView, no matter how long it is. This leads me too believe that it has something to do with the <p></p> HTML tags. I am not that familiar with RSS feeds or parsing XML(this being my first time trying it)and have looked around for ways to do what I'm trying to accomplish. From: Android TextView cuts off after one paragraph I am creating this question based on results of the above question. I thought the problem with my app had something to do with the TextView and it's properties but by using plain text that I hard coded in it operates just fine. Based on the comments and things that I tried, the problem appears to be with how the app is reading information from the RSS feed. Like I said before this is my first time working with RSS feeds in Android, and I am using a sample projects code(can be found in the previous questions). Below is the code relevant to the RSS feed: RSSFeed.java: public class RSSFeed {

    private String link = null;
    private String pubdate = null;
    private String content = null;

    RSSFeed(){
        itemList = new Vector<RSSItem>(0);
    }

    void addItem(RSSItem item){
        itemList.add(item);
    }

    RSSItem getItem(int location){
        return itemList.get(location);
    }

    List<RSSItem> getList(){
        return itemList;
    }

Flurry works fine from within Java part, but crashes from within C++. More specifically, call jni_env->FindClass("com/flurry/android/FlurryAgent");
 results in ClassNotFoundException. jni_env variable is not broken because I am able to get some Intent params using it. FlurryAgent.jar is added to libs dir and into .classpath. I've even checked 'Order and Export' checkbox for FlurryAgent.jar (though I have no idea what does it mean). Nothing helps. One more detail: my application is divided into Library and App parts. I have added FlurryAgent.jar to both parts and checked 'Order and Export' in both parts, but it still does not help. Clean & rebuild does does not help either. Did I miss something?

@LINK:/questions/14586739/checking-if-a-timeslot-booking-is-taken
@TITLE:Checking if a timeslot/booking is taken
@CONTENT:EDIT: The query Gordon posted appears to have a problem. If I have a booking from 10-12 it seems to consider all bookings past 12 pm invalid, but all bookings before 10am valid. Some quick and simple thinking ended up in me creating the following query: SELECT serverip 
        FROM   server 
        WHERE  serverip NOT IN (SELECT serverip 
                                FROM   booking 
                                WHERE  startat >= datehere 
                                AND expiresat <= datehere) 
        LIMIT  1; 
 Suppose the booking table stores the following: +-----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------+
| bookingid | serverip  | username | startat  | expiresat |
+-----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------+
|         1 | 127.0.0.1 | testuser | 10:00    | 12:00     |
+-----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------+
 If the user was to input the following data for a booking: startat = 9:59
expiresat = 12:01
 They could easily bypass my check to see if the booking time is available based on previous bookings stored. Any advice on how I could better solve this problem? I would prefer NOT to limit the users input and would like to avoid hard coding specific time slots, if that wasn't a problem however I would stick with what I've got. Thanks for your time.

@TITLE:Specs for controller inside a module (versionist)
@CONTENT:I'm creating an API in Rails and I use versionist to handle versions. I want to test API controllers, but I'm unable to create a valid request. My controller:  class Api::V1::ItemsController < Api::V1::BaseController    
  def index
    render json:'anything'
  end
end
 My spec: describe Api::V1::ItemsController do
  describe "#create" do
    it "shows items" do
      get :index, format: :json
    end
  end
end
 routes.rb: scope '/api' do
  api_version(:module => "Api::V1", :path => {:value => "v1"}, :default => true) do
    resources :items

 The test doesn't check anything. Still, it raises an error:  Failure/Error: get :index, format: :json
 ActionController::RoutingError:
   No route matches {:format=>:json, :controller=>"api/v1/items", :action=>"index"}
 I suppose that there is something wrong with the :controller key in the request, but I don't know how to fix it...

@TITLE:How to adjust the speed of Objects moving over a 2D playing field?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Tower Defence game and my main component is a grid divided into 40x40 fields (an Object of the Class Field). When the game starts the sortest way to the nearest base is found for every spawn (which is a special kind of field) and saved in its field int[] path, which represents a sequence of directions which the monster must follow to reach the base. I have created a thread that has a loop which moves every monster 1px forward and increases its field distance in each pass. Every time the monster moves I also check if it hasn't stepped on the center of a field. I do it using: if ((monster.getDistance() % FIELD_SIZE /*which is 40*/) == 0)
 And when it returns 0 the monster changes its direction (reading the position of the next field to reach from its spawn field path). This works when every enemy moves 1px per pass. But I want them to move with different speed. I found 2 solutions: Move every enemy in a different thread. The higher it's speed is, the shorter would be the Thread.sleep() duration. Move them in loop with different distance. I prefer the 2. solution but don't know how to implement it. My problem is that most of themonsters would never step on the center of a field and therfore never change direction. If a monster would move with 0.33 speed the distances covered would be: 0.33, 0.66, 0.99 (...) 39.63 (...) 40.13. So it would never reach 40. If i would use ceil, round or floor then it would reach 40 but multiple times what would cause an exception in my app. So my question is how to implement the moving with a float value as the distance and provide that it would reach a multiple of 40 every time but just once per checking?

On completing the fields in panel 1 I click a link to reveal the 2nd panel and that has a save button on it. Once saved the document appears in the db correctly. The save buttons does a dds save and then clears all fields and does a partial update on the outer panel and a partial execute on that panel too as I have other dds on the XPage outside of my main panel. If I now create another document the previous document gets updated rather than create a new doc. I've tried different scope for the dds and other options. Not sure what to try next.

@CONTENT:I have a file with raw image data. Every pixel is represented as 16 bit (0-65536) value. I'm reading the needed part of data into an ushort[] array. After doing some image processing I need to show this image to the user somehow. I have no problem drawing an 8 bit grayscale (I just set every pixel's R, G and B values same), but can't handle 16 bit/pixel grayscale image. Another possibilty is to use PixelFormat.Format48bppRgb and set r,g and b to the same 16 bit grascale, but I couldn't find how. I've found some code snippets using unsafe code and LockBits, but couldn't get them to work. Is there any way to draw the 16 bit grayscale image without to downscale it to 8 bit? Please provide me with a code snippet. EDIT: this is how I set 8 bit grascales: Array img;
//var data = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, bmp.PixelFormat);
if (bitsPerElement == 8)
{
    //img = Array.CreateInstance(typeof(byte), bitmapHeigth*bitmapWidth);
    img = GetLayerBytes<byte>(LayerNum) as byte[];

@CONTENT:I adapted some code from here in order to detect orientation changes in my Phonegap app (to load different CSS files for landscape and portrait). I'm getting a "cannot read property 'content' of null error, implying there's something wrong with the DOM call. The code involves adding these psuedo elements to the primary CSS file: /*Orientation Detection Hack*/
body:after {
content: "";
position: absolute;
color: transparent;
}

@media all and (orientation: portrait) {
body:after {
content: "p";
    }
}

@media all and (orientation: landscape) {
  body:after {
    content: "l";
    }
}
/*end of orientation detection*/
 And this event listener to check the pseudo element on an orientation change: /*ORIENTATION CHANGES*/
    //get style of the body:after element
var bodyAfterStyle = window.getComputedStyle(document.body, ":after");

window.onorientationchange = function() {


  navigator.notification.alert(
        'ORIENTATION CHANGELOL',  // message
        'Credits',            // title
        'Credits');              // buttonName

  if(bodyAfterStyle.content == 'p') {

/*whatever
    navigator.notification.alert("Now in Portrait");
    var sheet = document.createElement('link');
    sheet.innerHTML = 'href=\"portrait.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"  type=\"text/css\"';
    document.body.appendChild(sheet);
end whatever*/
} 
    else if(bodyAfterStyle.content == 'l') {
    //do landscape stuff
  }
}
    /*END OF ORIENTATION STUFF*/

 What is the best way to do this? Query which i have tried is select * from TableName PIVOT (option for ID = 2674 )) as abc 
 this will not work since PIVOT expects aggregated function.. I have also tried COALESCE like this declare @t table(num VARCHAR(100))
insert into @t

select num from @t
declare @s varchar(8000)

@CONTENT:I am pretty new to XNA 4.0 and have a problem I can't seem to figure out. So far I have been detecting mouse clicks by creating rectangles and checking the rectangle.contains method, but what if I don't want to check inside a rectangle? In one part of my map I have a triangle button that I want to let the user click, but I want to only count it as a click if it is actually inside the triangle. If I create a rectangle around the triangle the user will be able to click outside the texture area, if you know what I mean. How do I go about doing this?

@TITLE:Wrong RecordCount on Filtered Form with SQL View DataSource
@CONTENT:I am using an Access2010 project as frontend, referring to a MS SQL Server 2008 as backend. Within my Access project there is form frmKlienten?bersicht. This form has a view abfKlienten?bersicht as dataSource. Now I am trying to get the current number of records showing up in my form by using this code: Private Sub Form_Current()
    Debug.Print "Form_Current: " & anzahlDatens?tze
    lblAnzahlDatens?tze.Caption = anzahlDatens?tze & " Klient(en)"
End Sub

Private Function anzahlDatens?tze() As Integer
    Dim rs As Recordset
    Set rs = Me.RecordsetClone
    rs.MoveLast
    anzahlDatens?tze = rs.RecordCount
End Function
 This works fine until I am using some filters. If I am using any filter on my form, the number of records stays unchanged! What do I have to change to get the current number of records showing up (if filtered or not)? What is the reason why my code does not show the correct number of records? EDIT: According to the given comments and answers I tried setting Count([pkKlient] onto a textbox (see new pic) and tried DCount("*", "abfKlienten?bersicht", me.Filter) from within VBA Code. Unfortunatelly it seems that the filterClause is not valid when using it as parameter value for DCount. (see pic for filterClause). As you can see count(..) does not result in a correct number - and the filterClause (generated by access!!) seems not to be valid for use by DCount(..) If someone wants to try it, on your own, just create an ADP, add a form, add a view, form dataSource is a view, set a filter, and try to get the number of records?!! Looking forward for any comments/answers/hints!
@CODE:frmKlienten?bersicht abfKlienten?bersicht Private Sub Form_Current()

@LINK:/questions/14581578/how-to-disable-function-keys-in-a-pdf-displayed-in-a-jsp-using-object-and-henc
@TITLE:How to disable function keys in a PDF displayed in a JSP using <object> and hence to (partially) prevent a Save?
@CONTENT:I use the following approach to display a PDF within a JSP: <object id="pdfObj" data='myController.do?#toolbar=0&amp;navpanes=0&amp;scrollbar=1&amp' type='application/pdf' width='100%' height='460px' onkeypress="javascript:alert('key press event not triggered!');"></object>
 The toolbar and the navigation panes are hidden when the screen loads. The floating toolbar also is not visible. However, an F8 or a F4 opens up the toolbar or the navigation pane respectively. An attempt on trapping the keypress or keydown event works for the rest of the screen but once I click within the PDF, the key press events are not captured and this results in the toolbar getting enabled. I understand that stopping the PDF displayed in the browser from getting saved is not possible, atleast without tha use of any plugin. However, my question here is more for preventing the function key press just to add one more layer that the user needs to go through to save the document. [Update] Accommodating @robertc's comment below, can we have a script to capture the function keys at the screen level before that gets handled by the application that handles the embedded object?
@CODE:<object id="pdfObj" data='myController.do?#toolbar=0&amp;navpanes=0&amp;scrollbar=1&amp' type='application/pdf' width='100%' height='460px' onkeypress="javascript:alert('key press event not triggered!');"></object>

@CONTENT:I have about 20 View Controllers, chained together with Modal and Push segues.

[self presentViewController:viewController animated:YES completion:nil];
 all of the previous view controllers are not unloaded. Not a single viewDidUnload method is called. How can this be done?

@LINK:/questions/14580766/why-can-i-access-controls-from-a-form-in-a-thread-without-cross-thread-exception
@TITLE:Why can I access controls from a form in a thread without cross thread exception?
@CONTENT:Usually, when you access controls in a Thread you end up with some cross thread exceptions. In my C# WinForms Application I have a picture box and a toolstriplabel which do not cause that exception. I don't understand why, can anybody explain this to me? Here some code explanation: In the main form I have a picturebox and a toolstriplabel. Also I have a reference to another Form, which has no controls and no additional source code. And then in the main form there is another object which works with a thread. This thread can raise three different events and the main form is subscribed to these three events. Event1 causes the toolstriplabel to update (with some information from the thread). Event2 causes the picturebox to update (with a new picture from the thread). Event1 and Event2 work perfectly fine. I do not use any invoke methods, I directly change Text and BackgroundImage properties without cross thread exception. Event3 though makes troubles. It is supposed to show the other form but I receive the cross therad exception. It works only if I use a BeginInvoke to show the form. Why is that? Edit: The multithreading is done by an MJPEGStream object. I subscribe the NewFrame method of that MJPEGStream object. public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    private CAM cam;

    private PeekWindow frmPeekWindow;

    public Form1()

@CONTENT:very common question and still did not find the right solution for this. I need to run cron job to start php script each morning to list all new files created on the web server during the night. This is very usefull to see what visitors have uploaded during the night and ofcourse very ofter those files could be harmful files that will hurt other visitors computers. So far I have this: $dir = "../root/";         
$pattern = '\.*$'; // check only file with these ext.              
$newstamp = 0;                
$newname = "";    
if ($handle = opendir($dir)) {                   
       while (false !== ($fname = readdir($handle)))  {                
         // Eliminate current directory, parent directory                
         if (ereg('^\.{1,2}$',$fname)) continue;                
         // Eliminate other pages not in pattern                
         if (! ereg($pattern,$fname)) continue;                
         $timedat = filemtime("$dir/$fname");                
         if ($timedat > $newstamp) {

            $newname = $fname;    
          }    
         }    
        }    
closedir ($handle);    

// $newstamp is the time for the latest file    
// $newname is the name of the latest file    
// print last mod.file - format date as you like                
print $newname . " - " . date( "Y/m/d", $newstamp);    
 this prints the newest file but only in one directory root/ and doesnt check for example root/folder/ and etc.. How to do it recusrsivly ? If I add a new file within root/folder the script will show me folder with date , but would not show which file in root/folder was created.. I hope you understand what I mean, thanks

@TITLE:Elastic Search equivalent of ¡§Scoping (Scalar Fields)¡¨ in sunspot/solr
@CONTENT:I'm exploring various options for a search engine for our rails-app/data. I was able to make sunspot/solr work and am currently exploring ElasticSearch as an alternative but couldn't get the same thing(scoping/filtering) to work under ES. I would like to filter/scope objects as described in the "Scoping" section in 'https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot'. I have an active record class 'Product'. class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
...

  include Tire::Model::Search
  include Tire::Model::Callbacks

  tire.mapping do
    indexes :name, :type => :string
    indexes :categories do
      indexes :id, :type => :integer
    end
  end
end
 Once I imported products into ES, the following query works and gives results Product.tire.search { query { string '*', default_operator: "AND", default_field: "name" } }.results
 How do I get products of a particular category given a category id ? Product.tire.search { query { string '*', default_operator: "AND", default_field: "name" }; filter(:term, 'categories.id' => 38) }.results
 I'm basically looking for the tire equivalent for the following sunspot call: Product.search do
  with(:category_ids, 38)
end
 with the following in the Product class searchable :auto_index => true, :auto_remove => true do
  text :name

  integer :category_ids, :multiple => true do
     self.categories.map &:id
  end

end
@CODE:class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
...

  include Tire::Model::Search
  include Tire::Model::Callbacks

  tire.mapping do
    indexes :name, :type => :string
    indexes :categories do
      indexes :id, :type => :integer
    end
  end
end Product.tire.search { query { string '*', default_operator: "AND", default_field: "name" } }.results Product.tire.search { query { string '*', default_operator: "AND", default_field: "name" }; filter(:term, 'categories.id' => 38) }.results Product.search do
  with(:category_ids, 38)
end searchable :auto_index => true, :auto_remove => true do
  text :name

  integer :category_ids, :multiple => true do
     self.categories.map &:id
  end

end with filter

@TITLE:single quotes appear arround value after running copy in postgres 9.2
@CONTENT:I am new to postgres and I play around with data loading. Here is the table definition from postgres 9.2 spec: CREATE TABLE weather (
    city varchar(80),
    temp_lo int, -- low temperature
    temp_hi int, -- high temperature
    prcp real, -- precipitation
    date date
 );
 I prepared the following data file (weather.txt): San Francisco   43  57  0.0 '1994-11-29'
Hayward 54  37  0.0 '1994-11-29'
 and ran the COPY command: COPY weather FROM '~aviad/postsgres/playground/weather.txt';
 now, when I run select * from weather; I see that single quotes appears around the city values. This does not happen when I run simple INSERT e.g: INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('San Francisco', 46, 50, 0.25, '1994-11-27');
 I wonder: what what is the reason for wrapping text values by single quotes? What is the correct way to put the text data in the file used by COPY to avoid single quote wrapping?

@TITLE:How to create links from existing text in Greasemonkey?
@CONTENT:I think I'm just having too much trouble understanding how to use regex and creating links... I'm working on a Greasemonkey script for a virtual pet game that will create links to the wiki for each creature listed on a certain page. The problem is, new pets get added to the page all the time so I can't just hardcode the links into the script. I need to search for the creatures names and then make it a link... You can view the target page without signing up. Sample source code from the target page: <tr>
    <td>Flizzard</td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Fluff</td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./images/icons/yes.png" /></td>

    <td align="center"><a href="accomplishments.php?family=Fluff&acc=herd"><img src="./images/icons/no.png" border="0" /></a></td>
</tr>  
 . . "Flizzard" and "Fluff" would be what I want to turn into links... I found this and started working on it, and it might work, except it doesn't seem to say where to start the match (in a way that makes sense to me anyways), and I have NO clue what to put in (The-Identifier-That-Denotes-End-Of-Text-Of-Interest) var html = document.body.innerHTML;
html = html.replace( /(http://wiki.unicreatures.com/index.php?title=)(.*?)(The-

);
document.body.innerHTML = html;  
 . Could somebody maybe please try to explain how that regex works, and what would work for (The-Identifier-That-Denotes-End-Of-Text-Of-Interest) since I don't seem to see any punctuation or spaces after the creatures names? Thanks! (Please NO jQuery info... javascript is enough to wrap my brain around right now LOL)

@LINK:/questions/14578711/contour-comparison-in-opencv-convertion-from-c-to-c
@TITLE:Contour comparison in OpenCV (Convertion from C to C++)
@CONTENT:I am still new in C++ and now I need to convert some parts from this old program of mine from C to C++ because I want to apply BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 in my program since it only available in C++. Basically this program will detect contours from a video camera based on background subtraction and choose the largest contours available. I have a problem particularly on this part (taken from the old program): double largestArea = 0;                    //Const. for the largest area
CvSeq* largest_contour = NULL;             //Contour for the largest area
while (current_contour != NULL){           //If the current contour available
    double area = fabs(cvContourArea(current_contour,CV_WHOLE_SEQ, false));   //Get the current contour's area as "area"    
    if(area > largestArea){            //If "area" is larger than the previous largest area
        largestArea = area;
        largest_contour = current_contour; 
    }
    current_contour = current_contour->h_next;  //Search for the next contour
}
 This part is where the program will scan each contour available as current_contour, find its area and compare it to previous largest contour. My question is how to get the current_contour, its area and jump to the next contour in C++? Also, what is indicated by contours.size() in C++? Is it the number of contours scanned or the total area of the contours? This is what I've done so far: for(;;)
{
    cap >> frame; // get a new frame from camera
    if( frame.empty() )
            break;
    image=frame.clone();
    mog(frame,foreground,-1);

    threshold(foreground,foreground,lowerC,upperC,THRESH_BINARY);
    medianBlur(foreground,foreground,9);
    erode(foreground,foreground,Mat());
    dilate(foreground,foreground,Mat());

    findContours(foreground,contours,CV_RETR_LIST,CV_CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE);  

    if(contours.empty())
        continue;

//Starting this part
    double largest_area = 0;
    for(int i= 0; i < contours.size(); i++){
        double area = contourArea(contours);
        if(area >= largest_area){
            largest_area = area;
            largest_contours = contours;
        }
    }
//Until this part

    drawContours(image,largest_contours,-1,Scalar(0,0,255),2);

    imshow( "Capture",image );
    imshow("Contours",foreground);

    if(waitKey(30) >= 0) break;

 Thanks in advance. PS: The old program got some bugs in it but the algorithm works just fine. Free to as me if you need the updated program. Currently using OpenCV 2.4.3 + VS C++ 2010 Exp. EDIT: Thanks to everybody who're trying to help me but I already got the answer which is from here. Still, for those how still don't know: OpenCV in C IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS OpenCV in C++.

            })
    })
    .ToList();
 Currently the field ContinuumCategory.ContinuumSubCategories is of type List so this query gives me a compile time error that it cannot convert IEnumerable to list, ofcourse it cannot. And as linq does not recognize ToList method so I cannot even use that inside my query. I can solve my problem by changing the type of ContinuumCategory.ContinuumSubCategories to IEnumerable but I have already used this field in many places where it uses List.Add method so I will have to replace all the Add methods to IEnumerable.Concat, so this can be tedious. Is there any workaround to directly get the list of continuum sub categories from linq query only? Edit: when I use this query(used ToList() method inside query for ContinuumSubCategories) studentCont.ContinuumCategories = db.continuumcategorymasters
    .Where(x => x.AssessmentId == assessmentId && x.ContinuumCategory != "other")
    .Select(x => new ContinuumCategory()

@TITLE:Printing multiple document in c# window application
@CONTENT:In c# window application I having a trouble with printing documents, when its become more than 1 page. See the following code which I am using for printing document and its working fine, while there is a small document i.e only one page. On print button's click event     private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        PrintDialog pd = new PrintDialog();
        PrintDocument doc = new PrintDocument();
        pd.Document = doc;
        doc.PrintPage += new PrintPageEventHandler(doc_PrintPage);
        DialogResult res = pd.ShowDialog();
        if (res == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
        {
            doc.Print();
        }
    }
 And PrintPageEventHandler is as following.     void doc_PrintPage(object sender, PrintPageEventArgs e)
    {
    //Fetching data from DB

        BillingApplicationEntities ent = new BillingApplicationEntities();
        List<tbCustBill> BillData = ent.tbCustBills.Where(s => s.BillId == 20133).ToList();

   //Printing doc

        Graphics grp = e.Graphics;

        Font fnt = new Font("Courier New", 12);
        float fontH = fnt.GetHeight();

        int startX = 10;
        int StartY = 10;
        int offset = 40;
        foreach (tbCustWorkDet d in WorkData)
        {
            string Pare = d.WorkName.PadRight(30);
            string pp = string.Format("{0:c}", d.Price).PadRight(30);

            string pl = Pare + pp;

            grp.DrawString(pl, fnt, new SolidBrush(Color.Black), startX, StartY + offset);

            offset += (int)fontH + 5;
           if (offsetY >= pageHeight)
           {
                e.HasMorePages = true;
                offsetY = 0;
                return; // you need to return, then it will go into this function again
           }
           else {
                 e.HasMorePages = false;
            }
        }
        offset += 20;
        // And cont with other data to print
    }
 This method is working fine and gives me my required o/p, but when data becomes more larger and its need more pages to print then in o/p it gives me only one page. As I think for multiple pages we have to set following property to true     e.HasMorePages = true;
 But I don't know where and how to put this value... In short I want to know how can I print multiple documents from above code? In this code return will return to the function and entire execution start again, and so on this will become in Infinite loop. Please tell me how can I prevent with this problem.
@CODE:private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        PrintDialog pd = new PrintDialog();
        PrintDocument doc = new PrintDocument();
        pd.Document = doc;
        doc.PrintPage += new PrintPageEventHandler(doc_PrintPage);
        DialogResult res = pd.ShowDialog();

@CONTENT:We are using Mongo DB for our Java Java EE based application. We are using one primary and two secondary as part of cluster of Mongo DB The Mongo DB is continuously read / Updated / Write as part of our architecture. Due to this we are getting Dirty Reads ( zero values ) When we do a fetch operation from Mongo DB. TO solve this, I am trying to configure it in such a way that the read operation always fetches from primary itself and writes / updates can go to primary / secondary. Please let me know if this is possible (always read from primary and use any thing primary/secondary for write/update) And will it have any negative impact with such a design?

 I want to record some strings and navigate in them. For example, an array my_array was created when the program starts. If the user pressed ctrl+c, then the selected text (let's say it's string a) was copied into clipboard and also it was appended to my_array. If the user pressed another ctrl+c, then b was copied into clipboard and also it was appended to my_array. See (1), now a, b, c, d was appended to my_array and d is in clipboard. Now if the user press alt+left_arrow, then c was copied to clipboard, see (2). Now if the user pressed alt+left_arrow 2 times, a is in clipboard, see (3). The user can press alt+right_arrow 3 times to get back d in its clipboard, see (4). At this time, the user can still press ctrl+c to appended data to my_array and press alt+left_arrow or alt+right_arrow to move around in the array to get data back. Actually to me this is easy to implement in some other familiar languages, but I have difficult to implement it in AutoHotKey. Anyone can help? Thanks in advance.

 then I do this: $('#loginBtnHtml').click(function(){

 I added the following function in order to add new points to the chart  function addPoints(name,acc)
 {
   var series = chart.series[0];
   series.addPoint(acc, false, true);
   categories = chart.xAxis[0].categories;
   categories.push(name+count);
   count++;
   chart.xAxis[0].setCategories(categories, false);
   chart.redraw();
 }
 The problem is that everytime I add a new point, one column shifts out of the chart. I would like to keep all columns in the chart view, so when I add a new point the chart just zooms out. Check it on JSFiddle Thanks in Advance ....

Short examples would help, but I'm looking more for a general outline and the know if what I'm wanting to do is even possible: 1) Have a "main" div where you select the item and enter the quantity for the item and select all the modifiers (I can do all this with text and checkboxes). Then click an "Add" button and it adds a summary of the order (maybe the quantity and item price total) to another div that "queues" up off to the side. 2) After hitting "add" the "main" div will clear all the boxes and allow me to add another item. 3) Have the ability to click the "summary" in the small div and re-display the order item.

@TITLE:jQuery progressbar: progress based on user input where values get saved
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement a jQuery progressbar where the user determines the progress (by typing into a text form), but if the user were to leave the page and then come back to it, the progressbar wouldn't be back at 0 again; it would be wherever they left off from before. Trying to figure out how to save their progress.... <form method="post" action="">
  <input id="first-value" type="text" name="first" value="" /><br />
  <input type="text" name="second" value="" />         
</form> 
 <script>
 $(function() {
  $( "#progressbar" ).progressbar({
    value: 0  //set to zero for now, but want it to change permanently when user    
             // inputs data
      });
});
</script>
 <script>
   $('input').change(function(){
    var new_amount = 0
    $('input').each(function() {

      if($(this).val() == "50") {
             new_amount += 5;   //5 Percent
      }
      if($(this).val() == "100") {
             new_amount += 10;  //10 Percent
       }
     }
   );

$("#progressbar").progressbar('value',new_amount);

});
</script>
 I want to take the values the user inputs (i.e. say, 100, 30, 80, etc.), add them up, make that amount the progressbar value, but keep it at that value even if they were to close the browser and come back to that page again.

@TITLE:Reuse multiple shapes in single append
@CONTENT:If I have a bunch of flowchart nodes: var nodes = [
  {NodeType: "prep", x:50, y:50,  height:40, width: 160},
  {NodeType: "io",   x:50, y:125, height:40, width: 160}, 
  {NodeType: "io",   x:50, y:200, height:40, width: 160}
]
 And I want to represent them all as rectangles, it's quite easy to do this in a single append: svg.selectAll("rect")
    .data(nodes)
  .enter().append("rect")
    .attr("x", function(d) { return d.x; })
    .attr("width", function(d) { return d.width; })
    .attr("y", function(d) { return d.y; })
    .attr("height", function(d) { return d.height; })
    .attr("stroke", "black")
    .attr("fill", "none");
 But what if I want them to be different shapes based on their type (IO and Preparation in my example above)? I hacked up a way to do it with a dictionary of path functions instead of rectangles (full code at http://bl.ocks.org/4659227). Each path function accepts height and width. svg.selectAll("path")
  .data(nodes).enter().append("svg:path")
  .attr("d", function(d) { return flow_shapes[d.NodeType](d.height, d.width);})
  .attr("stroke", "black")
  .attr("fill", "none")
  .attr("transform", function(d) {
    return "translate(" + d.x + "," + d.y + ")"
  });
 But it seems like there must be a better standard way to do this. Any ideas? I'm also concerned about the performance of the above code on a large node list, though I haven't done any stress testing of it yet.
@CODE:var nodes = [
  {NodeType: "prep", x:50, y:50,  height:40, width: 160},
  {NodeType: "io",   x:50, y:125, height:40, width: 160}, 
  {NodeType: "io",   x:50, y:200, height:40, width: 160}
] svg.selectAll("rect")
    .data(nodes)
  .enter().append("rect")
    .attr("x", function(d) { return d.x; })
    .attr("width", function(d) { return d.width; })
    .attr("y", function(d) { return d.y; })
    .attr("height", function(d) { return d.height; })
    .attr("stroke", "black")
    .attr("fill", "none"); svg.selectAll("path")
  .data(nodes).enter().append("svg:path")
  .attr("d", function(d) { return flow_shapes[d.NodeType](d.height, d.width);})
  .attr("stroke", "black")
  .attr("fill", "none")
  .attr("transform", function(d) {
    return "translate(" + d.x + "," + d.y + ")"

@TITLE:Cannot launch default application in a Metro app
@CONTENT:Ok, so Windows 8 comes with a cool PDF and XLS reader app, called Reader. I have a help document that I want displayed when the user clicks the Help button inside my app. My app should launch the PDF document with whatever is the default viewer for that document type. But it won't. There are no errors, no exceptions and setting a breakpoint reveals no information. The code I have is: <Button x:Name="help" Style="{StaticResource HelpAppBarButtonStyle}" Tag="Help" Click="help_Click_1" />
 and:     private async void help_Click_1(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)

        try

            Windows.Storage.StorageFile file =

        catch (Exception exception)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine(exception.Message);
        }
    }
 Now, inside solution explorer, there are the usual files and folders. I also have an Assets folder inside the root directory, and the PDF document is located inside this root folder. I am not sure why this isn't working, but I believe that it may have something to do with how I am pointing to the file in the above code: await Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync(@"\Assets\User Guide.pdf"); How do you correctly display a document contained in the Assets folder with using the default application for that document type?

@TITLE:How to convert NSMutableArray to CLLocationCoordinate2D
@CONTENT:I have NSMutableArray:         userCoordinates = [[d objectForKey:@"geo"] objectForKey:@"coordinates"];

        NSLog(@"%@",userCoordinates);
 NSLog shows: (
    "19.365367",
    "-99.159887"
)
 Then I need to convert this array to CllocationCoordinate2D to use it for create annotation. Sorry my english. Thanks.
@CODE:userCoordinates = [[d objectForKey:@"geo"] objectForKey:@"coordinates"];

        NSLog(@"%@",userCoordinates); (
    "19.365367",

@TITLE:Multiple string connections in EF DbContext
@CONTENT:I¡¦m developing a MVC Website based in codeplex EFMVC solution, and I¡¦m using Entity Framework and Repository, Unit of Work and Command Patterns. My website needs to be a SaaS solution (software as a service) multiple database. In my legacy Asp.Net WebForms I have a XML file that holds all the different string connections and I¡¦m trying to use the same strategy. So in my LoginController I create a command that has company (to identify in which database will be connected) username and password. At Validate() method in Domain project, I¡¦m reading the XML to get the correct string connection based on company field. My problem is how can I set the DatabaseFactory or DbContext to use this selected connection string? It should be injected at the constructor? Any suggestion for doing this in the correct way, without ¡§breaks the rules¡¨? Note that I¡¦m using AutoFac for Dependency Injection. Thanks for your attention. Best Wishes, Luiz Fernando Vall Dionizio

@TITLE:Second ScrollView doesn't zoom or scroll
@CONTENT:I have two Scroll View's in a xib, and they both contain a very large image that should start with it completely scaled down to fit. The first ScrollView works perfectly, objects are all moving around correctly when you zoom or scroll, but the second ScrollView starts completely zoomed in, unable to zoom out. The ScrollView is now showing 25% of the image(completely zoomed in at 0,0) and also cannot be dragged to see the rest. If I pinch to zoom, the image moves diagonally up and left without zooming at all, I can now drag the image back to 0,0 and back down the the max point it scrolled diagonally. .h file UIScrollView *_scrollView;

@TITLE:PHP/Ajax Polling Progress
@CONTENT:I am attempting to implement a live polling of a php script loop with no luck thus far in my attempts. Here is what I have thus far: On form submit: $.ajax({
data: $(this).serialize(),
success: showResponse,
url: 'process.php',
type: 'post'
});

function showResponse(){
$.ajax({
type: "GET",
url: "progress.php",
cache: false,
success: function(data) {
var response = $.parseJSON(data);
if (response.processing === true) {
console.log("Current Item: " + response.currentItem +
"Total Items: " + response.totalItems +
 "Percent Complete: " + response.percentComplete);
setTimeout(checkProgress, 1000);
});
}
 In the process.php script: session_start();
echo json_encode(array("processing" => true));
$totalItems = 10000000;
$_SESSION['totalItems'] = $totalItems;
$_SESSION['processing'] = true;
$_SESSION['error'] = false;
for ($i=0; $i <= $totalItems; $i++) {
$_SESSION['currentItem'] = $i;
$_SESSION['percentComplete'] = round(($i / $totalItems * 100));
}
 In the progress php script: session_start();
echo json_encode(array(
"processing" => $_SESSION['processing'],
"error" => $_SESSION['error'],
"currentItem" => $_SESSION['currentItem'],
"totalItems" => $_SESSION['totalItems'],
"percentComplete" => $_SESSION['percentComplete']
)
);
 Not sure where I am going wrong here but all it does is loop once it hits 100% complete. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! EDIT I changed the above to using apc in the process.php: apc_store('totalItems', $totalItems);
apc_store('processing', true);
apc_store('error', false);
apc_store('currentItem', $i);
apc_store('percentComplete', round(($i / $totalItems * 100)));
 And within the progress.php: echo json_encode(array(
"processing" => apc_fetch('processing'),
"error" => apc_fetch('error'),
"currentItem" => apc_fetch('currentItem'),
"totalItems" => apc_fetch('totalItems'),
"percentComplete" => apc_fetch('percentComplete')
    )
);
 Still doesn't work properly the way I am wanting it to work, am I doing something incorrectly? It only shows false values until the script completes and shows 100% just like the session use was doing before. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:I've been looking into using SignalR for a while now, and I think I have a good candidate for it. I have a page which allows users of the system to leave Comments, and at the moment it uses JQuery to periodically refresh the list of comments. I think SignalR would replace this nicely, i.e. if there were two users looking at the list and one wrote a comment, I would like it to appear instantly in the second. All well and good, I have a sort of template where this works. However My system itself can sometimes add automatic notifications to the list - These are put into the database directly by a non-web based application. How can I get SignalR to see the new information from the database and send it to the users?

This would make my code much cleaner. I can't use argparse unfortunately, as the platform I'm running on has an outdated Python version. Edit: To provide more detail, I'm adding an option with a callback and a default value parser.add_option(

 The callback function is defined as follows: def format_callback(option, opt, value, parser):
  # some processing
  parser.values.V = processed_value
 Basically I'm processing the "--format" value and putting the result into the parser. This works fine, when "--format" is specified directly via command-line, but I'd like the callback to be triggered on the default "a,b,c,d" value as well.

@TITLE:Generate 'random' numbers between x and y with a difference of at least 100
@CONTENT:I'm trying to position images within a banner div on a web page. The images need to be positioned 'randomly' along the x axis (using the CSS left property), so they don't always appear the same when the page is loaded. I have the following script to do this (it also sets a random delay so the images appear in a different temporal order each time: for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

    var delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 800) + 1;
    var xPos = Math.floor(Math.random() * 900) + 1;

    $('#item'+i).css('left',xPos+'px').delay(delay).animate({ top: 18 }, { duration: 1000, easing: 'easeOutBounce' });

}
 However, the problem is that there's very often too much overlap with the images and they're hidden behind one another. So I'd like to skew the randomness so that there's at least 100px difference between all of the xPos variables. This should give me a random-looking appearance but keeping the items mostly visible too. There must be a word to describe this kind of thing but having searched I just can't find anything useful to indicate how to achieve it. Can anyone point me in the right direction here? Many thanks. EDIT: Okay, so having a go at rolling my own functions to do this. I think I'm almost there. What I'm doing is creating an initial random number and adding this to an array, then looping through each of the 5 items and generating another random number, then comparing this to make sure it's more than 100 different to anything currently in the array. The code is like this (not all of my variables are being used currently - it's a work in progress!): function randomImagePlacement() {
    var containerWidth = 940;                   // Width of container element
    var itemWidth = 267;                        // Width of item (taking into account rotation)
    var minX = 0;                               // Minimum left position of an item
    var maxX = containerWidth - itemWidth;      // Maximum left position of an item
    var minSeparation = 100;                    // Minimum number of pixels of separation between items
    var numberOfItems = 5;                      // Total number of items
    var randomNumbers = [];                     // Array 'container' to hold random numbers

    for (var i = 1; i <= numberOfItems; i++) {

        if (i == 1) {
            var firstRandomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 700) + 1;
                    randomNumbers.push(firstRandomNumber);

 Basically where it's failing is in the do/while loop above. I'm not sure of the correct way to do something like this, but I basically need to say "Keep running the checkDiff function until it returns true; when it does return true add the newRandomNumber to the array; if it doesn't return true run it again". Can anyone help me out on this? Many thanks!

@TITLE:Want an efficient ASP.NET Web API controller that can reliably return 30 to 50 ~3MB JPEGs
@CONTENT:I'd like to change the following code into an efficient Web API controller method that can return 30 to 50 JPEGs (for <20 simultaneous users) of average 3MB size.     public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Get(int imageid) {
        return await Task.Run(() => {

                throw new HttpResponseException(new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.NotFound));
            }
            var response = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);

            var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            bitmap.Save(memoryStream, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
            response.Content = new ByteArrayContent(memoryStream.ToArray());
            var fileName = string.Format("{0}.jpg", dzImage.ImageName);
            response.Content.Headers.ContentDisposition = new ContentDispositionHeaderValue("attachment") { FileName = fileName };

            memoryStream.Flush();
            return response;
        });
    }
 The foregoing method handles one image. How can I best pluralize it to handle multiple images efficiently for this usage/load scenario? Is it possible to return Task<HttpResponseMessage>[] or Task<HttpResponseMessage[]>? Or would it be better generate all images and return them in one go? Thanks for your help...

@TITLE:Calling non-static methods from other classes
@CONTENT:I'm doing my assignment, and have run into some errors. In one class I have this method: public class Class1{
    public static boolean winningRecord(){
        final int WINNING_RECORD;
        return Class2.getPoints() > WINNING_RECORD;
    }
}

class Class2{
    int wins = 0;
    public int getPoints(){
        return wins; //More to it but to keep it simple I'll leave that out
    }
}
 Now I'm getting the error "Non-Static method cannot be referenced from a static context...", so I made getPoints() a static method, made the variables static as well, and it works. But in another method for printing out Objects it doesn't work (I believe it's because of the static keyword). So my question after all this is there a way to call a method without creating an instance of the second Class? This is the general idea code that I have, it should give you an understanding of what is going on, if not I'll add more to it.
@CODE:public class Class1{
    public static boolean winningRecord(){
        final int WINNING_RECORD;
        return Class2.getPoints() > WINNING_RECORD;
    }
}

class Class2{
    int wins = 0;
    public int getPoints(){
        return wins; //More to it but to keep it simple I'll leave that out
    }
} getPoints wins wins wins wins static getPoints() static

@LINK:/questions/14564896/weird-caching-issue-with-asp-net-linq
@TITLE:Weird caching issue with ASP.net/Linq
@CONTENT:I'm writing an application involving storing a profile. I'm using Linq to access the database, but having a weird issue when saving a profile. When I save it, it writes to the DB correctly - but when I leave the page and come back, the old values still remain in profile form. My profile page: if(!Page.IsPostBack) {
    Profile p = Student.GetProfile(Int32.Parse(Session["userID"].ToString()));
    if (p != null)
    {
          FirstNameTextBox.Text = p.FirstName;
          LastNameTextBox.Text = p.LastName;
          Address1TextBox.Text = p.Address1;
          .....
    }
 And my Student class:     public static Profile GetProfile(int uID)
    {
        var profile = (from p in db.Profiles
                       where p.uID == uID
                       select p).FirstOrDefault();
        return profile;
    }
 I'm not doing any fancy caching anywhere, so not sure where the old values are stored... ** EDIT ** So, it seems that it's down to a global LinqDataContext. In my Student class, I had: public class Student
{
    private static LinqClassesDataContext db = new LinqClassesDataContext() { CommandTimeout = 36000 };

    public static Profile GetProfile(int uID)
    {
            var profile = (from p in db.Profiles
                           where p.uID == uID
                           select p).FirstOrDefault();
            return profile;   
    }
 If I give the GetProfile method it's own DataContext, problem solved. Still being very new to Linq, what's the best way to have a class with numerous methods that use the same access to a database? Having a global context like this? Or each method using it's own data context?
@CODE:if(!Page.IsPostBack) {
    Profile p = Student.GetProfile(Int32.Parse(Session["userID"].ToString()));
    if (p != null)
    {
          FirstNameTextBox.Text = p.FirstName;
          LastNameTextBox.Text = p.LastName;
          Address1TextBox.Text = p.Address1;
          .....
    } public static Profile GetProfile(int uID)
    {
        var profile = (from p in db.Profiles
                       where p.uID == uID
                       select p).FirstOrDefault();
        return profile;
    } public class Student
{
    private static LinqClassesDataContext db = new LinqClassesDataContext() { CommandTimeout = 36000 };

    public static Profile GetProfile(int uID)
    {
            var profile = (from p in db.Profiles
                           where p.uID == uID
                           select p).FirstOrDefault();
            return profile;

@TITLE:Sending an Array of Strings over the Network
@CONTENT:I'm trying to retrieve usernames in a listview which is in string format. What I want to do is retrieve those usernames and store them in an array of strings and send them over the network, so that the receiving part can extract them and place those usernames in a listview. But the problem is, I'm having a bad time sending an array of strings over the network. I know how to send a string over the network but I don't know how to send and array of strings over the network. What I'm thinking is, maybe I should use a loop to store and extract the strings? But I don't know exactly how to do it. Here's my code for sending. 'Say, this array contains the following strings
Dim strData() As String = {"Dog", "Cat", "Mouse"}

If networkStream.CanWrite Then

       'This is not the proper way. What should I do here?
       Dim SentData As Byte()

       SentData = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(strData)

       NetworkStream.Write(SentData, 0, SentData.Length())

End If
 And here's my code for receiving. Dim rcvData() As String

If networkStream.CanWrite Then

       'Again, I don't think this is the proper way of handling an array of strings.
       Dim ByteData(ClientSocket.ReceiveBufferSize) As Byte

       NetworkStream.Read(ByteData, 0, CInt(ClientSocket.ReceiveBufferSize))

       rcvData = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(ByteData)

@LINK:/questions/14564714/arduino-code-anomalies-lcd-fails-with-multiple-if-statements
@TITLE:Arduino code anomalies - LCD fails with multiple 'if' statements
@CONTENT:I have a question about some code and weird anomalies. This code is placed on a Digispark. The Digispark has a code size limit of 6,010 bytes. When using nested if statements, text is not outputted to the LCD screen (see links below). By commenting out each set seperately I am able to get it working again. Basic LCD functions: LCD outputs internal beer temp and ambient air temp. http://imgur.com/S0rYvaa LCD clears LCD outputs target temp and heater (relay) status http://imgur.com/OtFXG1K Variables are of float type. float inside_temp;
float outside_temp;
float target = 74.00;

//inside_temp and outside_temp are values from 2 ds18b20's
inside_temp = 70.70;
outside_temp = 70.81;
 The LCD works when using this code with it commented out like this. The compiled size is 5,928 bytes. if(inside_temp < target){
    //Create a limit so heater isn't crazy hot as 5 gallons takes a while to change temperature.
    // float limit = target + 1;
    // if(outside_temp > limit){
    //     digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
    //     lcd.print("OFF");
    // }
    // else{
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
    lcd.print("ON");
    // }
  }
  else{
      digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
      lcd.print("OFF");
  }
 The LCD also works with this code. The compiled size is 5,590 bytes. // if(inside_temp < target){
    //Create a limit so the heater isn't crazy hot as 5 gallons takes a while to change temperature.
    float limit = target + 1;
    if(outside_temp > limit){
        digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
        lcd.print("OFF");
    }
    else{
       digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
       lcd.print("ON");
    }
    // }
    // else{
    //     digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
    //     lcd.print("OFF");
    // }
 LCD does NOT work when uncommented. The compiled size is 5,992 bytes. All it does is sit there with the backlit on and no text. http://imgur.com/xPAzY0N,DdGdYoI if(inside_temp < target){
    //create a limit so heater isn't crazy hot as 5 gallons takes a while to change temperature.
    float limit = target + 1;
    if(outside_temp > limit){
        digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
        lcd.print("OFF");
    }
    else{
        digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
        lcd.print("ON");
    }
}
else{
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
    lcd.print("OFF");
}
 I don't understand why this happens. Is this occuring because I'm getting too close to maximum size limit? Can I not structure code like this?
@CODE:if float inside_temp;
float outside_temp;
float target = 74.00;

//inside_temp and outside_temp are values from 2 ds18b20's
inside_temp = 70.70;
outside_temp = 70.81; if(inside_temp < target){
    //Create a limit so heater isn't crazy hot as 5 gallons takes a while to change temperature.
    // float limit = target + 1;
    // if(outside_temp > limit){
    //     digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
    //     lcd.print("OFF");
    // }
    // else{
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
    lcd.print("ON");
    // }
  }
  else{
      digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
      lcd.print("OFF");
  } // if(inside_temp < target){
    //Create a limit so the heater isn't crazy hot as 5 gallons takes a while to change temperature.
    float limit = target + 1;
    if(outside_temp > limit){
        digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
        lcd.print("OFF");
    }
    else{
       digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
       lcd.print("ON");
    }
    // }
    // else{
    //     digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
    //     lcd.print("OFF");
    // } if(inside_temp < target){
    //create a limit so heater isn't crazy hot as 5 gallons takes a while to change temperature.
    float limit = target + 1;
    if(outside_temp > limit){
        digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
        lcd.print("OFF");
    }
    else{
        digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
        lcd.print("ON");
    }
}

@CONTENT:Can the installutil be used to install a service written with a newer version of the .NET Framework? For example can the version from .NET Framework 2.0 be used to install a service written in .NET 4? I'm aware that technically the version from .NET 4 should technically be available on account of the fact the service will obviously require it. Additional information The reason for asking this is that a tool which we use to install services appears to be hard-coded with a path to the .NET Version 2.0 framework installutil. However the service I wanted to install was built with the .NET 4.0 Framework

    {

        {
            if (WaitPanelGrid.Visibility == System.Windows.Visibility.Visible)

            }
        }
        base.OnNavigatingFrom(e);
    }
 And everything is OK, except one thing: In this page i have transitions: <toolkit:TransitionService.NavigationInTransition>
    <toolkit:NavigationInTransition>
        <toolkit:NavigationInTransition.Backward>
            <toolkit:TurnstileTransition Mode="BackwardIn" />

@TITLE:VBScript to sort lines in a file
@CONTENT:I'm trying to sort lines in a file using VBScript (MS Internet Explorer). Basically I read the file and converted all the lines to an array. Basically I need to sort on whatever is written between character 23 and 27 of each line. So basically I can get those characters using MID. These characters are not unique per line (so I can't use System.Collections.Sortedlist directly, or something similar unfortunately). I may be able to use System.Collections.Sortedlist and use the characters between 23 and 27 as a key and use an other System.Collections.Sortedlist object as a value, filled with every unique value (so a 2-dimensional array), but will this be the right way? e.g.: (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
    "0001" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0001 some unique value1"
        1 => "0001 some unique value2"
        2 => "0001 some unique value3"
    },
    "0002" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0002 some unique value1"
        1 => "0002 some unique value2"
        2 => "0002 some unique value3"
    }
}
 Is there a better way to handle this? Also note the output format should be an array again.
@CODE:MID System.Collections.Sortedlist System.Collections.Sortedlist System.Collections.Sortedlist (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
    "0001" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0001 some unique value1"
        1 => "0001 some unique value2"
        2 => "0001 some unique value3"
    },
    "0002" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {

@CONTENT:I have a QListView and have assigned a model and a delegate. I am using it to display images in a horizontal bar as below On a user event, data is updated in the model. One such event causes the width of the images to be reduced like below(#4). I emit a dataChanged on the corresponding index and only the concerned widget is repainted. Because of this, there is a gap between #4 and #5 which does not get filled. I am thinking that there must be a way to refresh all visible rows - but am unable to find it. I tried the following, but they do not work: 1. viewport()->updateGeometries()

2. viewport()->update()

3. I tried changing the width to see if it refreshes

    this->mp_mylistview->setFixedWidth(curWidth + 1);

@TITLE:c# save a picture file to ram
@CONTENT:I am developing a program for image processing, and I need to save some pictures from a video and do some processing on them. When dealing with 1 picture it doesn't really take time, But when I'm dealing with 100 pictures it makes difference I'm saving the files to my hard disk, and that's why it takes time the thing is, the function I'm using is a ready made function and it only accepts (file name) the function is really complicated so i cannot build my own function ( if that's what you are thinking ) I'm thinking of 2 things right now and would like to have your opinions about them: change the input of the function, but how ? is there a way to change this input from a ( file name ) to an array which holds these pictures ? save the file to ram. but how to save files to ram by names, and be able to use them as ( file name ) in the function ? I appreciate your help , thanks so much this is my code but i still have problems:             Capture video = new Capture("c:\\5.avi");
            Image<Bgr, Byte> Imageframe ;

            Dictionary<string, MemoryStream> dict = new Dictionary<string, MemoryStream>();

                bmp.Save(dict["mypicture.png"],imageformat.png);    
 its saying imageformat does not exist in the context and this is the function im using : Image<Bgr, byte> result;

Conditions can be changed at any time and preferably from outside the code. People suggested i should be using expression parsers, but i still don't understand what advantage do they provide me over basic mathematical operations provided by .NET. Do you recommend a good .NET expression parser?

@TITLE:Google Maps Not Working in jQuery Tabs
@CONTENT:Google maps not working when placed inside jQuery tabs is a question that's all over the web. In my research so far none of the solutions seem to work. Hopefully someone here can help... This is a screenchot of the error in Firefox 10, Chrome 17, Safari 5.1.2, Opera 11.61. http://www.flickr.com/photos/75523633@N04/6932970713/ The error is not present in IE8 and is intermittant in 9. In Firefox, it goes away when you open FireBug. The site is in Wordpress 3.3.1 and the map is generated/retrieved via a plugin. It does not seem to matter which maps plugin I use; the error remains the same. Based on my research, this appears to be js/jQuery problem between the tabs and the Google Map API javascript, not a Wordpress/plugin problem. Here is my code. Right now, I'm using the wp-gmappity-easy-google-maps plugin for the maps, but I have also tried the comprehensive-google-map-plugin. Both work great outside the tabs. HTML: // Header calls:

 Here is a link to the file that governs my tabs: http://themes.mysitemyway.com/awake/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/tabs.min.js flowplayer.org/tools/forum/25/79274 is one solution I found (scroll to bottom). However, the checkResize and resizeMap no longer work (see api reference at code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#Map, scroll down a little to "Events" and find google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize') which is apparently the replacement code). www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/6/5/jQuery-Tabs-and-Google-Maps is another writeup that is too old. I've seen this proposed: jQuery(document).ready(function(){
jQuery('.tabs_container').bind('tabsshow', function(event, ui) {
    if (ui.panel.id == "map-tab") {
        google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');
    }
});
});
 but I have no idea how to implement it (tried a few ways with no success) or if it would even work. From all my research, it looks like you have to trigger a map resize event when the tab containing the map is selected. So far, I've had no luck adapting any of the solutions out there - espceially since I'm mot familiar with js/jQuery. It seems like someone familiar with js or jQuery could solve this. Please help me.

@CONTENT:Running OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard I cannot input the scandinavian letters into the interpretive mode. The terminal bell sounds for every keystroke and nothing shows up. All letters show up as normal in the regular terminal environment. Inputting UTF8 characters works fine in the Terminal, when running a python script, in PyDev and in IDLE Is there a problem with the interactive mode settings and these special characters? I have installed and am running python 2.7.3 mainly, but the OS-provided Pythons have this problem too. (i.e when running python2.5 or python2.6 I still experience this problem.) I dont know if installing python 2.7 has changed some under library that it uses, maybe readline (I'm on thin ice here, guessing basically)?

@TITLE:Animating a view created in IB using Autolayout
@CONTENT:I have a view with a lot of labels and buttons which are created on code because in IB is too complicated. This works ok. In IB I also created an input view which I want to appear from the bottom by the tap on a button. Very much like a keyboard if you will. Because this input view is strigth forward, it has been created on IB and it contains sliders, labels, etc. I haven't added it as a subview of self.view on IB. By the tap of the button, I set up all the constrains for the input view: I set the width, I set it on the bottom of the self.view with vertical size, then I remove this constraint, I add the actual heigth and then I animate with [self.view layoutIfNeeded]. The thing is that the input view itsef animates correctly, but its subviews not so much. They kind of appear at once. I have tried adding a input view programmatically, with only one switch. It animates quite nicely. I'm guessing that there is a problem with the constrains between the controls and their superView. But I'm not sure about it, because although they do not animate correctly, they are on the correct place and witht the correct proportions. I guess I'm missing something here. Maybe it's not a good idea to mix IB set controls and views and programmatically modifying them? Does somebody have any experience with that? Thanks in advance,

@TITLE:The file path to be opened is provided, how to get a handle to the new window?
@CONTENT:I want to implement a shell context menu "Open to Left/Right" that user can open a file with the new window being re-positioned to occupy the left/right half of the screen. Basically I just call Process.Start(fileName), and get the process's MainWindowHandle, and pass the handle to SetWindowPos to set the window's position. But some applications (like Word) are running as singleton instance, so Process.Start("new.docx") just pass the file name to the running instance, and returns null, so I can't get the window handle to do the repositioning. Is there a workaround for this? Any approach (preferred written in C#) is welcome. PS. I know I can just use EnumWindows to list all the top-level windows and let user to select which one he likes to reposition. But that is another use scenario. I want to implement the function in shell context menu.

@CONTENT:What is the most user-friendly way to deploy Windows 8 WinRT apps from within a WinRT app assuming they are already signed with a valid sideloading certificate? Windows Phone 8 has a nice API for installing XAP packages, but I can't find anything similar for Windows 8. The best thing I can think of is to download the various installation files to, for instance, My Documents and ask users to switch over to windows explorer and run the powershell scrpt, but that is very user un-friendly. Furthermore it looks like saving appx files is restricted in the manifest, so they would need to be zipped. Can appx files be deployed via msi? That would be slightly more user-friendly. Am I missing anything? EDIT This solution needs to work for x86 as well as ARM.

@TITLE:Can installutil be used to install a service written with a newer version of the .NET Framework
@CONTENT:Can the installutil be used to install a service written with a newer version of the .NET Framework? For example can the version from .NET Framework 2.0 be used to install a service written in .NET 4? I'm aware that technically the version from .NET 4 should technically be available on account of the fact the service will obviously require it. Additional information The reason for asking this is that a tool which we use to install services appears to be hard-coded with a path to the .NET Version 2.0 framework installutil. However the service I wanted to install was built with the .NET 4.0 Framework

@TITLE:stop wp7 out transitions while canceling navigation on OnNavigatingFrom
@CONTENT:In some case in my application, I have to cancel back navigation. I'm doing it with code:     protected override void OnNavigatingFrom(NavigatingCancelEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.NavigationMode == NavigationMode.Back)
        {
            if (WaitPanelGrid.Visibility == System.Windows.Visibility.Visible)
            {
                e.Cancel = true;
            }
        }
        base.OnNavigatingFrom(e);
    }
 And everything is OK, except one thing: In this page i have transitions: <toolkit:TransitionService.NavigationInTransition>
    <toolkit:NavigationInTransition>
        <toolkit:NavigationInTransition.Backward>
            <toolkit:TurnstileTransition Mode="BackwardIn" />
        </toolkit:NavigationInTransition.Backward>
        <toolkit:NavigationInTransition.Forward>

    </toolkit:NavigationOutTransition>
</toolkit:TransitionService.NavigationOutTransition>
 And calling Cancel in OnNavigatingFrom stop application from navigate back, but transition is still working, so in the end i have just black screen, because page was not changed, but it was animated and moved somewhere behind screen. My question is: How I can cancel navigating AND transition?
@CODE:protected override void OnNavigatingFrom(NavigatingCancelEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.NavigationMode == NavigationMode.Back)
        {

            {
                e.Cancel = true;
            }
        }

@CONTENT:Hello I am creating a Excel file with PHP. I am setting the header, before I print out some data: header('Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel; charset=utf-8');
 And then I am inserting something like: echo '<table><tr><td>t???st</td></tr></table>';
 My problem is that the ? isn't shown right in the excel file. I am also having an error, when I open the file that says: The file you are trying to open, 'filename.xls', is in a different format than specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before opening the file. Do you want to open the file now? Can you help me please? Thank you in advance.

But how to change it step by step, so it appears to fade in slowly. Here is example - Dynamic shadow As you can see if you scroll down with a tiny steps the shadow will appear slowly. I think they are changing opacity level. And I found that Google in account settings uses the same effect with changing opacity level.

@LINK:/questions/14563678/vbscript-to-sort-lines-in-a-file
@TITLE:VBScript to sort lines in a file
@CONTENT:I'm trying to sort lines in a file using VBScript (MS Internet Explorer). Basically I read the file and converted all the lines to an array. Basically I need to sort on whatever is written between character 23 and 27 of each line. So basically I can get those characters using MID. These characters are not unique per line (so I can't use System.Collections.Sortedlist directly, or something similar unfortunately). I may be able to use System.Collections.Sortedlist and use the characters between 23 and 27 as a key and use an other System.Collections.Sortedlist object as a value, filled with every unique value (so a 2-dimensional array), but will this be the right way? e.g.: (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
    "0001" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0001 some unique value1"
        1 => "0001 some unique value2"
        2 => "0001 some unique value3"
    },
    "0002" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0002 some unique value1"
        1 => "0002 some unique value2"
        2 => "0002 some unique value3"
    }
}
 Is there a better way to handle this? Also note the output format should be an array again.
@CODE:MID System.Collections.Sortedlist System.Collections.Sortedlist System.Collections.Sortedlist (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
    "0001" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0001 some unique value1"
        1 => "0001 some unique value2"
        2 => "0001 some unique value3"
    },
    "0002" => (System.Collections.Sortedlist) {
        0 => "0002 some unique value1"
        1 => "0002 some unique value2"
        2 => "0002 some unique value3"

@TITLE:How do I tell QListView to resize to fit?
@CONTENT:I have a QListView and have assigned a model and a delegate. I am using it to display images in a horizontal bar as below On a user event, data is updated in the model. One such event causes the width of the images to be reduced like below(#4). I emit a dataChanged on the corresponding index and only the concerned widget is repainted. Because of this, there is a gap between #4 and #5 which does not get filled. I am thinking that there must be a way to refresh all visible rows - but am unable to find it. I tried the following, but they do not work: 1. viewport()->updateGeometries()

2. viewport()->update()

3. I tried changing the width to see if it refreshes
    int curWidth = mp_mylistview->width();
    this->mp_mylistview->setFixedWidth(curWidth + 1);
    this->mp_mylistview->setFixedWidth(curWidth);
 Any suggestions? Note: The above images are samples for illustration and not the originals. If you need code, I will need to filter out confidential information before posting it.

@TITLE:Using an expression parser in .NET
@CONTENT:i am not sure if this is a typical stackoverflow question, but i am working on an application where i should constantly examine some conditions (for example if a certain variable's value is over a threshold). Conditions can be changed at any time and preferably from outside the code. People suggested i should be using expression parsers, but i still don't understand what advantage do they provide me over basic mathematical operations provided by .NET. Do you recommend a good .NET expression parser?

@TITLE:Google Maps Not Working in jQuery Tabs
@CONTENT:Google maps not working when placed inside jQuery tabs is a question that's all over the web. In my research so far none of the solutions seem to work. Hopefully someone here can help... This is a screenchot of the error in Firefox 10, Chrome 17, Safari 5.1.2, Opera 11.61. http://www.flickr.com/photos/75523633@N04/6932970713/ The error is not present in IE8 and is intermittant in 9. In Firefox, it goes away when you open FireBug. The site is in Wordpress 3.3.1 and the map is generated/retrieved via a plugin. It does not seem to matter which maps plugin I use; the error remains the same. Based on my research, this appears to be js/jQuery problem between the tabs and the Google Map API javascript, not a Wordpress/plugin problem. Here is my code. Right now, I'm using the wp-gmappity-easy-google-maps plugin for the maps, but I have also tried the comprehensive-google-map-plugin. Both work great outside the tabs. HTML: // Header calls:

 Here is a link to the file that governs my tabs: http://themes.mysitemyway.com/awake/wp-content/themes/awake/lib/scripts/tabs.min.js flowplayer.org/tools/forum/25/79274 is one solution I found (scroll to bottom). However, the checkResize and resizeMap no longer work (see api reference at code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#Map, scroll down a little to "Events" and find google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize') which is apparently the replacement code). www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/6/5/jQuery-Tabs-and-Google-Maps is another writeup that is too old. I've seen this proposed: jQuery(document).ready(function(){
jQuery('.tabs_container').bind('tabsshow', function(event, ui) {
    if (ui.panel.id == "map-tab") {
        google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');
    }
});
});
 but I have no idea how to implement it (tried a few ways with no success) or if it would even work. From all my research, it looks like you have to trigger a map resize event when the tab containing the map is selected. So far, I've had no luck adapting any of the solutions out there - espceially since I'm mot familiar with js/jQuery. It seems like someone familiar with js or jQuery could solve this. Please help me.

@TITLE:Animating a view created in IB using Autolayout
@CONTENT:I have a view with a lot of labels and buttons which are created on code because in IB is too complicated. This works ok. In IB I also created an input view which I want to appear from the bottom by the tap on a button. Very much like a keyboard if you will. Because this input view is strigth forward, it has been created on IB and it contains sliders, labels, etc. I haven't added it as a subview of self.view on IB. By the tap of the button, I set up all the constrains for the input view: I set the width, I set it on the bottom of the self.view with vertical size, then I remove this constraint, I add the actual heigth and then I animate with [self.view layoutIfNeeded]. The thing is that the input view itsef animates correctly, but its subviews not so much. They kind of appear at once. I have tried adding a input view programmatically, with only one switch. It animates quite nicely. I'm guessing that there is a problem with the constrains between the controls and their superView. But I'm not sure about it, because although they do not animate correctly, they are on the correct place and witht the correct proportions. I guess I'm missing something here. Maybe it's not a good idea to mix IB set controls and views and programmatically modifying them? Does somebody have any experience with that? Thanks in advance,

To make it work correctly i need to first disconnect the Resizer filter pins and then change the output settings and then reconnect it.(i do this manually and video is playing in Ntsc mode.) is it possible to reconnect the filter in Transform() or any other better suggestions.

@CONTENT:Hi I am trying to play video in PopupWindow but I am getting this error. I am able to play the same video directly in my activity. I found lot of queries related to Cannot Play video but none of them helped me in resolving this issue. Can any one help. Thanks In my activity.java file I am adding a popupWindow     private PopupVideoView mPopupVideoView;


    mPopupWindow = new PopupWindow(this);
    mPopupWindow.setContentView(mPopupVideoView.getView());
    mPopupWindow.setHeight(360);
    mPopupWindow.setWidth(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT);
    mPopupWindow.setOutsideTouchable(true);
    mPopupWindow.setFocusable(true);
 In PopupVideoView.java This gives me a view which contains a videoview and start playing the video as soon as i call getView().     public View getView() {

    if (mPopupVideoView == null) {
        mPopupVideoView = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.videoview_popup, null);
        mVideoView = (VideoView)mPopupVideoView.findViewById(R.id.popup_videoView);
    }

    String uri= "android.resource://" + mContext.getPackageName() + "/" + R.raw.video;
    mVideoView.setVideoPath(uri);
    mVideoView.start();

    mVideoView.setOnErrorListener(new OnErrorListener() {

        @Override
        public boolean onError(MediaPlayer mp, int what, int extra) {

            return true;
        }
    });

    return mPopupVideoView;

}
 in android 2.3.3 video is audible but not visible and in ICS its not even audible.

@TITLE:The file path to be opened is provided, how to get a handle to the new window?
@CONTENT:I want to implement a shell context menu "Open to Left/Right" that user can open a file with the new window being re-positioned to occupy the left/right half of the screen. Basically I just call Process.Start(fileName), and get the process's MainWindowHandle, and pass the handle to SetWindowPos to set the window's position. But some applications (like Word) are running as singleton instance, so Process.Start("new.docx") just pass the file name to the running instance, and returns null, so I can't get the window handle to do the repositioning. Is there a workaround for this? Any approach (preferred written in C#) is welcome. PS. I know I can just use EnumWindows to list all the top-level windows and let user to select which one he likes to reposition. But that is another use scenario. I want to implement the function in shell context menu.

@CONTENT:What is the most user-friendly way to deploy Windows 8 WinRT apps from within a WinRT app assuming they are already signed with a valid sideloading certificate? Windows Phone 8 has a nice API for installing XAP packages, but I can't find anything similar for Windows 8. The best thing I can think of is to download the various installation files to, for instance, My Documents and ask users to switch over to windows explorer and run the powershell scrpt, but that is very user un-friendly. Furthermore it looks like saving appx files is restricted in the manifest, so they would need to be zipped. Can appx files be deployed via msi? That would be slightly more user-friendly. Am I missing anything? EDIT This solution needs to work for x86 as well as ARM.

@TITLE:MongoDB GROUP function (or Map Reduce if necessary) with PHP- Distinct keys
@CONTENT:Does anyone have a good way to run a group function in PHP with a DISTINCT count. The situation is this: want to check unique logins to our app. This is how the document in the current collection I'm querying looks: Array
(
    [_id] => MongoId Object
        (
            [$id] => 50f6da87686ba9f449000003

    [userId] => 50f6bd0f686ba91a4000000f
    [action] => login
    [time] => 1358355079
 What I would like to do is count the UNIQUE userIDs through a group statement by date. This is the group statement that I am using (in PHP): $map= new MongoCode('function(frequency) {
                             var date = new Date(Number(frequency.time) * 1000 - (8 * 3600000));
                             var dd = date.getDate();
                             var yyyy = date.getFullYear();
                             var mm = date.getMonth() + 1;
                             if(dd<10){dd="0"+dd}
                             if(mm<10){mm="0"+mm}

                             return{"date": transday}
                    }');
$initial = array('logins' => array());
$reduce = "function(obj, prev){
                prev.logins.push(obj.userId);
                     }";


try{
  $distinct = array();
  $g = $this->_bingomongo->selectCollection("UserLog")->group($map, $initial, $reduce);
 From this point I am simply doing an array_unique in memory...but what I'd really like to do (and can't find a good answer on the net) is run a distinct count in the group by. I have seen a couple of other examples where we can use an array(distinct=>'key') but I am looking to do a count. Any thoughts? Thanks for any help!! Here's the rest of the code in it's current (imperfect) format:     foreach($g['retval'] as $k=>$v) {
          $distinct[date('m.d', strtotime($v['date']))] = array_unique($v['logins']);
      }
    }
    catch(Exception $e) {
       return $e;
    } return $g;
 Happy to do this in map/reduce if strictly necessary- but would rather find a way to keep it in group by (as a COUNT(distinct)). Thanks again for the help!

@TITLE:how to load the latest javascript files every time the user visits the website [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: How do I force the refresh of javascript files in a browser? My application in ASP.NET MVC based and javascript files are included in .csHtml file. I require this so that the user do not have to do a [Ctrl+F5] or manually clear cache and the most recent version of javascript file is loaded everytime in the browser. I appreciate if some examples can be provided. Primary technique suggested is to use a dummy paramater while including the file. Also I do not what to change the parameter manually every time I modify a js file. Need some examples if this can be done automatically. EDIT 1: Please provide solution to this with ASP.NET MVC prospective.

@TITLE:Selecting for special characters with rewriterule in htaccess file
@CONTENT:I made a little mistake (I started a new php call within an existing php call - oops) and managed to have google start crawling a whole bunch of urls that look like this: http://www.mydomain.com/folder/parameter/%3C/?php%20echo%20writelink();%20?%3E I've fixed the sourcing call, but my attempts to have .htaccess rewite the page calls to http://www.mydomain.com/folder/parameter/ have been unsuccessful. I have tried the following: RewriteRule  ^folder/(.*)/(.*)%(.*) /folder/$1/ [NE,R=301,L]
RewriteRule  ^folder/(.*)/(.*)3C/?php /folder/$1/ [R=301,L]
RewriteRule  ^folder/(.*)/(.*)writelink /folder/$1/ [R=301,L]
RewriteRule  ^folder/(.*)/([^/.]+)writelink /folder/$1/ [R=301,L]
 But all of them are returning the same 403. I have the test rewriterule as the first rewriterule in the file, so it isnt being usurped by something else. (For reference, the correct rewriterule when I havent mucked up the page is RewriteRule ^folder/(.*)/$ /content/element.php?param=$1 [L] ) I've had problems with %ages in the path before but this time I've decided to defeat it - any suggestions?

ps.setLayout(null);
ps.setSize(1000,600);

scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
scrollPane.setBounds(10, 119, 975, 300);
        scrollPane.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(JScrollPane.HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS);
ps.add(scrollPane);

table = new JTable(data, columns);
table.setAutoResizeMode(JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_OFF);
scrollPane.setViewportView(table);
 It is supposed t create a scrollPane with horizontal scrollbars, and when the number of columns increases in such a way that, it cannot be handled on a single screen, the scrollbar helps to display the contents. See "AUTO_RESIZE_OFF". But what happens is that, the the size of all the columns is fixed (I don't know how many characters. The width of all of them is same.). The name of the columns is thus not fully viewable. My question is, is it possible to increase the width of the column shown, or to show all the columns with their own width ? Also, how to enable scrolling ?
@CODE:ps = new JPanel();
ps.setLayout(null);
ps.setSize(1000,600);

scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
scrollPane.setBounds(10, 119, 975, 300);
        scrollPane.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(JScrollPane.HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS);
ps.add(scrollPane);

table = new JTable(data, columns);
table.setAutoResizeMode(JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_OFF);
scrollPane.setViewportView(table);

@LINK:/questions/14543119/how-do-i-correctly-deserialize-net-dictionaries-using-jackson
@TITLE:How do I correctly deserialize .NET Dictionaries using Jackson?
@CONTENT:to sum it up before the wall of text below :-) I need help with how to deserialize a Dictionary using Jackson and a custom deserializer. Right now I have an Android app communication with a .NET (C#) server. They use JSON to communicate. On the JAVA-side, I am using Jackson to handle the JSON and on the .NET-side I am using the built in DataContractSerializer (I know, ppl will start commenting I should use something else, but Im not so... ;-) ) The problem is that I am sending Dictionaries from C# and I want that to be deserialized to HashMaps om the JAVA-side, but I havent found a good resource for how to do that. One example of a Dictionary I am sending from C#: // Here, the object Equipment is the key, and the int following indicates the amount
[DataMember]
public Dictionary<Equipment, int> EquipmentList { get; set; }
 And just for reference, the Equipment object in C#: [DataContract]
public class Equipment
{
    [DataMember]
    public uint Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        if (obj.GetType() != this.GetType())
            return false;
        Equipment e = (Equipment)obj;
        return e.Id == this.Id;
    }
}
 Its serialized correctly into decent JSON on the C#-side, the Dictionary looks like this: //....
"EquipmentList":[
   {
      "Key":{
         "EquipmentId":123,
         "Name":"MyName"
       },
       "Value":1
   }
//....
 I have added a custom serializer (CustomMapSerializer), like this: public static ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
private static SimpleDeserializers simpleDeserializers = new SimpleDeserializers();
private static StdDeserializerProvider sp = new StdDeserializerProvider();

public static void InitSerialization()
{
    simpleDeserializers.addDeserializer(String.class, new CustomStringDeserializer());
    simpleDeserializers.addDeserializer(Map.class, new CustomMapDeserializer());
    sp.withAdditionalDeserializers(simpleDeserializers);
    mapper.setDeserializerProvider(sp);
}
 And decorated the field like this: @JsonDeserialize(using=CustomMapDeserializer.class)
public Map<Equipment, Integer> EquipmentList;
 And finally, when I run it I do get a break in the custom deserializer class, but I am not sure how to proceed from here: public class CustomMapDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer<Map> {

    @Override
    public Map deserialize(JsonParser arg0, DeserializationContext arg1) throws IOException, JsonProcessingException 
    {
        return new HashMap<Object, Object>(); // <-- I can break here
    }   
}
 So, what I would like is some input on how to create a HashMap with the correct values in it, ie a deserialized Equipment as Key and an Int as value. Anyone out there who can assist? =)
@CODE:// Here, the object Equipment is the key, and the int following indicates the amount
[DataMember]
public Dictionary<Equipment, int> EquipmentList { get; set; } [DataContract]

    [DataMember]
    public uint Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        if (obj.GetType() != this.GetType())
            return false;
        Equipment e = (Equipment)obj;
        return e.Id == this.Id;
    }
} //....
"EquipmentList":[
   {
      "Key":{
         "EquipmentId":123,
         "Name":"MyName"
       },
       "Value":1
   }
//.... public static ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

@TITLE:Sound wave from TargetDataLine
@CONTENT:Currently I am trying to record a sound wave from a mic and display amplitude values in realtime in Java. I came across Targetdataline but I am having a bit of trouble understanding I get data from it. Sample code from Oracle states: line = (TargetDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
line.open(format, line.getBufferSize());
ByteArrayOutputStream out  = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
int numBytesRead;
byte[] data = new byte[line.getBufferSize() / 5];

// Begin audio capture.
line.start();

// Here, stopped is a global boolean set by another thread.
while (!stopped) {
// Read the next chunk of data from the TargetDataLine.
numBytesRead =  line.read(data, 0, data.length);

****ADDED CODE HERE*****

// Save this chunk of data.
out.write(data, 0, numBytesRead);
}    
 So I am currently trying to add code to get a input stream of amplitude values however I get a ton of bytes when I print what the variable data is at the added code line. for (int j=0; j<data.length; j++) {
   System.out.format("%02X ", data[j]);

 Does anyone who has used TargetDataLine before know how I can make use of it?

@TITLE:Get clients on the network discover the server
@CONTENT:I'm currently writing a Java application that uses TCP/IP to communicate. What i'm trying to accomplish is to get the client to easy find the server and connect by sending some message out. The question now is: What can i do to make the client discover the server? Is there a way i can send a message to the router (DHCP-server maybe) that tells it that I'm using this service? Then the client could check if there is anything like that on the router (DHCP-server) and connect to the appropriate IP. Hopefully someone can help.

@TITLE:Cast Class Exception in Scala: java.lang.Object to Scala CaseClass
@CONTENT:This is driving me crazy - I'm working on play with scala, social secure etc and I keep getting this error when I'm trying to make a case class. Edit: similar question to this: Scala and Play2: ClassCastException: java.lang.Object cannot be cast to play.api.libs.json.JsValue Edit: moving the method createIdentityFromUser to the static companion class seems to fix this. Not sure why. [ClassCastException: java.lang.Object cannot be cast to securesocial.core.SocialUser]

56    println("here2")
57    //val ret = user.map(_.createIdentityFromUser)
58    user.foreach(x => x.createIdentityFromUser)
59    user match{
60      case Some(x) => Some(x.createIdentityFromUser)
61      case None => None
 Line42 errors out. The map, foreach, and match all bomb with that classcastexception and I don't understand why. Here is the code cleaned up a bit for readability (note SocialUser extends Identity trait):   def find(id: UserId): Option[Identity] = {
   if ( Logger.isDebugEnabled ) {
     Logger.debug("find users = %s".format(users))
   }

   //Option[GraphedUser]
   val user = GraphedUser.getUser(id.id)

   //ret should be Option[SocialUser]
   val ret = user.map(_.createIdentityFromUser) //errors!

   return ret

 }
 And the method that is called to produce the object which appears to be the problem. It's in a trait that extends tinkerpop frames VertexFrame interface. I'm guessing that has something to do with it.   def createIdentityFromUser: SocialUser = {

    return new SocialUser(new UserId(getUserId, getProviderId), getFirstName, getLastName, getName, Some(getEmail),
      None, new AuthenticationMethod("userPassword"), None, None, Some(new PasswordInfo(getPasswordInfoHash, getPasswordInfoSalt)))

@CONTENT:I need to write a simple VBScript to modify an existing XML file. I am able to write a VBScript to modify an element, but the problem I am currently encountering is that I have multiple elements with the same Element/tag names but different ATTRIBUTES as the below XML document sample shows: <MyDoc>

@TITLE:Why does throws me a FaultException in WCF Service?
@CONTENT:Let me clarify my scenario. I've got a WCF Service where uses a library, in this library exist the database model (edmx). In my WCF Service: [DataContract]
public class QuestionSetInformation
{
    [DataMember]
    public string Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public string SetName { get; set; }
    [DataMember]

    var query = from r in QuestionRepositoryManager.GetRepositories()
                select new QuestionSetInformation()
                {

                   ObjectiveName = r.ObjectiveName
                };

    return query.ToArray();
}
 As my library uses the EDMX, so I moved the connection strings to my WCF and it works PERFECTLY using the WCF Test Client. It delivers me what I'm expecting. <?xml version="1.0"?>

 FaultException`1 was unhandled Code generated using the T4 templates for Database First and Model First development may not work correctly if used in Code First mode. To continue using Database First or Model First ensure that the Entity Framework connection string is specified in the config file of executing application. To use these classes, that were generated from Database First or Model First, with Code First add any additional configuration using attributes or the DbModelBuilder API and then remove the code that throws this exception. I have investigated this error in the web, everyone tells about a problem using the connection string but I supposed it's not the same case. I don't have idea about how to fix it

@CONTENT:ISO 8601 3.5.2 distinguishes between date-time combined values and time-only values. Time-only values model the 24-hour clock of an indeterminate day not on the calendar. For Time-Only values, 24:00 is a valid value, to distinguish the end-of-the-day from the start-of-the-day (00:00). Until explicitly attached to a day on the calendar, Time-Only values are simply a point on the segment of finite time that runs from 00:00 to 24:00. What is the current ECMA standard with respect to Time-only values? EDIT: Is there a proposed standard that address this?

 The problem is that despite initializing "key" (the buttons) in my test bench, ModelSim still lists the object as "UUUU". Here is the code for my test bench, which is located in a separate file: library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

@TITLE:Three.js shadow map stripes in each light (now simplified, and with jsfiddle!)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create, modify and update (directional only for now) lights and shadowmaps dynamically. The light, shadow and shadow camera helper gets updated correctly as I move the light around or change shadow properties, except from the light's point of view, everything behind the origin (0,0,0) is shadowed for no apparent reason. Screenshots: http://i.imgur.com/n4AHvle.png http://i.imgur.com/l0uaZHD.jpg http://i.imgur.com/brKwCof.jpg http://i.imgur.com/a6dqMGo.jpg (new, with spotlight) You can see a scene with car and a piece of ground, they belong to a geometry imported with ColladaLoader. The problem is with shadowmapping, the car throws shadow correctly, but there are stripy shadows on the ground even though there is nothing else than the car obscuring light. If I add more similar lights, they also have the same 4 stripes. They also appear with spotlight. If I change shadow map resolution, the stripes' size changes relative to each other, but there seems to be always four of them, spaced from center to both directions. EDIT: JSFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/cL3hX/1/ There shouldn't be any shadows in the scene, unless some new geometry is introduced inside the shadow camera frustum. Couple of notes on the fiddle: I have r55, but the demo is r54 because jsfiddle apparently does not yet have r55. I could only reproduce this with a Collada file. So it probably has something to do with the model. I created a simple cube in Sketchup 8, and tried to export it with various collada options. In the JSFiddle I could only reproduce the bug with a file exported with "doublesided faces" -setting enabled. In my own application code, I do have the same bug on models created with or without that setting enabled, but in the fiddle, the bug seems to be triggered only when "doublesided faces" are exported. Anyway I do need to somehow show backsides of faces, because the tool I'm developing must work with Sketchup exports, and it's very hard to make models in Sketchup without having a mess of frontsides/backsides visible. The very simple Collada file is included in the JSFiddle as javascript variable. Here's a download link for the same file: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14489569/shadowmapdemo.dae

@TITLE:PHP how to check 2 statements to only send one message no duplicates between
@CONTENT:I have been trying to code a notification system for a profile wall script I made a long time ago for a forum. The trouble I have is, that I am trying to only send one PM to the people who fit the criteria for the PM, but I also have 2 select statements in MYSQL to find the people who should be PM'd. I have 2 tables to select from... log_statuses and log_status_replies I am trying to achieve this. I want it to notify everyone who has commented only ONCE! Also the persons wall it belongs to and the person who written the status on the persons wall, but not yourself if you written it. Kinda complex that's why I am struggling to get this right... Here is my code for it to search through who commented and send them a PM. How would I also do the checks for who written the status and who's wall it is, without it sending a duplicate PM if they have commented aswell. Otherwise they would receive a PM because they have commented and because its their status/wall. I hope you understand that, kinda hard to explain. Here is my source code..

@TITLE:Compute final score by sum of multiple fields weighted scores with eDisMax
@CONTENT:i want to compute a final score for each document by summing the weighted scores of multiple fields scores,instead of getting the MAX as the edisMAx query parser does. So if i got three fields;title and description, i want my final score to be like this: FINAL SCORE = w1 * title_field_score + (1-w1) * description_field_score + (1-w1 -w2) * description_field_score Where w1,w2 can be values between 0 to 1. The default similarity with no any simialrity gives this ranking. This uses the following search handler:   <requestHandler name="/select" class="solr.SearchHandler">
 <lst name="defaults">
   <str name="echoParams">explicit</str>
   <int name="rows">10</int>
   <str name="df">detail_page_text</str>

   <!-- Query settings -->
   <str name="defType">edismax</str>
   <str name="qf">
      job_title description detail_page_text
   </str>
 now by using the tie as below, seems that we getting a ideal ranking. <str name="tie">1.0</str>
 So my question is if the use of the tie parameter is the right way to achieve a weigthed ranking score based on all fields equaly(or with additional weights). Any tip would be much appreciated! Cheers

@LINK:/questions/14538786/php-download-pdf-always-results-in-not-supported-file-type-of-damaged-file
@TITLE:PHP Download PDF always results in not supported file type of damaged file
@CONTENT:I'm trying to allow the user of my site to download files. More than this, I'd like to bake this into a Front Controller framework that I've created/am using. I can get the download to occur but when trying to open the file Adobe Reader always gives an error saying the file is of an unsupported type or it is damaged. In My Downloads it says the size of the file is 0KB which is obviously wrong, so it is getting damaged I guess. I don't know why though. I CAN get the download to work but skipping my Front Controller framework and just having it directly run a download script. This script looks like this and is called downloadManager.php and is called from a link with href="/myApp/downloads/downloadManager.php: <?php
 header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");

$file = "eZACKe_1359081853_Week Three Sprints & Hurdles Workout 24th - 28th of Sept    (1).pdf";
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=" . $file);
header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Type: application/download");
 header("Content-Description: File Transfer");
header("Content-Length: " . filesize($file));
flush(); // this doesn't really matter.
$fp = fopen($file, "r");
while (!feof($fp)) {
    echo fread($fp, 65536);
    flush(); // this is essential for large downloads
}
fclose($fp);
?>
 This works, but I'd like to keep my framework working. This is the code flow using my framework, with link href being href="/myApp/downloadz?type='resume'&id='8'": The url gets rewritten by apache and goes to index.php which is my front controller: <?php
class Foo {
static public function test($classname)
{
    if(preg_match('/\\\\/', $classname))
    {
        $path = str_replace('\\', '/', $classname);
    }
    else
    {
        $path = str_replace('_', '/', $classname);
    }

    if (is_readable($path.".php"))
    {
        require_once $path .".php";
    }
}
}
spl_autoload_register('\Foo::test');

\controller\Controller::run();
?>
 Which leads to a Controller: static function run()
{
    $instance = new Controller();
    $instance->init();
    $instance->handleRequest();
}
 init sets up a PDO MySQL connection, and also loads some config files using Simple_XML_Load Then,     function handleRequest()
{
    $request = new \controller\Request();
    $cmd_r = new \commands\common\CommandResolver();
    $cmd = $cmd_r->getCommand($request);
    $presenter = $cmd->execute($request);

    if(!$request->getProperty('ajax') && !is_a($cmd, '\commands\Download\DownloadCommand')) {
        echo $this->handleRender($request, $presenter);
    }
}
 Only thing to note here is getCommand and checks if files exist and uses reflection So then $cmd->execute is called and at this point we call DownloadzCommand::execute,     function execute(\controller\Request $request) {

    parent::execute($request);

    if($this->request->getProperty("type") == "resume" || $this->request->getProperty("type") == "coverLetter") {
        $this->handleJobApplicationDownload();
    }
}

private function handleJobApplicationDownload() {
    if(!$this->loggedInMember) {
        exit;
    }

    try {
        $idobj = new \mapper\IdentityObject ();
        $jobApplication = \domain\JobApplication::produceOne($idobj->field("jobApplication.jobApplicationId")->eq($this->request->getProperty("id"))->field("jobApplication.jobId")->eq("jobs.jobId", false)->field("businesses.businessId")->eq("jobs.businessId", false)->field("jobApplication.dateApplicationViewed")->isnull("", false), null, "JobBusinessJoin");

        // get here the jobApplication is legit - now make sure the logged in member is a recruiter for this business
        $idobj = new \mapper\IdentityObject ();
        $business = \domain\Business::produceOne($idobj->field("businessId")->eq($jobApplication->getState("businessId")));

        if(!$business->isRecruiter($this->loggedInMember->getId())) {
            exit;
        } else {
            if($this->request->getProperty("type") == "resume") {
                if($path = $jobApplication->getState("resumeUploadPath")) {
                    // have a resume path, move it over
                    $fullPath = "common/jobs/resumes/".$path;

                    $tempDest = "commands/Downloadz/$path";
                    copy($fullPath, $tempDest);
                } else {
                    exit;
                }
            } elseif($this->request->getProperty("type") == "coverLetter") {
                if($path = $jobApplication->getState("coverLetterUploadPath")) {
                    // have a coverLetter path, move it over

            }
        }
    } catch(\base\ObjectDoesNotExistException $e) {
        echo "nope";
    }


    header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=" . $path);
    header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
    header("Content-Type: application/download");
    header("Content-Description: File Transfer");

    flush(); // this doesn't really matter.
    $fp = fopen($file, "r");
    while (!feof($fp)) {
        echo fread($fp, 65536);
        flush(); // this is essential for large downloads
    }
    fclose($fp);

    unlink($path);

}
 And at this point the download occurs. I open the file though, and it is damaged. A note, same thing happens even for a simple text file. Also, it also doesn't work even if I skip the file copying part and just have the file originally in commands/Downloadz directory. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How to operate a SwitchBoard that turns on the following switches within a sequence n? Python 3x
@CONTENT:I wand to build a class SwitchBoard with the following properties: when I create a switchboard, I should be able to set the number of switches it contains all switches should start in the "off" position if I print a switchboard, it should print something along the lines of: "The following switches are on: 1 3 5 7 9" if I call switch(n) with n as an integer, it should ip the status of the n'th lightswitch if I call switch every(n) with n as an integer, it should ip the status of every n'th lightswitch I should be able to write a piece of global code that solves the lightswitch problem as stated above. This is my work so far, the first is class LightSwitch If switch is ON, it will flip and turn it OFF If switch is OFF, it will flip and turn it ON class LightSwitch():

    def __init__(self, mode):
            self.switch = mode

    def __str__(self):
        if self.switch == True:
            return ("I am on")

        if self.switch == False:
            return ("I am off")        

    def turn_on(self):
        self.switch = True

    def turn_off(self):
        self.switch = False

    def flip(self):
        if self.switch == True:
            self.switch = False
        else:
            self.switch = True
 And for the class SwitchBoard, this is what I have: class SwitchBoard():

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.switches = []
        for i in range(n):
            self.switches.append(LightSwitch(False))

    def switch(self, n):
        self.switches[n].flip()

    def switch_every(self, n):
        for i in range(0,len(self.switches), n):
            switch(i)

    def __str__(self):
        return "The following switches are on: " + str(self.switches)


if __name__ == ('__main__'):

    my_light = LightSwitch(False)
    my_light.flip()
    print (my_light) # This prints "I am on"

    my_light2 = LightSwitch(True)

 This isn't working out, I'm using a list to append the number of OFF switches but I'm not sure how to write global code to solve this issue, such as turning on switches within a sequence, or maybe something is missing, please help.
@CODE:LightSwitch class LightSwitch():

    def __init__(self, mode):
            self.switch = mode

    def __str__(self):
        if self.switch == True:

            return ("I am off")        

    def turn_on(self):
        self.switch = True

    def turn_off(self):
        self.switch = False

    def flip(self):
        if self.switch == True:
            self.switch = False
        else:
            self.switch = True SwitchBoard class SwitchBoard():

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.switches = []
        for i in range(n):
            self.switches.append(LightSwitch(False))

    def switch(self, n):
        self.switches[n].flip()

    def switch_every(self, n):
        for i in range(0,len(self.switches), n):
            switch(i)

    def __str__(self):
        return "The following switches are on: " + str(self.switches)


if __name__ == ('__main__'):

    my_light = LightSwitch(False)
    my_light.flip()
    print (my_light) # This prints "I am on"

    my_light2 = LightSwitch(True)
    my_light2.flip()

 The page behaves different why? I know that jsFiddler can simulate an ajax call using the url 'echo' but I simulated an error on purpose hoping I could get the same results on my website. Edit I changed the image source for: http://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/sleekxp/Google%20Chrome.png I updated jsFiddler the new link is: http://jsfiddle.net/jhruh/3/ and I canot make it work still.

    View root = super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);

 The getMap() gives an error, as it says method getMap() is undefined for the type MapFragment. What does this mean?

@TITLE:How to localize a generic error messages partial in Rails 3.2.3?
@CONTENT:I am using the following partial to display error messages for most of my models in Rails 3.2.3: # _error_messages.html.erb

<% if object.errors.any? %>
<div id="error_explanation">
    <h3><%= pluralize(object.errors.count, "error") %>
    prohibited this <%= object.class.to_s.underscore.humanize.downcase %> from being saved:</h3>        
    <p>There were problems with the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
        <% object.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
            <li><%= msg %></li>
        <% end %>
    </ul>
</div>
<% end %>
 This worked great until I decided to localize my application using I18n. I created a new file de.yml for the German language content which contains this (among many other things): # de.yml

errors: &errors
  format: ! '%{attribute} %{message}'
  messages:
    blank: muss ausgef?llt werden
  template:
    body: ! 'Bitte ?berpr?fen Sie die folgenden Felder:'
    header:
      one: ! 'Konnte %{model} nicht speichern: ein Fehler.'
      other: ! 'Konnte %{model} nicht speichern: %{count} Fehler.'

etc. etc. etc.
 Now how can I use this content in my error messages? Especially the line <%= object.class.to_s.underscore.humanize.downcase %> puzzles me. I tried something like <%= t 'activerecord.errors.template.header', :model => object.model_name.human %> but without any luck. Can anybody help? I read the Rails guide on localization three times already, but I am stuck here. Thanks for any help!

OK, this may sound confusing too. Let's take a terminal app which simply outputs a progress percentage. It normally won't start a new line for that. The new value is shown at the very same spot. How is this doable? (Being a once Borland Pascal guy from the good old DOS days, the only thing I could think of is something to do with accessing video memory directly... or not?) So... any ideas?

@CONTENT:I have 2 web applications A and B (for those familiar with Zoho, A is Zoho Creator and B is Zoho Invoice) From web application A, I need to open a page within Application B and get to a particular view in B which can only be obtained by clicking a link on the page in B (as that view is obtained by an AJAX load of the view). Limitation of B is that it does not expose the particular view I want by means of a URL with paramaeters (i.e. I can't get what I want just by having a new browser window request www.appB.com/somePage?ID=1233. I can only have the new browser window request www.appB.com/somePage and then I need to manually click an AJAX link in B that opens up a view I want). Limitation of A is that I do not have access to javascript. I have limited means (Zoho Creator's Deluge language) to open another web application in a new browser window. All I can do is give the webpage of A a URL and tell it open it in the same window or a new window. So only manipulative capability I have on webpage of A when opening a new browser window is the new webpage's URL. What I want to accomplish is - From webpage of A just via URL open new browser window that loads the initial page of B and then my javascript executes and clicks on the link on B that loads the desired AJAX view in the B's browser window. Any thoughts on how to get this to work? Your inputs are much appreciated and thanks a lot in advance.

@TITLE:Validating Input::json() in Laravel
@CONTENT:Validation does not work with Input::json. Ive tried different ways using json_decode/using arrays but still no luck. Here's my code: //routes.php
Route::get('create', function() {

    $rules = array(
        'username' => 'required',
        'password' => 'required',
    );

    $input = Input::json();
    //var_dump($input); //outputs std obj with correct inputs
    $validation = Validator::make($input, $rules);
    if ($validation->fails()) { //throws exeption "Call to a member function to_array() on a non-object"
        return Response::json($validation->errors->all());
    }

}
 I'm posting the data using Angular Resource...but it always throws an error "Call to a member function to_array() on a non-object"...I cant paste my angular code since I can't format it correctly and stackoverflow doesn't allow me to do that.
@CODE://routes.php
Route::get('create', function() {

    $rules = array(

@TITLE:PHP mySQL Password issue with extra characters
@CONTENT:I'm very new to php and mysql. I have found a great tutorial to create a registration and log in section on a site. I'm managing to deconstruct it pretty well and make minor changes. However... When logging in, if the password is incorrect it validates and an error is returned. If its correct it logs in. The issue I have is that if you type the correct password but add extra characters after it neither validates or logs in. Just goes to a blank page. Here is the validation code for the login page - <?php
include('db.php'); 
if(!isset($_POST['login']))//checking if user has entered this page directly
{
include('form.php');
}
else{
if(isset($_POST['user'])&&$_POST['user']==""||!isset($_POST['user']))
{
$error[] = "Username Field can't be left blank";
$usererror = "1";
}
if(!isset($usererror))
{
$user = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['user']);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = '$user'";
if(mysql_num_rows(mysql_query($sql))=="0")//1 means there is one entry same so we print error
{
$error[] = "Can't find a user with this username"; 
}
}
if(isset($_POST['pass'])&&$_POST['pass']==""||!isset($_POST['pass']))
{
$error[] = "password Field can't be left blank";
}
if(isset($error)){
if(is_array($error)){echo "<div class=\"error\"><span>please check the errors and refill the form<span><br/>";
foreach ($error as $ers) {     
echo "<span>".$ers."</span><br/>";
}
echo "</div>";
include('form.php');
}
}
if(!isset($error)){
$suser=mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['user']);
$spass=md5($_POST['pass']);//for secure passwords
$find = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = '$suser' AND password = '$spass'";
if(mysql_num_rows(mysql_query($find))=="1"or die(mysql_error())){
session_start();
$_SESSION['username'] = $suser;
header("Location: loggedin.php");
}
else{
echo "<div class=\"warning\"><span>Some Error occured durring processing your data</div>";
}
}
}
?>
 Any help will be greatly appreciated... EDIT I've just noticed that the only error I get is if NO password is entered. If an incorrect password is entered I get the blank white page. Can anyone help as to why the password is not being verified?

@TITLE:IE7 Subnav, two positioning issues
@CONTENT:Site in question: http://khill.mhostiuckproductions.com/siteLSSBoilerPlate/ If you test the above link in IE7 (I am using IE9 with browsermode and browser compatability for IE7), there is a positioning problem with the subnavs. Hover over about us, then hover over home, and then go back to About us. You will see the sub-nav has moved to the right by the width of the LI above it. This is coded purely in CSS. This works perfectly in all browsers except for IE7, I would like to keep this working within CSS, without any Javascript fixes. I also have a z-index issue, any ideas on these two issues? Here is the CSS code that handles the main UL and LI, as well as the CSS that handles the first Subnav. (note the secondary subnav under "Michael" works as intended). ***Note that the class .main-nav is applied to the first UL that handles the horizontal bar. The class .main-sub-nav is applied to the UL that holds the subnav LI's Michael, Kenny etc. under the About us menu. nav .main-nav {

@CONTENT:I am working on Ubuntu. And need to copy perforce plugin file to jenkins/plugins directory. Since the directory is owned by jenkins user; I want to logon as jenkins user to do any work in this directory. How can I get jenkins user's passowrd? Am I going in the right direction? In general what is the preferred method of copying files to a directory in Ubuntu not owned by current user. The perforce plugin does not appear on the plugin manager page; hence going the download+copy route.

Was looking here and here for some clue but after 4 hours ready to give up on ever using Git. If you look at the first link I put in this quesion the answer with 4 upvotes, I was trying to do exactly what he said: "That way, you keep separate your initial source folder, from your Git working tree.", which is why I was trying to use --work-tree=yourSrcFolder add, So I hope that gives the downvoters some reasoning behind my motives.

@TITLE:Excel.Range.Copy() paste with Clipboard.GetText()
@CONTENT:I have this little piece of C# code in which I'm trying to loop through Worksheets inside an Excel file, copy the UsedRange to the Clipboard and paste it into a text file. The code I have so far appears to work without throwing any errors, but for some reason nothing at all gets written into my text file. Am I missing something? And if I include the System.Reflection.Missing.Value as a parameter for the Copy method, still nothing happens. Here's my code: using (StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText("ExtractedText.txt"))
{
     foreach (Excel.Worksheet sheet in thisWkBook.Worksheets)
     {
         sheet.UsedRange.Copy();
         sw.Write(Clipboard.GetText());
     }                    
}
 EDIT #1: I suspect that some kind of reference must've broke with my little app, since the piece of code suggested by Haxx works if I create a new C# project. But if I use the same code from Haxx and inserted in my little app as a new method, it just doesn't work, even though it's the exact same code with the exact same "using" libraries being called... I will just redo the whole app, copy/pasting the most important parts of code and report back if this fixes the problem. EDIT #2: I believe I figured what the problem is. I forgot to mention that I'm using a BackgroundWorker (System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker) so that I can show a Progress Bar when I run this little process. I just read that apparently you can only access the Clipboard from the STAThread (Clipboard.GetText returns null (empty string)). So I went ahead and created a separate method that doesn't make any use of BackgroundWorkers, thus it runs on the STAThread, and voila! The code is correct and functional but trying to access the Clipboard won't work if calling it async from a BackgroundWorker thread.
@CODE:System.Reflection.Missing.Value using (StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText("ExtractedText.txt"))
{
     foreach (Excel.Worksheet sheet in thisWkBook.Worksheets)
     {
         sheet.UsedRange.Copy();
         sw.Write(Clipboard.GetText());

@LINK:/questions/14528562/access-parent-class-member-with-javascript-inheritance
@TITLE:Access parent class member with javascript inheritance?
@CONTENT:I need to extend a base class with additional functionality in javascript. I'm using backbone.js inheritance as an example here, but it's a general question about extending classes. http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/#inheritance-mixins Parent = Backbone.View.extend({
    value: "Parent value",
    func: function(){
        alert('Parent function, ' + this.value);
    }
});

Child = Parent.extend({
    value: "Child value",
    func: function(){
        alert('Child function, ' + this.value);
    },
    test: function(){
        this.constructor.__super__.func.call(this);
        //Parent.prototype.func.call(this)
    }
});

var child = new Child();

child.test();

// prints: Parent function, Child value
// should print: Parent function, Parent value
 Here is a jsfiddle sandbox to ease experimentation. The problem is that extend() seems to work more like interface implementing instead of inheritance. So Child is really still Parent, but with extra member functions. The "value" member appears to be virtual, so there is only one instance of it, instead of one per descendent. In c++ I could say Parent::func() and inside, this->value would be "Parent value". I have tried the various ._super extensions to backbone.js but they all still suffer from "this" being the wrong context in Parent. I've also tried _.bindAll() in either/both Child/Parent but it fails for the same reason: initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, 'func');
}
 What's the cleanest way to have "this" be the proper context in the Parent in javascript, or at least simulate that functionality with a minimum of code? Do I need to create a "parent" member in Child and instantiate it to create "value" members for each descendent?
@CODE:Parent = Backbone.View.extend({
    value: "Parent value",
    func: function(){
        alert('Parent function, ' + this.value);
    }
});

Child = Parent.extend({
    value: "Child value",
    func: function(){
        alert('Child function, ' + this.value);
    },
    test: function(){
        this.constructor.__super__.func.call(this);
        //Parent.prototype.func.call(this)
    }
});

var child = new Child();

child.test();

// prints: Parent function, Child value
// should print: Parent function, Parent value initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, 'func');
} test() Parent.prototype.func.call(this)

@TITLE:How to validate fields tied to radio buttons?
@CONTENT:I have a contact form which requires a name, method of contact (email or telephone), an email or telephone text-field(depending on which radio button is clicked) and a description. I'm validating with jQuery's Validation plug in. The email field appears when one clicks on the email radio button and the same for the telephone field. My question is how would the code look to validate the email text-field when the email radio button is clicked and validate the telephone text-field when the telephone radio button is clicked. One of them should be required but not both. If it helps, when I click on the email radio button the email text-field appears and the telephone text-field disappears and vice-versa.

@TITLE:Applescript: Create folders/subfolders and move multiple files
@CONTENT:I have an Applescript question that is much more complex than I can construct. I have been searching for the past couple of days, and I cannot find any script like this, nor can I find enough information to piece one together with my limited knowledge. I have multiple files with structured names. Each file has the following name structure: ttu_collectionname_000001.pdf ttu_collectionname_000002.mp3 ttu_collectionname_000003.pdf ... etc. (Each of these files are of varying file types.) There is also a csv metadata file associated with each of the original files. ttu_collectionname_000001.csv ttu_collectionname_000002.csv ttu_collectionname_000003.csv ... etc. (Each of these files are csv files.) I need to create a folder based on the name of the file with sub and sub-subfolders. Each top-level folder name will be unique in the number sequence. Each sub and sub-subfolder name will be the same for each top-level folder. The folder structure should look like this: ttu_collectionname_000001 content archive display metadata archive display ttu_collectionname_000002 content archive display metadata archive display I then need to move the each file to a particular sub-subfolder. The file ttu_collectionname_000001.pdf would be moved to the ttu_collectionname_000001/content/display folder. The file ttu_collectionname_000001.csv would be moved to the ttu_collectionname_000001/metadata/display folder.

@LINK:/questions/14526591/tabs-newlines-documentfilters-and-eclipse-text
@TITLE:Tabs, newlines, DocumentFilters and eclipse text
@CONTENT:So, I have an additional issue regarding THIS question. Once I apply the fix, go to notepad, typeout bunch of tabs and newlines with some random characters and then paste them into my program, it all works peachy. However, being the closest text with bunch of tabs and newlines, I tried pasting a part the code itself to the JTextArea. All tabs and newlines stuck there and weren't filtered out. Although my users probably won't paste eclipse code into my program , I can't be sure that eclipse code is the only exception. So I'd like to know why is this happening. Also, I'd like for my code to filter out the blank characters except for space caracter and turn them into space character. I think tab and newline are the only ones, but if there are any more, please let me know. Anyway, what do I have to change to make it work? Here's the fixed SSCCE: package core;

            fb.insertString(offs, str, a);
        }

    } }

 It's Java 1.7. Create a new project, package core, file Main. Document filter is the first class and it's applied to the JTextArea you'll see. Everything you need is within that class. EDIT: I fixed the SSCCE. Also, the problem only occurs when you try to paste more character that can fit the JTextArea (I set limit to 2000). Then tas and newlines wont get filtered out.

@TITLE:The mystery of the added padding
@CONTENT:I recently designed and finished 2 newsletters; but when I went back to make a quick change (add a background color to the outside of the container) I realized that there is some mystery padding between the content and the background color, what I'm trying to accomplish is to get the background color right up against the edge of the main content. I've played around with the CSS quite a bit, but still haven't come up with a fix.. Here's the full source of the newsletter: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

 and I am getting this error: SQL Exception: State : null Message: There was no result set returned by the statement. Error : 0 I don't understand the problem with the result test.

@TITLE:Notification for keyboard
@CONTENT:I have a variable 'balance' which I'm initializing to '0' onClick of a button which calls my custom adapter 'MyAdpater'. I've an EditText in my activity. When I hide/show the keyboard, I don't get notified about it. I've vainly tried configChnage Method already.  @Override
 public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {
    super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);

    Toast.makeText(Ledger.this, "Config Change has been called.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    // Checks whether a hardware or on-screen keyboard is available
    balance = 0;
        ourCursor = db.getLedger(et.getText().toString(), from.getText()
                .toString(), to.getText().toString());

        id.clear();
        adapter = new MyAdapter(Ledger.this, ourCursor, false);
        lv.setAdapter(adapter);
}
 (This method isn't called when keyboard (dis)appears because the Toast doesn't appear.) This is my code class MyAdapter extends CursorAdapter {
    public MyAdapter(Context context, Cursor c, boolean autoRequery) {
        super(context, c, autoRequery);
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
        balance = 0;
    }

    @Override
    public void bindView(View view, Context ctxt, Cursor c) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

        TextView tv1 = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.tvAB1);
        TextView tv2 = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.tvAB2);
        TextView tv3 = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.tvAB3);
        TextView tv4 = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.tvAB4);
        TextView tv5 = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.tvAB5);
        String date = c.getString(1);
        tv1.setText(date.substring(6, 8) + "/" + date.substring(4, 6) + "/"
                + date.substring(0, 4));
        tv2.setText("" + c.getDouble(3));
        tv3.setText("" + c.getDouble(4));
        balance = balance + c.getDouble(4) - c.getDouble(3);
        tv4.setText("" + (balance));
        tv5.setText((c.getDouble(3) > c.getDouble(4) ? "CR." : "DR."));
    }

                R.layout.text_view_for_list_view_account_balance, parent,
                false);
    }
}
 It doesn't initialize the value of my variable 'balance = 0' as I show/hide the keyboard & therefore, the value of balance just keeps on increasing every time I show/hide the keyboard. I want to set balance = 0 whenever I show/hide the keyboard. Is there any method to do this? Please help. Thanks. :)

@TITLE:Change google maps marker icon when external link is clicked?
@CONTENT:I have a google map with lots of markers on it (gathered from MySQL database). I'm currently using the following code to change a marker's icon when that marker is clicked: var redbikeicon = "images/bike_red.png";

<?php
    $result=mysql_query("select * from sites") or die(mysql_error());
    while($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
        ?>
        marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: new google.maps.LatLng(<?php echo $row['Latitude']; ?>, <?php echo $row['Longitude']; ?>),
        map: map, icon: bikeicon});

        //add event to every marker
        google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function(){
            //change icon color
            this.setIcon(redbikeicon);      //replace default icon with red version (color-marking all chosen markers)

        })
        <?php
    }
    ?>
 This code works fine, but I now need to make the same thing happen when a link on the page is clicked - there is a list of links on the page next to the map, and each one corresponds to one of the markers on the map. When a link is clicked, the corresponding marker should change colors just like it does when the marker itself is clicked. How do I accomplish this?
@CODE:var redbikeicon = "images/bike_red.png";

<?php
    $result=mysql_query("select * from sites") or die(mysql_error());
    while($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
        ?>
        marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: new google.maps.LatLng(<?php echo $row['Latitude']; ?>, <?php echo $row['Longitude']; ?>),
        map: map, icon: bikeicon});

        //add event to every marker
        google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function(){
            //change icon color

@TITLE:Is CGPoint in MKPolygonView?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out a way to detect which MKOverlayView (actually MKPolygonView) was tapped and then change its color. I got it running with this code: - (void)mapTapped:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)recognizer {

    MKMapView *mapView = (MKMapView *)recognizer.view;
    MKPolygonView *tappedOverlay = nil;
    for (id<MKOverlay> overlay in mapView.overlays)
    {
        MKPolygonView *view = (MKPolygonView *)[mapView viewForOverlay:overlay];

        if (view){
            // Get view frame rect in the mapView's coordinate system
            CGRect viewFrameInMapView = [view.superview convertRect:view.frame toView:mapView];
            // Get touch point in the mapView's coordinate system
            CGPoint point = [recognizer locationInView:mapView];
            // Check if the touch is within the view bounds
            if (CGRectContainsPoint(viewFrameInMapView, point))
            {

                tappedOverlay = view;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    if([[tappedOverlay fillColor] isEqual:[[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2]]){
        [listOverlays addObject:tappedOverlay];
        tappedOverlay.fillColor = [[UIColor redColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];
    }
    else{
        [listOverlays removeObject:tappedOverlay];
        tappedOverlay.fillColor = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];
    }
    //tappedOverlay.strokeColor = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];

}
 Which works but sometimes, depending where I tap it gets wrong which MKPolygonView was tapped. I suppose because CGRectContainsPoint doesnt calculate properly the area, since it's not a rectangle it's a Polygon. What other methods there are to do this? I tried CGPathContainsPoint but I get worse results.
@CODE:MKOverlayView MKPolygonView - (void)mapTapped:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)recognizer {

    MKMapView *mapView = (MKMapView *)recognizer.view;
    MKPolygonView *tappedOverlay = nil;
    for (id<MKOverlay> overlay in mapView.overlays)
    {
        MKPolygonView *view = (MKPolygonView *)[mapView viewForOverlay:overlay];

        if (view){
            // Get view frame rect in the mapView's coordinate system
            CGRect viewFrameInMapView = [view.superview convertRect:view.frame toView:mapView];
            // Get touch point in the mapView's coordinate system
            CGPoint point = [recognizer locationInView:mapView];
            // Check if the touch is within the view bounds
            if (CGRectContainsPoint(viewFrameInMapView, point))
            {

                tappedOverlay = view;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    if([[tappedOverlay fillColor] isEqual:[[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2]]){
        [listOverlays addObject:tappedOverlay];
        tappedOverlay.fillColor = [[UIColor redColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];
    }
    else{
        [listOverlays removeObject:tappedOverlay];
        tappedOverlay.fillColor = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];
    }
    //tappedOverlay.strokeColor = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];

} MKPolygonView CGRectContainsPoint CGPathContainsPoint

@CONTENT:Still pretty new to entity framework. So forgive me if this is a noob question. Hoping someone can shed some light on this. I am trying to select data from 3 related tables. Leagues -> Teams -> Rosters -> 
 The relationships are League.LeagueID => Team.LeagueID => Roster.TeamID In the Roster table there is a PlayerID column I need a query that can select all leagues where Roster has PlayerID = 1 I cannot seem to filter results on the grandchild record no matter what I try. Not finding too much on the internet either. I have found a way to do this with anonymous types but those are read only so i can make changes to the data. I must be able to update the data after it returns.

@LINK:/questions/14523831/deserializing-a-many-to-one-relation-with-flexjson
@TITLE:Deserializing a many-to-one relation with FlexJSON
@CONTENT:I am adding RESTful support to my web application (with Spring) so I can do CRUD operations like this: Read info about a participant (JSONSerialize): $ curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/dancingwithstars/participant/1
{
    "birthDate": "2013-01-23",
    "code": "JS0001",
    "firstName": "Julia",
    "mainFunction": {
        "code": "AA"
        "name": "Principal Dancer"
    },
    "gender": "F",
    "height": 160.00,
    "id": 1,
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "version": 1,
    "weight": 55.00
}
 Or create a new participant (JSONDeserialize) $ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{"birthDate":"2013-01-15","code":"AT0001","firstName":"Angela","mainFunction":{"code": "AB", "name":"Choreografer"},"gender":"F","height":189.00,"lastName":"Wright","version":0,"weight":76.00}' http://localhost:8080/dancingwithstars/participants
 But the thing is, I don't need to know all the fields of the mainFunction object to create a participant I just need to know the code which is unique. For the serialization I can use: return new JSONSerializer().include("mainFunction.code").exclude("mainFunction.*").exclude("*.class").transform(new DateTransformer("yyyy-MM-dd"), Date.class).prettyPrint(true).serialize(this);
 And I get the following json: {
    "birthDate": "2013-01-23",
    "code": "JS0001",
    "firstName": "Julia",
    "mainFunction": {
        "code": "AA"
    },
    "gender": "F",
    "height": 160.00,
    "id": 1,
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "version": 1,
    "weight": 55.00
}
 For the deserialization I don't know. The requirement seems pretty common so I wanted to ask in the forum. Any ideas? To sum up, there is a parent object with a reference (many-to-one) to a child object. If I provide the parent with all the information of the child, everything works fine. But hold on a second, with the ID of the child should be enough to safe the parent. I try to save the parent with just the ID of the child and then I get this exception: org.hibernate.TransientPropertyValueException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing Any thoughts? Agustin UPDATE 27-Jan-2013: It looks like the issue comes from Hibernate. Let say we have products and categories. The relation is that products have a reference to a category (many-to-one relation). Given a category previously saved in a database. You cannot create a product and just give the ID of the category to create the product. You will need the version as well even though Hibernate won't look at the version to create the product. See below: /*
 * Create one category before the product
 */
Category cat1 = new Category();
cat1.setCode("KIT");
cat1.setName("Kitchen products");
session.save(cat1);
session.flush();
session.clear();
Category cat1db = (Category) session.get(Category.class, cat1.getCode());
logger.info(cat1.toString());
assertNotNull(cat1db.getVersion());

/*
 * Create the product and assign it a category
 */
Product p1 = new Product();
p1.setName("Kettle");
p1.setPrice(4D);
Category c1 = new Category();
c1.setCode("KIT");
//c1.setVersion(new Integer(666));
p1.setCategory(c1);
session.save(p1);
session.flush();
session.clear();
Product p1db = (Product) session.get(Product.class, p1.getId());
logger.info(p1.toString());
assertNotNull(p1db.getId());
 That will fail. But if you uncomment the version of the category, the product will be created. Also, Hibernate will do an extra query to the database asking for that category. Two questions here: Why Hibernate needs the field version even though it doesn't look a it in the end? Why Hibernate does an extra query asking for the category? Your thoughts?

@TITLE:Cancel FileUpload when FileSizeMax is exceeded
@CONTENT:I have a JSF application which runs in JBoss 6.1 which uses internal the Tomcat Servlet container. I've realised the upload with apache commons file upload. I want to prevent too large file uploads and have set the property fileSizeMax to 10MB within the class FileUploadBase. It works, the file upload throws an FileSizeLimitExceededException for all files larger than 10MB. This exception throws within less than a second. But the main problem is, that the whole file will be transferred over the network. I have found this out by checking the network traffic. Afterwards the redirect to the error page is done. How can I interrupt the file transfer when the max size is exceeded without transferring the whole file? I assume that the file will be transferred in multiple packages because of the web form attribute enctype ="multipart/form-data".

@LINK:/questions/14523135/c-square-bracket-alternative-a-class-for-multiple-soap-addresses
@TITLE:C#: square bracket alternative / a class for multiple SOAP addresses
@CONTENT:I've generated a SOAP class using wsdl.exe tool. Unfortunately, it seems to be bound to a specific URL and I need to be able to change it on per-instance basis (I'd like to be able to connect to multiple URLs that share the same interface). So, I'd like to change such code: /// <remarks/>
[System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("wsdl", "2.0.50727.3038")]
[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
[System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute("code")]
[System.Web.Services.WebServiceBindingAttribute(Name="Service1Soap", Namespace="http://productmarket.bigbrain.math.uni.lodz.pl/")]
public partial class Service1 : System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol {

// some code here

    /// <remarks/>
    [System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute("http://productmarket.bigbrain.math.uni.lodz.pl/Authenticate", RequestNamespace="http://productmarket.bigbrain.math.uni.lodz.pl/", ResponseNamespace="http://productmarket.bigbrain.math.uni.lodz.pl/", Use=System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle=System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Wrapped)]
    public bool Authenticate(int ContractorId, string Password) {
        object[] results = this.Invoke("Authenticate", new object[] {
                    ContractorId,
                    Password});
        return ((bool)(results[0]));
    }

// more code here

}
 So that the attributes from Authenticate (the ones with HTTP URL's) are variable. The only solution I've found so far is to make a static string inside of Service1 class and change the Authenticate code like that: /// <remarks/>
[System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("wsdl", "2.0.50727.3038")]

//some code

    public static string prefix = "http://productmarket.bigbrain.math.uni.lodz.pl/";
    public static string soap_namespace = "http://productmarket.bigbrain.math.uni.lodz.pl/";


    /// <remarks/>
    [System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute(Service1.prefix+"Authenticate", RequestNamespace=Service1.soap_namespace, ResponseNamespace=Service1.soap_namespace, Use=System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle=System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Wrapped)]
    public bool Authenticate(int ContractorId, string Password) {
        object[] results = this.Invoke("Authenticate", new object[] {
                    ContractorId,
                    Password});
        return ((bool)(results[0]));
    }

//some code

}
 Is there a better solution that would pull this info from instances instead of forcing me to change them every request? I must admit I don't exactly understand the concept of attributes in C#.

@TITLE:How to detect whether there is a specific member variable in class?
@CONTENT:For creating algorithm template function I need to know whether x or X (and y or Y) in class that is template argument. It may by useful when using my function for MFC CPoint class or GDI+ PointF class or some others. All of them use different x in them. My solution could be reduces to the following code: 
template<int> struct TT {typedef int type;};
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<sizeof(&P::x)>::type b = 0) { return true; }
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<sizeof(&P::X)>::type b = 0) { return false; }

struct P1 {int x; };
struct P2 {float X; };
// it also could be struct P3 {unknown_type X; };

int main()
{
    P1 p1 = {1};
    P2 p2 = {1};

    Check_x(p1); // must return true
    Check_x(p2); // must return false

    return 0;
}
 But it does not compile in Visual Studio, while compiling in the GNU C++. With Visual Studio I could use the following template: 
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<&P::x==&P::x>::type b = 0) { return true; }
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<&P::X==&P::X>::type b = 0) { return false; }
 But it does not compile in GNU C++. Is there universal solution? UPD: Structures P1 and P2 here are only for example. There are could be any classes with unknown members.
@CODE:template<int> struct TT {typedef int type;};
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<sizeof(&P::x)>::type b = 0) { return true; }
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<sizeof(&P::X)>::type b = 0) { return false; }

struct P1 {int x; };
struct P2 {float X; };
// it also could be struct P3 {unknown_type X; };

int main()
{
    P1 p1 = {1};
    P2 p2 = {1};

    Check_x(p1); // must return true
    Check_x(p2); // must return false

    return 0;
} template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<&P::x==&P::x>::type b = 0) { return true; }
template<class P> bool Check_x(P p, typename TT<&P::X==&P::X>::type b = 0) { return false; }

@CONTENT:I want to fetch the actual URL of the request made by the client, how do I do that? I mean if someone requests a page that does not exists, like, http://localhost/invalid.php, and I have set 404 custom error file to http://localhost/test.php, then how do I get to know what was the actual URL requested by the user. I have tried this in IIS7. I have set the Custom Error Page to /test.php, and whenever the user requests a URL which does not exist, I could still access that URL using $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] in /test.php and the URL in browsers still remains the same. But I am having problem doing the same in Apache. I have set the Custom Error Page to /test.php but when user requests a page which doesn't exist, the user is redirected to a /test.php and I cant access the actual URL which the user requested. I've tried this print_r($_SERVER) but did not find the actual request URL any where in the $_SERVER array.

@TITLE:.NET: ApplicationSettingsBase unreliable?
@CONTENT:In a larger application that makes use of Application Settings, sometimes some settings are not saved. When the following code is executed, everything works fine: Properties.Settings.Default.SomeSetting.X = 42;
Properties.Settings.Default.SomeSetting.Y = true;
Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
 But this code Properties.Settings.Default.SomeSetting.X = 42;
Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
Properties.Settings.Default.SomeSetting.Y = true;
Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
 does call the getter of Y during the first call to Save(), but not during the second call to Save(), and the value of Y will not change in the XML file written. The code of course is more complicated, the settings are far more complicated, and the statements are not just right one after the other, but it basically works like this. I tried to reproduce this with a simple program, but did not succeed (yet?). BTW: The settings file always gets written correctly. There are no exceptions, handled or unhandled. I'm still investigating, however I wanted to ask you: Is ApplicationSettingsBase working reliably? Any experiences with this? Thank you!

@TITLE:ggplot2 how to get 2 histograms with the y value = to count of one / sum of the count of both
@CONTENT:I guess my question is simple (even if the title is not...) but I was not able to find any clear answer yet. I want to plot histograms of Reaction Times in a psychophysics task. I need to plot two of them on the same figure: one for correct responses, the other for incorrect responses. I don't want to plot the absolute counts, but rather the relative proportion corresponding to: For correct responses: count(correct==1) / sum(count(correct==1) + count(correct==0)) For incorrect responses: count(correct==0) / sum(count(correct==1) + count(correct==0)) For now I have that: ggplot(data, aes(x=RT, color=correct)) 
    + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..count../sum(..count..))) 
    + stat_bin(breaks = seq(5,800,by=10))
 But I'm not sure it is doing what I want (is the sum corresponding to the sum of both correct and incorrect responses?). I don't feel comfortable with the ..count.. etc, would anyone have a good recommendation for documentation about this aspect? Thanks in advance. Edit: The input data is: df <- structure(list(RT = c(359L, 214L, 219L, 206L, 120L, 166L, 156L, 
       181L, 135L, 122L, 110L, 101L, 139L, 215L, 106L, 217L, 162L, 135L,

       "correct"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -20L))
 Here is a link to a plot I made earlier using base R which is exactly the output I want at the end. https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqn83pkoq7o0stv/RTexample.png These are lines (but based on histograms, yellow for correct==1, blue for correct==0). The specific feature that I want is that both line together sum up to 1.

 This is my jQGrid code jQuery("#list").jqGrid({
    //start
    url: 'Home/Search',
    datatype: "json",
    postData: {
        viewModel: function () { return $("#search-form").serialize(); }
    },
    mtype: "POST",
   //etc.. other config goes
 });
 Here is my controller code  [HttpPost]
 public JsonResult Search(SearchViewModel viewModel)
 {
  //viewModel parameter is always null
  var searchResult=//getting records from DB and preparing structure for jQGrid
  //Request["PostData"] gives json array sting of my form field and its value
  Json(searchResult);

 }
 I tried following this post also. jQgrid posting custom data on load. But SearchViewModel object is null. But i can see it in Requst["PostData"] value as a JSON string of my form field name and its value. This mean my form is posting successfully to the server with the data as JSON sting. How can i directly get those JSON string to direct strongly typed model. But i could see Request.Params["viewModel"] contains the form element details Any one could help to get my form posted as view model? or Do i need to write my own custom model binder ?
@CODE:public class SearchViewModel
{
public string Name{get;set;}
public string Location{get;set;}
public string EmployeeId{get;set;}
}

@model UI.ViewModel.SearchViewModel

<div id="search-panel">
    @{Html.EnableClientValidation();}
    @using (Html.BeginForm("Search", "Home", 
                 FormMethod.Post, new { id = "search-form" }))
    {
        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
        <div class="formfield-container">
            <label>
                <span class="column">Name:</span>
                @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Name)
            </label>
        </div>
        <div class="formfield-container">
            <label>
                <span class="column">Emp Id:</span>
                @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.EmployeeId)
            </label>
        </div>
        <div class="formfield-container">
            <label>
                <span class="column">Location:</span>
               @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Location)
            </label>
        </div>
 } jQuery("#list").jqGrid({
    //start

@LINK:/questions/14520265/how-to-serialize-a-user-regarding-authentication
@TITLE:How to serialize a user regarding authentication?
@CONTENT:I'm have an authenticated section on my app, but the authentication is done via oauth to a 3rd party service. I get the 200 callback from the service, now I create/find my user and set him as logged in. So my provider is: providers:
    users:
        entity: { class: MainBundle:User, property: id }
 My user implements the security's UserInterface, although I don't have the username, password, etc properties on my user entity. I assume the id is then the only identifier I can use then. My token is set as follows: $token = new UsernamePasswordToken($user, null, 'secured_area', $user->getRoles());
$this->securityContext->setToken($token);
 I wish to do this without using JMS bundle for now; my serialization looks like this: /**
 * Serialize
 * @return string|void
 */
public function serialize()
{
    return serialize(array(
        'id' => $this->getId(),
        'display_name' => $this->getDisplayName(),
        'email' => $this->getEmail(),
    ));
}

/**
 * Unserialize
 * @return mixed|void
 */
public function unserialize($data)
{
    $data = unserialize($data);
    $this->setId($data['id']);
    $this->setDisplayName($data['display_name']);
    $this->setEmail($data['email']);
    return $this;
}
 Using the above I get an infinite loop redirect. At first I only serialized the id, but then all the other properties of the user isn't available. Then I tried serializing the whole object ($this), but that gives me a xdebug nesting level error of 1000. I'm a bit lost of how to make this authentication work with serialization
@CODE:providers:
    users:
        entity: { class: MainBundle:User, property: id } $token = new UsernamePasswordToken($user, null, 'secured_area', $user->getRoles());
$this->securityContext->setToken($token); /**
 * Serialize
 * @return string|void
 */
public function serialize()
{
    return serialize(array(
        'id' => $this->getId(),
        'display_name' => $this->getDisplayName(),
        'email' => $this->getEmail(),
    ));
}

/**
 * Unserialize
 * @return mixed|void
 */
public function unserialize($data)
{
    $data = unserialize($data);
    $this->setId($data['id']);
    $this->setDisplayName($data['display_name']);
    $this->setEmail($data['email']);
    return $this;

@TITLE:Fancybox doesn't trigger on $(elem).click(), but does on ¡§real¡¨ click?
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble getting fancybox to trigger. I have it set up to trigger when you click an element. I still don't know why, but for some reason fancybox only works if i bind it using live(), sort of like this: $(document).ready(function() {
    // This works
    $('.fancybox').live('mousedown', function() {
        $(this).fancybox();
    });

    // This doesn't
    $('.fancybox').fancybox();
});
 Read more about that here: Fancybox is loaded, but nothing happens, and no errors? The problem is, it only works if i actually click the element. If i try to trigger a click using: $('.fancybox').trigger('mousedown');
 i get nothing! It just doesn't work. The reason i need to do this is because the images are being printed out with PHP in a gallery (with thumbnails etc). I only want a dropdown of the available galleries, so on page load, i hide all of the thumbnails and then loop through them and create a dropdown menu containing all the galleries. So far so good! If i show the element using the inspector (using chrome) and then manually click on it, it works fine! Although, the problem is, when i try to trigger the click using the dropdown, nothing happens! I have it set up so that every <option> in the dropdown has a data attribute of the gallery/thumbnail ID, and when the dropdown changes (when you select an option), it automatically finds the correct image, and triggers a click - which in turn should open a fancybox. I know it finds the correct image, and clicks it, it's just that nothing happens when it's clicked. Try it! URL: http://goo.gl/r4Klf Rightclick on the first dropdown menu in the content, and inspect it. Above it, you'll see a bunch of .ngg-galleryoverview elements. Click on one of them and remove all the styling applied to the element (in element.style, the style basically hides the element). Then expand the element, and in there you'll see a .ngg-gallery-thumbnail. Remove display: none from the styling. You should now be able to see the element on the page. If you try clicking it, the fancybox will open. However, if you try to click it using $(the element).trigger('mousedown'), it's not going to work. Try targeting it using the href attribute, something like: jQuery('a[href="http://hallarna.se/wp-content/gallery/2013/spoksonatenloggaliten.jpg"]').trigger('mousedown');
 Please do note that jQuery is in noConflict mode meaning you will have to use jQuery() instead of $(). I've been battling this for several days now. Any ideas are super appreciated!
@CODE:live() $(document).ready(function() {
    // This works
    $('.fancybox').live('mousedown', function() {
        $(this).fancybox();
    });

    // This doesn't
    $('.fancybox').fancybox();
}); $('.fancybox').trigger('mousedown'); <option> .ngg-galleryoverview .ngg-gallery-thumbnail display: none $(the element).trigger('mousedown') jQuery('a[href="http://hallarna.se/wp-content/gallery/2013/spoksonatenloggaliten.jpg"]').trigger('mousedown');

 I have saved the font in images folder. Since it was not taking the font I created the copy of the font in the folder within my css file. Now it is working perfectly on chrome. But in mozilla the font is not getting read. I found that we can fix this by adding htaccess to the folder of the css file with content <FilesMatch "\.(ttf|otf|eot|woff|font.css)$">
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  </IfModule>
</FilesMatch>
 This is also not making any difference in firefox. So how can we fix this? any idea?

 I believe that my file uploaded to Heroku, may be cleared by the platform for issues of memory, for example, or because it saves them as temporary, is this possible? solutions! I repeat, everything works fine locally :(

@TITLE:Type geometry not found with postgis and hibernate-spatial
@CONTENT:I'm trying to setup a project with hibernate-spatial using postgis. Following the tutorial for hibernate-spatial 4.0-M1 I first run into the problem that the dependency postgis-jdbc-1.5.3.jar couldn't be found. Like suggested here by somebody I used the version 1.5.2 and the tutorial compiles. But I got an error if I try to run it. I set the debug-level for hibernate to debug und stumbled upon the following problem: DEBUG SQL -

 The error is german but means, that the type 'geometry' does not exist. If I take the create table statement and execute it in pgadmin it works find so I think that the database is setup correctly. My Versions: postgres          - 9.0     64Bit

@CONTENT:This is regarding xml transformation within BPEL. In my bpel process, data is coming from two separate sources (partnerLinks). Data from both sources is in the same xml format. I need to combine the data from the two XML documents into one xml document and then pass it back to the ESB. I was trying with bpel:doXslTransform()). I am not sure how to pass the two responses from the partnerLinks to this function in a single call. I tried concatenating the two responses into a string within a message type variable and then pass this to the bpel:doXslTransform(). Is this the right approach to merge the data?

@TITLE:How do I update the attributes of an attribute on an AR model?
@CONTENT:I am using the piggybak gem. I have a Product q: 1.9.3p194 :009 > q
 => #<Product id: 20, name: "iPad", description: "<p>\r\n\tiPad 11&quot; tablet that will change the way...", price: 499.0, vendor_id: 11, created_at: "2012-12-15 23:40:27", updated_at: "2013-01-01 00:18:39", image: "ipad.png", sku: "AB-09123"> 
 q has an attribute piggybak_sellable which has other attributes. 1.9.3p194 :010 > q.piggybak_sellable
 => nil 
 This is an example of the attributes available to a Product that has been assigned in the Rails Admin UI. 1.9.3p194 :011 > p.piggybak_sellable
 => #<Piggybak::Sellable id: 1, sku: "AR4590", description: "Blue Shirt", price: #<BigDecimal:7ffa1ba863b8,'0.2499E2',18(45)>, quantity: 100, item_id: 19, item_type: "Product", active: true, unlimited_inventory: false> 
 I would like to add those attributes to a nil record. I would like to update all those attributes of q.piggybak_sellable without having to do it manually i.e. setting q.piggybak_sellable.sku = "ARJHR", etc. I tried doing update_attributes and it didn't work: 1.9.3p194 :008 > q.piggybak_sellable.update_attributes(:sku => "YJ4567", :description => "Awesome tablet", :price => 399, :quantity => 100, :item_id => 20, :item_type => "Product", :active => true)
NoMethodError: undefined method `update_attributes' for nil:NilClass
 Thoughts on how I can do this? I am trying to put this in a callback on my Product model - for what it's worth. Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/14516843/mvvm-cancel-changes-in-wpf-listbox-vb-net
@TITLE:Mvvm - Cancel changes in Wpf Listbox, vb.net
@CONTENT:I have a wpv/mvvm-light/vb.net application with a master/detail view. In this view there is a listbox of clients and a detail view of the client's details where they user can view and edit the customers. I wanted to add a function where users would be prompted to save changes when a new client is selected in the listbox. If the user chooses yes from the messagebox then save changes and if no then discard changes and return previous selected item back to its original value. I have this all working fine. My problem is that when the user selects a new client and the messagebox asks them to save changes, the listbox goes out of sync. Meaning that the listbox shows the new client selected but the detail view still shows the previous client. The odd thing is that it works properly on rare occasions. The following is my view: <UserControl x:Class="FTC.View.ClientListView"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"

             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:FTC_Application"
             mc:Ignorable="d" 
             d:DesignHeight="400" d:DesignWidth="900">


                <ListBox    
                    Grid.Column="1" 
                    Width="350"                    
                    Style="{DynamicResource FTC_ListBox}"  
                    ItemTemplate="{DynamicResource FTC_ClientListTemplate}" 
                    ItemContainerStyle="{DynamicResource FTC_ListItem}"
                                ItemsSource="{Binding ClientViewSource.View}"

                        <!--all the display stuff goes here for the detail view-->
                    </ContentControl>

</UserControl>
 the following is the property in the viewmodel that the selecteditem of the listbox is bound to. It is also the binding for the content control that displays the details. Public Property Selection As client

                ''If they are the same, 
                If value Is _PreviousClient Then
                    Return
                End If

                ' Note that we actually change the value for now.This is necessary because WPF seems to query the
                '  value after the change. The list box likes to know that the value did change.
                If Me._Selection.HasChanges = True And _Selection.HasErrors = False Then

                                                                                  RaisePropertyChanged(ClientSelectedPropertyName)
                                                                                  ''continue with listbox selection changing to the new value for selection
                                                                                  _ClientCollectionViewSource.View.MoveCurrentTo(value)
                                                                              End Sub), DispatcherPriority.Normal, Nothing)
                        Return
                    Else
                        ''save changes to database
                        SaveExecute()
                    End If
                End If

                _Selection = value

                _Selection.HasChanges = False
                RaisePropertyChanged(ClientSelectedPropertyName)

                ''clone the unchanged version of the current selected client on na original variable
                objHelper.CopyProperties(_Selection, _OriginalClient)

            End Set
        End Property
 SO the idea is that if the user does not want to save changes, an original value of the client is copied (using reflection) over the current value, then the ui is updated and the selection continues on to the new value chosen by the user. However, like I said above, the listbox does not reflect this change even though I tired to hard code it with the following line: ''continue with listbox selection changing to the new value for selection  
 _ClientCollectionViewSource.View.MoveCurrentTo(value)
 I got this solution by working customizing the solution posted HERE can anyone help me figure out why my listbox goes out of sync when this happens. Thanks in advance

@TITLE:How to split chart into multiple pages like cross tab in JasperReports Server?
@CONTENT:I want to split a horizontal Bar chart into multiple pages, as the Category Expressions dataset is huge around 200, which is resulting the graph to be in an unreadable format. I want something like, the Category Expression dataset to be distributed in blocks of 15, as to display first 15 categories in page1, and so on. I was wondering, if its doable in JasperReports Server using iReport Professional 4.5.0.

@TITLE:openGL glx.h missing form xcode 4 mac lion
@CONTENT:I'm trying to setup an example project, which uses GLSDK . I set it up with premake, (setting the projects base sdk to 10.6 since I'm on xcode 4) but when I try to compile I get "GL/gl.h not found" from the example files. So I manually add the opengl framework and change GL/gl.h to OpenGl/gl.h and it works, but then I get the same error for a different line , and now I realize that header doesn't exist in the opengl framework, even though it should. I can see it getting reference in other programs and i see it example code all the time. But for some reason it doesn't exist on my computer? Or am I missing something like I usually do. Just for reference I'm tying to set up the example projects here and I'm certain my screwing something up.

@TITLE:loading same gstreamer elements multiple times in a process
@CONTENT:This may be silly question. How gstreamer elements are loaded multiple times in a process?. When Gstreamer elements are created are they shared if already one created and present in memory? In my case, one process creates multiple thread, for each thread I am creating following gstreamer elements, linking and set pipeline to PLAYING state, filesrc->Q->filesink and this works. But when I add gstreamer element(newly written for processing gst buffers data) between Q->filesink all thread stops working, what might be the problem? How can I debug? Please provide inputs. Thanks in advance. -opensid

@TITLE:How to use Django build-in comment framework on any template
@CONTENT:I just begin to study Django build-in comments function. at first I think the comment template should work well on any page just with get_comment_form or render_comment_form .but now it really annoying when i add these code to a ordinary page. It doesn't work. maybe in a other word. I don't know how to specify the object to attached to when it come to a normal page. below is the detail message : models.py
class Entry(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = models.TextField()
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField()
    enable_comments = models.BooleanField()

urls.py
urlpatterns = patterns('',
url(r'^profile/','django.views.generic.simple.direct_to_template',{
        'template' : 'admin_ryu_blog/profile.html'},name='profile'),
)
 now i just want to using comment framework on template profile.html. what should i do ? you could regard profile.html as a blank page now. then you can add any code you want if you can get a comment form displayed with build-in comment framework. btw I have tried the below method : {% load comments %}
{% render_comment_form for profile %} 
 then it prompt a error message. the same traceback on my previous question . click here!
@CODE:models.py

@TITLE:How do I pass data between cards in Java CardLayout
@CONTENT:I am new to working with Java GUI, I know this may sound ridiculous but I have been trying for days to pass data between cards on the CardLayout layout. I am using netbeans, the first card displays a list clients. When a client is selected, the choice selection is passed to a variable on that card. The next card queries the database to show more details about the client selected. I can handle the switching between cards but my problem is I can't pass the data stored in the variable on card 1 to card 2. I have visited several forums and read through similar questions asked but I just cannot get any of the proposed solutions to work. Please help, I'm new at this so please go easy on me, thanks.

@TITLE:How to setup a MapViewController as Datasource to a TableViewController for displaying distance in cells
@CONTENT:My app has a tabbarcontroller with a UIViewController (FirstViewController-calling it mapVC) with a mapview and a UITableViewController (SecondViewController-calling it tableVC). The app fetches data from web and puts it into CD-db and each VC executes a fetch to the db. Each entity is named Holiday (dont ask) and it has a lat and long property. Here is the UITabBarController subclass which attempts to set the mapVC as datasource to tableVC: - (void)viewDidLoad{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    FirstViewController *mapVC;
    SecondViewController *tableVC;

    for(UIViewController *anyVC in self.viewControllers)
    {
        if([anyVC.class isKindOfClass:[SecondViewController class]]){
            tableVC = (SecondViewController *)anyVC;
        } else if ([anyVC.class isKindOfClass:[FirstViewController class]]){
            mapVC = (FirstViewController *)anyVC;
        }
    }

    tableVC.tableView.dataSource = mapVC;
    tableVC.tableView.delegate = mapVC;
}
 Here are the relevant parts of mapVC: #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

 Specific Questions: 1) If I added the cFRAIP (noris & nosit) method in mapVC (the new datasource) do I need to remove it from tableVC? 2) If I remove cFRAIP and the other 2 (noris and nosit) methods from tableVC, it crashes because there is no datasource. So the tabbarcontroller assignment of datasource doesnt seem to be working. 3) Finally if I have to remove cFRAIP from tableVC, I will lose my ability to UISearchBar the tableview. Or am I wrong? When I run the app, the mapVC is the selected vc. The UIButton in the toolbar that calls plotStoreLocations in mapVC is greyed out until the web fetch finishes. At this point the console logs the self.farsiman locations which are Holiday entities. And I can see all the entities log into the console. When I click the plot button, the userLocation is logged correctly as specified in the plotStorePositions and the distance value for each annotation is correct. So the distance for each MKAnnotation is calculated correctly. When I switch to the tableVC tab, the new self.dates array is logged in the console (because I currently have the tableVC do another CD-db fetch. And I get this for each pin location: Already in CFRAIP pinLocations is <+15.50288611,-88.02716389> +/- 0.00m (speed -1.00 mps / course -1.00) @ 1/24/13, 8:20:39 PM Central Standard Time, userLocation is (null) which is called from the calculateDistanceForLat which is called by the CFRAIP. And every distance in the cell detail is -0.001.

@TITLE:Excel VBA to get website Title from url
@CONTENT:HTML Page Title in Excel VBA I know that this is fairly old but I'm having difficulty with this. I've built a browswer history parser that goes through the history data from Firefox, IE, Safari, and Chrome on our users computers (Office) and then it gets titles for pages that don't using this code. I get popups from IE even though it should be hidden. Do you want to leave this page, download popups, install this ActiveX this or thats that I have to close out as they come up. Is there a way to suppress those or automatically close those from VBA? If I don't do it by hand the computer/Excel eventually stops working as I end up with several unclosed IE windows or it errors out because it can't open anymore IE instances. Plus I feel pretty sick knowing that IE is opening sites that I don't know anything about. We have more infections in this office than I have ever had to deal with before. We have to use IE for the company software to run on. Is there a better way of doing this or are we just victims of the system. I'm just awestruck at how little can actually be done in MS Office VBA compared to OOo BASIC. At least basic feature wise (redimensioning arrays, FTP support). Please for the love of monkeys let there be a better way. I've also tried.... Function fgetMetaTitle(ByVal strURL) As String

@TITLE:Facebook iOS6 integration adds image to album and not separate posts
@CONTENT:I am trying to post to Facebook from my iOS app using the Social Framework. Using the SLComposeViewController, I have successfully added text and image to a Facebook post SLComposeViewController *postVC = [SLComposeViewController composeViewControllerForServiceType:SLServiceTypeFacebook];
[postVC setInitialText:messageText];
[postVC addImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"share-this.png"]];
[self presentViewController:composeVC animated:YES completion:nil];
 Now, the user of my app can post multiple times to their timeline within minutes. When I try this, Facebook collates all the posts into the album "iOS Photos" and does not show it as a separate post. This is what it shows - John Doe added 3 photos to the album iOS Photos. I want to know if there is a way that I can post them as separate posts and not having them collated into an album. Can I do this using the SLComposeViewController's methods itself or do I have to manage posting to Facebook myself using the various Account management APIs in Social Framework?
@CODE:SLComposeViewController *postVC = [SLComposeViewController composeViewControllerForServiceType:SLServiceTypeFacebook];
[postVC setInitialText:messageText];
[postVC addImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"share-this.png"]];

 ????It throws an error saying the subscript is out of range, and I understand that this means the index was not found within the Workbooks collection, this statement is here because usually the file is already open as an addin so I can just get a reference to it through this statement.

If I open the workbook while connected to the network this error is not thrown. ????Has anyone experienced this before?

@TITLE:.htaccess Redirect based on HTTP_REFERER being empty
@CONTENT:I'm trying to set up a redirect on a WP blog installation that will detect anyone coming in from nowhere (i.e. not from another site). The idea is to trap some of the spambots that plug pre-constructed URLs into the system to create comments/posts. I figure if they don't have a referrer site, I can pop them back to the homepage (www.domain.com/index.php or just www.domain.com), which should mess with the bots but not with real people. I understand that the referrers can be forged but hopefully it'll stop the stupids, at least. I have very little clue about .htaccess rewrite rules (I apologise for being a noob), but I couldn't find one that did this in existing answers or anywhere else online, despite several searches. Either no one's done it or I'm not phrasing correctly. Any help appreciated. :)

@CONTENT:I'm consuming a notoriously unreliable SOAP web service in a c# MVC project. I have no control over that service. It will occasionally just stop responding for extended periods. Is there a simple way, from the client side, to continue to retry sending the message, at a set interval, until I receive a response back from the service? I've looked at MSMQ and ws-reliability but, it appears to me, both options require some control over the web service. Is there anything out there to help me to do this from the client side?

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Remove jsessionid from URL I have a stateless Spring application, so I have no use for sessions. I would like to disable everything that has to do with sessions. I have a context.xml Tomcat config, where I have added this: <Manager pathname="" />

@LINK:/questions/14510191/open-in-safari-from-uiwebview-using-youtube-com
@TITLE:Open in Safari from UIWebView (using youtube.com)
@CONTENT:This has been the most frustrating thing I've ever had the misfortune of doing, ever. I have a UIWebView. It goes to http://m.youtube.com. I want any subsequent link I press to then be sent to Safari, not the UIWebView. Simple, right? Here's the code you'll find over and over again: - (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {
    if (navigationType == UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkClicked) {

        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:request.URL];
        return NO;
    }

    return YES;
}
 But this doesn't work. So I changed UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkClicked to UIWebViewNavigationTypeOther. This instantly open in Safari when the view loads. Again not what I want. So I did this: - (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {
    if (navigationType == UIWebViewNavigationTypeOther) {

        NSLog(@"It works!");

//        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:[urlArr objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]]];
       return YES;
   }

   return NO;
}
 to check if subsequent clicks even go through here and they don't. The log only shows "It works!" when the view initially loads. Any subsequent clicks show nothing. So I've tried looking out for a URL change and Javascript change but still nothing. Is there anything else I can do? (By the way I should mention that this code does work on any other website, like stackoverflow.com - any subsequent link clicks and I'm taken to Safari. It only doesn't work with YouTube) This is what I get from the log when I press a link on youtube: 2013-01-24 21:08:25.886 HatFilms[30079:c07] [MPAVController] Autoplay: Enabling autoplay

@TITLE:Inserting Large Object into Postgresql returns 53200 Out of Memory error
@CONTENT:Postgresql 9.1 NPGSQL 2.0.12 I have binary data I am wanting to store in a postgresql database. Most files load fine, however, a large binary (664 Mb) file is causing problems. When trying to load the file to postgresql using Large Object support through Npgsql, the postgresql server returns 'out of memory' error. I'm running this at present on a workstation with 4Gb RAM, with 2Gb free with postgresql running in an idle state. This is the code I am using, adapted from PG Foundry Npgsql User's Manual. using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        var manager = new NpgsqlTypes.LargeObjectManager(connection);
        var noid = manager.Create(NpgsqlTypes.LargeObjectManager.READWRITE);
        var lo = manager.Open(noid, NpgsqlTypes.LargeObjectManager.READWRITE);
        lo.Write(BinaryData);
        lo.Close();
        transaction.Commit();
        return noid;
    }
    catch
    {
        transaction.Rollback();
        throw;
    }
}
 I've tried modifying postgresql's memory settings from defaults to all manner of values adjusting: shared_buffers work_mem maintenance_work_mem So far I've found postgresql to be a great database system, but this is a show stopper at present and I can't seem to get this sized file into the database. I don't really want to have to deal with manually chopping the file into chunks and recreating client side if I can help it. Please help!?

@TITLE:SSRS 2008 dynamic Parameters
@CONTENT:. We are currently using MS SQL server 2008 R2 along with SSRS 2008. I am creating a report with several parameters for users to insert data into a table. Staff_Name that is filled with a SP. Client_Name that is filled based on the Staff_Name choice from a SP. The user will pick the option of 'New Service' or a service already inserted prieviously by the user. Textboxs and date fields that the user will enter data to be inserted into the Table. What I would like the report to do is when the user selects 'New Service' the textboxs and data fields would be blank. If the user selects a service they already create to update fields (inserting a new row into the table and recorddeleting the old row.) I have created the SP for the textboxs and date fields to be populated based on the 3rd choice: IF @ClientServiceId <> 'New%' BEGIN
SELECT 
  cc.Date_Service_Referral, cc.Ordering_Provider, cc.Provider_Specialty, cc.Provider_Contact, cc.Desc_of_Order,
  cc.First_Scheduled_Date_Service, cc.Attendance_Confirmed, cc.Date_Record_New_Service_Receieved,
  cc.Date_Record_Ordering_Provider_Confirmed, cc.Date_Record_PCP_Confirmed  
FROM CCMT_Service_Referral_Tracking cc
WHERE cc.Client_Service_Id = @ClientServiceId 
AND cc.RecordDeleted = 'N'
END
IF @ClientServiceId = 'New%' BEGIN
SELECT 
  NULL AS Date_Service_Referral, NULL AS Ordering_Provider, NULL AS Provider_Specialty, NULL AS Provider_Contact, 
  NULL AS Desc_of_Order, NULL AS First_Scheduled_Date_Service, NULL AS Attendance_Confirmed, 
  NULL AS Date_Record_New_Service_Receieved, NULL AS Date_Record_Ordering_Provider_Confirmed, 
  NULL AS Date_Record_PCP_Confirmed 
END
 Setting the values of the user defined parameters to the default values of the SSRS seems to lock the parameters even after the third parameter changes and using it as the available values creates a Dropdown the will not allow the user to enter data. Is there a way to code this so it will populate the parameters or leave them null depending on the user third choice?
@CODE:IF @ClientServiceId <> 'New%' BEGIN
SELECT 
  cc.Date_Service_Referral, cc.Ordering_Provider, cc.Provider_Specialty, cc.Provider_Contact, cc.Desc_of_Order,
  cc.First_Scheduled_Date_Service, cc.Attendance_Confirmed, cc.Date_Record_New_Service_Receieved,

@TITLE:Page stops rendering after PHP include() function
@CONTENT:Basically I'm having a go at using PHP to create a basic CMS for my website. I'm trying to write a script which creates a SPRY navigation bar from a CSV file, but the server stops rendering when it reaches the include() function which calls the script. I've checked the Apache error logs and there's nothing in there, also at the beginning of the script I echo'd a HTML comment, but that doesn't appear in the page source, so it would seem it doesn't even start to run? Any ideas as to what it could be? Template Header File (Included with PHP in main page file, works fine): <div id="header">

If there are no such ¡V is there a way to utilize heavyweight databases such as PostreSQL (MySQL or any other major player) as in-memory database?

@TITLE:how to set up SSL for Apache for a Mac so I can test Cross Domain iFrame on IE8
@CONTENT:I set up Apache on with the standard self-signed ssl mods to my http.conf, and this is working locally on my mac, but when I try to access it from my windows machine with IE8 it doesn't seem to like the certificate. I've tried to import the certificate into the Windows -> Internet Options modal, but that just doesn't seem to work for accessing the iFrame cross domain. IE shows that yellow alert at the bottom of the page warning about an iFrame, but doesn't load the other files from that domain. After I accept the alert, the page reloads and the same thing occurs. In production this works with the real certs. Any ideas on what might be wrong with my development environment and my certs? UPDATE I opened the command-line in admin mode and flushed the cache. No help. I am able to ping the domain name and get the correct IP back. IE Reports: The security certificate presented by this website was issued for a different website's address. UPDATE 2 http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI The above article touches on some of the key problems with running two SSL servers off of one machine (Mac OSX). However learning something about NameBased SSLVirtualHosts and SNI, I don't think it's the problem I am having, but it might be related. IE is reporting that the server domain and the cert don't match. So I wonder if this is related to me using a global cert for both SSL domains. UPDATE 3 ( solution ) http://serverfault.com/questions/393363/mismatched-address-error-on-self-signed-ssl-certtificate It turns out that the common name for the certificate was wrong, which allowed the certificate to work in FF, and Chrome, but not in IE8, IE9, IE10. After generating a new certificate as a wild card, I was able access all of the NameBased SSL Virtual Hosts via SNI. so set your common name to *.YourDomain.tld and you will be fine.

Set a = Selection
Selection.Cut

ActiveSheet.Paste
 Upon pasting, the ActiveSheet moves to the cell in which its pasting in. How do I re-focus on the cell from which the data was cut? I want to put the focus on the Range that is currently held in the 'A' variable. I tried this: a.Select
 And a.Activate
 but, it doesn't actually move the activeSheet to the correct area; it just selects it.

When my MainUI loads it calls a method called GirdPanel() which sets up my GridPanel. The MainUI, which extends JFrame, then adds this panel to it's JFrame calling. Here is the full code for MainUI that matters for this problem.   public MainUI(){
    setSize(700, 600);

    PathPanel pathPanel = new PathPanel(controller);
    add(pathPanel, BorderLayout.WEST);
    CurrentPath.getInstance().addPathDataListener(pathPanel);
    CurrentPath.getInstance().addPointSelectionListener(pathPanel);

    gridPanel();
    add(gridPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);


    robotControlBar();
    add(robotControls, BorderLayout.NORTH);

    setJMenuBar(menuPanel());
    setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    setVisible(true);
}

public void gridPanel(){
    gridPanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
    WGraph graph = new WGraph();

    gridPanel.add(graph, BorderLayout.CENTER);

}
 The WGraph is my class that extends JPanel and controls the graphing display for this program. public class WGraph extends JPanel{

public WGraph(){
    //WGraph Panel property setup
    setLayout(new BorderLayout());
    //Variable creation
    points = new ArrayList<Dot>();
    //Label to display coordinates of selected point
    pointDisplay = new JLabel("Selected point at: None Chosen");

    //testPoints(); //Comment Out when test dots not needed.

    //Create Graph Panel
    panel = new JPanel();
    panel.setBackground(PANEL_COLOR);

    //Mouse Listeners for Panel
    MouseEventHandler mouseListener = new MouseEventHandler();
    panel.addMouseListener(mouseListener);
    panel.addMouseMotionListener(mouseListener);


    //Adding components to the WGraph panel
    add(pointDisplay, BorderLayout.NORTH);
    add(panel, BorderLayout.CENTER);

    repaint();
}
public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
    // invokes default painting for JFrame; must have this!
    super.paintComponent(g); 

    // paint on the canvas rather than the JFrame
    Graphics pg = panel.getGraphics(); 
    System.out.println("*"); //Print out to see when repaint has been called. for testing only
    int width = panel.getWidth();
    int height = panel.getHeight();
    pg.setColor(GRID_COLOR);

    for (int i = 50; i < width; i+=50) {
        pg.drawLine(i, 0, i, height);
    }

    for (int i = 50; i < width; i+=50) {
        pg.drawLine(0, i, width, i);
    }

    Dot previousPoint = null;

    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
        Dot currentPoint = points.get(i);
        currentPoint.draw(pg);

        if (previousPoint != null) {
            pg.setColor(Dot.DESELECTED_COLOR);
            pg.drawLine(new Float(previousPoint.getCenter().x).intValue(), 
                    new Float(previousPoint.getCenter().y).intValue(), 
                    new Float(currentPoint.getCenter().x).intValue(), 
                    new Float(currentPoint.getCenter().y).intValue());
        }

        previousPoint = currentPoint;
    }
}
 So after all that I can describe my problem. The problem is with the graphing panel it will not show up when expected too. I am trying to determine why. Currently when the program loads it appears like this. LINK1 It simple doesn't show the graph at all but when I drop down the JComboBox it appears. LINK2 It also reamins when the JComboBox has an item selected and closes. LINK3 However it disappears again when you try to interact with it. LINK4 in comments Does anybody see any visible error in my JFrame or JPanel construction? Do you have any suggestions to help me figure out what is going on? Side note: The Paint function is called three times when the frame first loads. Once more when JComboBox opens. Once more when JComboBox closes. And finally more times when trying to ineract with the graph by clicking on it.

@TITLE:Using SharedSingleton to attribute value to NSInteger
@CONTENT:In my viewcontrollerA.h I have: @property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger showCommentOrCreate;
+ (PhotoViewController *) sharedManager;
 in viewcontrollerA.m I use: PhotoViewController* sharedSingleton = [PhotoViewController sharedManager];
...(long)sharedSingleton.showCommentOrCreate...

{
static PhotoViewController *shaderManager = nil;
static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{

});
return shaderManager;
}
 ...to find the value of the integer. In viewcontrollerB I import ViewcontrollerA.h, and in ViewcontorllerB.m, I attribute a value to showCommentOrCreate. The only problem is that it seams I have to assign the value to the integer twice for it to change. e.g: Doesn't work: -(IBAction)addAnImageForCommenting:(id)sender{
PhotoViewController* sharedSingleton = [PhotoViewController sharedManager];
sharedSingleton.showCommentOrCreate = 2;

PhotoViewController* sharedSingleton2 = [PhotoViewController sharedManager];
sharedSingleton2.showCommentOrCreate = 2;

 Doesn't work: -(IBAction)addAnImageForCommenting:(id)sender{

 As you can see I set the value of the integer twice, and it works, otherwise it doesn't. When It doesn't, if i call the code twice with a time interval, the right value is set. Any ideas?? EDIT: Updated the code I claim to work

@TITLE:How do i patch enumerables with Odata.Delta with Webapi
@CONTENT:I?m trying to use System.Web.Http.OData.Delta to implement PATCH methods in ASP.NET Web API services, but it seems unable to apply changes to properties of type IEnumerable. This is my code: public class Person
{
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public IList<Document> AdditionalDocuments { get; set; }

        public HomeAddress HomeAddress { get; set; }
}


public class HomeAddress
{
    public string StreetName { get; set; }
}

public class Document
{
    public string Value { get; set; }
}
 The patch is implemented like this: [AcceptVerbs("PATCH")]
public void Patch(string id, Delta<Person> delta)
{
    var person = personRepository.GetById(id)
    delta.Patch(person);
}
 My problem is that when i patch the informations, the HomeAddress and the AdditionalDocuments are being ignored. I found another article(How do I patch enumerables with System.Web.Http.OData.Delta?) here, but i couldn?t implement the solution because i didn?t know how to internalize the Delta code. May someone help me?

</div></div>

 Now I have the link below which opens the popup fine with no issues: <a href="#popupDialog1"  data-rel="popup" data-position-to="window" data-role="button" data-inline="false" data-transition="pop" data-corners="true" data-shadow="true" data-iconshadow="true" data-wrapperels="span" aria-haspopup="true" data-theme="j" aria-owns="#popupDialog1" class="ui-btn ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all ui-btn-hover-j ui-btn-up-j">
<span class="ui-btn-inner"><span class="ui-btn-text">Approve All</span></span></a>
 However I want to be able to run some code on the click of the above button, I have tried using a LinkButton however I can't get the popup to show.

@TITLE:Excel: Move selection to next blank row in specific column, and enumerate selection by date and type
@CONTENT:New to VBA, so be gentle. I have a 7 columns, A:H. The first column is a unique numerical identifier (starts at 0 and should increase each time I paste a new selection via this macro). The second column is Date which is entered in by hand after being prompted. I want to be able to highlight a range of cells, activate the macro, and the macro move the data highlighted and paste it in next available chunk of space between the C and I columns. At the beginning, the macro prompts a dialog box asks the user for the date. I want this date to be entered at each point along Column B (in the next empty cell) for each cell in the selection. Here are how the columns are formatted now: http://i.imgur.com/7ytAnr9.png Then, for each cell in the selection, I want it to be associated with a numerical ID. So the script would look to see what the last number was in column A, add one to that, and paste that for each cell in the current selection. Here's my code, but as I'm new to this, it's completely broken. For the DialogBox: Sub SuperMacro()

    Dim c As Object
    Dim dateManager As String
    dateManager = InputBox(Prompt:="Enter the Date for Selection", _
          Title:="Date Manager", Default:="1/24/2013")

    If strName = "Your Name here" Or _
        strName = vbNullString Then
        Exit Sub
    End If

    For Each c In Selection
        Range("A1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Select  'Paste the date for each cell in selection
        ActiveSheet.Paste
    Next c

     'Attempt to move all date from selected area to next available chunk of space between C1 and H1.  
     Selection.Copy
     Range("C1:H1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Select
     ActiveSheet.Paste

End Sub
 EDIT: Figured out a solution for the ID enumeration issue and column movement: Sub CopyTest()

    Dim a As Range, b As Range
    Dim value As Integer

    Selection.Copy
    Set a = Selection
    Range("B1:H1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Select
    ActiveSheet.Paste

    value = (Range("A1").End(xlDown)) + 1
    For Each b In a.Rows
        Range("A1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Select
        ActiveCell.value = value
    Next

End Sub
 Let me know if there is a more efficient way of doing this. FOund a solution myself, for others: Sub SuperMacro() Dim a As Range, b As Range
Dim currentID As Integer


Set a = Selection
Selection.Cut Range("C1:I1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0) 'Pastes to appropriate column


currentID = Range("A1").End(xlDown).Value


For Each b In a.Rows
    Range("A1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0) = currentID + 1
    Range("B1").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0) = InputBox("Enter Date", "Date Helper")
Next b
 End Sub
@CODE:Sub SuperMacro()

    Dim c As Object

    dateManager = InputBox(Prompt:="Enter the Date for Selection", _

 I would like to modify the table to be like: Node Name   Temp    NiosVersion HardwareType

.
.
.
 What would be the best way to change to this format? Would I CREATE a VIEW out of the initial query and make a new SELECT FROM WHERE statements? I am not sure how to take a field like ¡§HardwareType¡¨ and make it a column named Hardware Type and place the corresponding STATUS value to a different column. It seems like some sort of conditional is required like CASE. Any ideas to point me in the right direction? Thanks.

 I want to make a dictionary with key = the word (like 'aaien') and the value should be a list of the numbers that are next to it. So it has to look this way: {'aaien': ['12, 13, 39'], 'aan': ['10']} This code doesn't seem to work. document = open('LIWC_words.txt', 'r')
liwcwords = document.read()
dictliwc = {}
for line in liwcwords:
    k, v = line.strip().split(' ')
    answer[k.strip()] = v.strip()

liwcwords.close()

@LINK:/questions/14505615/javascript-show-spinner-save-data-syncronously-remove-spinner
@TITLE:Javascript - Show Spinner, Save Data Syncronously, Remove Spinner
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a javascript plugin that allows you to hook into the save operation. I want some logic wrapped around the logic though: Show a spinner Execute save hook-in Execute save logic Remove Spinner here is an example of my code: function save(){
    var settings = getSettings();

    showSpinner();

    // Hook-in call
    if(settings.onSave)
        settings.onSave();

    saveState();

    removeSpinner();
}
 showSpinner() just hides save/cancel buttons and shows a spinner in its place. hideSpinner() does the opposite. saveState() saves the data from input fields to their data attributes. settings.onSave() can be whatever code is passed in to the config by a user of the plugin. When I run the process the spinner never shows up even though the hook-in I have defined takes ~1.5 seconds to return. If I pause the code in the debugger, the spinner does have a chance to show and it does disappear after the operation is complete. What is the best approach to resolve this? I am not at all familiar with asynchronous design patterns within javascript. I know there is a single thread that the javascript can run on but I don't know why the save operation is getting in the way of showing the spinner.
@CODE:function save(){
    var settings = getSettings();

    showSpinner();

    // Hook-in call
    if(settings.onSave)
        settings.onSave();

    saveState();

    removeSpinner();

@LINK:/questions/14505130/multiple-fragment-to-activity-communication
@TITLE:Multiple Fragment to Activity communication
@CONTENT:here we go again. I am writing an app using fragments. Stefan de Bruijn suggested this would be better than using the deprecated TabHost and he was right, Thank you Stefan. I have finally got communication from one fragment to me Activity working thanks to help from other members (You know who you are, Thank you all). I now have what hopefully is one last problem. My app has TextBox at the top that is part of the Activity, a permanent ListFragment on the left and FrameLayout on the right, to allow different Fragments to be displayed. Is there any way of creating a generic "listener" if you like in the Activity that all the different Fragments can talk to? To get one Fragment passing data I have used the following. MainActivity import com.example.fragger.CoreFragment.OnDataPass;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.widget.EditText;

public class MainActivity extends Activity implements OnDataPass {
 and Fragment Code:- package com.example.fragger;


import android.app.Activity;
import android.app.Fragment;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.RelativeLayout;
import android.view.View.OnClickListener;


public class CoreFragment extends Fragment{

int index;
Button Button1,Button2,Button3;
String Str,data;
OnDataPass dataPasser;

@Override
public void onAttach(Activity a) {
    super.onAttach(a);
        dataPasser = (OnDataPass) a;
}


public static CoreFragment newInstance(int index) {
    CoreFragment coreFragment = new CoreFragment();
    coreFragment.index = index;
    return coreFragment;
}


public interface OnDataPass {
    public void onDataPass(String data);

}
 Which is all well and good until I show a different Fragment in my Frame (e.g. PlaceFragment). As the onDataPass is imported from CoreFragment and implemented, I cannot use it with anything else. Is there any way around this? Thanks all in advance. Gary

@TITLE:Ember route not displaying template content
@CONTENT:I am new to Ember and JS, so far the most extensive tutorials I found were using 1.0.0 pre2, but on the official site there is a very nice description and some examples of 1.0.0 pre4. I started to use that. I am stuck at routing, here is my code: index.html <body>
        Loaded.
        <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="application">
            In template displaying val: {{name}}

            {{#linkTo "index"}}<img class="logo">{{/linkTo}}

            <nav>
              {{#linkTo "about"}}About{{/linkTo}}
              {{#linkTo "favorites"}}Favorites{{/linkTo}}
            </nav>

        </script>

        <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="about">
            Here comes the about text: {{str}}
        </script>
</body>
 app.js window.App = Ember.Application.create();

App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({
templateName: 'application'
})

App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
name: 'test'
})

App.AboutView = Ember.View.extend({
templateName: 'about'
})

App.AboutController = Ember.Controller.extend({
str: 'my string'
})


App.Router.map(function() {
 this.route("about", { path: "/about" });
 this.route("favorites", { path: "/favs" });
});
 It's almost identical to the one from the site. What I want and think should happen, is that it will display the content of about template, but instead it just updates the url's to /#/about or /#/favs . What am I missing here?
@CODE:<body>

@TITLE:3D points projected to form an image
@CONTENT:I want your intellectual suggestions for a problem i have. I have 3D points data along with intensity field (x,y,z,I) which represent the 3D scene. I want this 3D data converted into an image (2D matrix with intensity values 'I'). I plan to do perspective projection of 3D points using pinhole camera model (Wikipedia). x'=f*x/z and y'=f*y/z What value should I select for 'f'? How is the size of image dependent on it? (say I need an image of size 500*500 , what value will suit for 'f') Since coordinates in 2D image are integers, how should I quantize x' and y' values and substitute the corresponding intensity value? E.g. if I get two sets(by using f=10) as x,y,z,I
(3,1,2,128) -> x',y',I(15,5,128)
(3.1,1.1,2,150) -> (15.5,5.5,150)
 Of the above two sets, should i just round off the x' and y' values and use its intensity at that coordinate or should I use an average of intensity of the non-integer coordinates ? Will the resulting image be clearly depicting the scene in 2D (like a photo taken from a camera)? Shall pay much gratitude for your ideas. Thanks
@CODE:(x,y,z,I) 'I' x'=f*x/z y'=f*y/z 'f' 'f' x' y' f=10 x,y,z,I
(3,1,2,128) -> x',y',I(15,5,128)

 Wanted to limit this for the First Section but not on the 2nd section -(NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableview numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    return 5;
}
 So I'm not really sure how to make this dynamic when I try to fill up the cells with this method. I'm not really sure how to make sure it selects the "Key" of the section the specific cell is at (blocked line) : -(UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *) tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *) indexPath {

@TITLE:How to get the value of a label into a textbox with jQuery
@CONTENT:My question is similar to this: How to get textbox value into label using jquery, but I'm trying to do opposite: I'm trying to get the value of a label into a into a textbox. I thought it'd be a simple matter of switching the elements in the code, but that's not the case, apparently. I also did take a look at some of the questions presented in the "Questions that may already have your answer" section below my title, but didn't find something that helped me (maybe the solution was in one of them, but I just didn't understand it...). Here's my table's html: <table id="tblBranchDetails">
    <tr>
        <td width="120px">Branch:</td>
            <td id="branchName" class="branchData">
                <label id="lblBranchName"></label>
                <input type="text" id="txtBranchName" />
            </td>...
 As the author of the post above noted, this doesn't work: $('input#hdnBranchName').val() = $('label#lblBranchName').text();
 I've tried these: $('input#txtBranchName').html($('label#lblBranchName').val());
$('input#txtBranchName').text($('label#lblBranchName').val());
 Neither of those worked. So I tried to see if maybe I wasn't selecting the textbox correctly: $('table#tblBranchDetails input#txtBranchName').html($('label#lblBranchName').val());
$('table#tblBranchDetails input#txtBranchName').text($('label#lblBranchName').val());
 But neither of those worked either. How do I do this, and as a matter of learning more: why doesn't what I would assume to be the obvious method work? Thanks!
@CODE:<table id="tblBranchDetails">
    <tr>
        <td width="120px">Branch:</td>

@LINK:/questions/14500110/codeigniter-activerecord-one-row-at-a-time
@TITLE:CodeIgniter ActiveRecord one row at a time
@CONTENT:I'm running a query that selects many rows. When I loop over the results, I want to fetch a single row at a time (since it's too much memory to fetch them all at once). Problem is, CodeIgniter's Active Record $query->row for all it's variations will fetch all the records from the database into the memory (and return a single row). I looked into the source of DB_result.php and found: public function row_object($n = 0)
{
    $result = $this->result_object();
    if (count($result) == 0)
    {
        return $result;
    }

    if ($n != $this->current_row AND isset($result[$n]))
    {
        $this->current_row = $n;
    }

    return $result[$this->current_row];
}
 and inside result_object(): ...
while ($row = $this->_fetch_assoc())
{
    $this->result_array[] = $row;
}
 This fetches ALL of the records from the database into the memory. Is there a workaround that will allow me to fetch a single row without loading the entire resultset into the memory?
@CODE:public function row_object($n = 0)
{
    $result = $this->result_object();
    if (count($result) == 0)
    {
        return $result;
    }

    if ($n != $this->current_row AND isset($result[$n]))
    {
        $this->current_row = $n;
    }

    return $result[$this->current_row];

 The div is stretched over the page and covers it completely. The situation changes when I open some dialog box on my page. Dialogbox is also absolutely positioned but it's height can be bigger than the initial height of the page. This causes the scrollbars to appear. But the stretched div is not stretching any more! Its height remains the same. In other words, the increase of the scrollable area of the page with javascript due to appearance of new big block is not causing the increase of the height of the element with top:0 and bottom:0. How can I fix it?

@TITLE:AlarmManager Not called next day if the app sleeps for abt 1 day
@CONTENT:I am developing an android app which shows a notification every 12 hour if the time is saved in the database. So everytime a data is entered or edited in the database ,I cancel the current alarmmanager and start a fresh new one so that I dont miss one. Also on reboot I have called the alarmmanager. On the broadcast receiver, the database is checked for entry and if found a notification is set and the app is opened automatically. So when I test the app by changing the date manually,the app works as expected.Also on reboot the app works.But if I keep the app idle for nearly 14 hours,the notification is not set ,but if I open the app and suspend it the notification is set after that. This is how I call the alarmmanager. Intent alarmintent = new Intent(context, package.Alarm_Manager.class);     alarmintent.putExtra("note","Notify");
    sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context , 0 , alarmintent , PendingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT | Intent.FILL_IN_DATA);            
    alarm_manger = (AlarmManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    alarm_manger.cancel(sender);
    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
    long now = cal.getTimeInMillis();
    alarmintent = new Intent(context, package.Alarm_Manager.class);
    alarmintent.putExtra("note","Notification");
    sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context , 0 , alarmintent , PendingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT | Intent.FILL_IN_DATA);            
    alarm_manger = (AlarmManager) context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
    alarm_manger.setRepeating(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, now, AlarmManager.INTERVAL_HALF_DAY, sender);
 This is the broadcast receiver @Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent)
{
       NotificationManager manger = (NotificationManager)context.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
       Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
       date = (int)(cal.getTimeInMillis()/1000);

       notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, "App", "Notify" , contentIntent);
       notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_INSISTENT;
       manger.notify( 0 , notification);
   }

@TITLE:Create Pervasive Database using Distributed Tuning Objects (DTO)
@CONTENT:I am writing an application in C# (.NET 4.0) which has to integrate with another, much older application. Part of the requirement is to integrate with a much older program that uses Pervasive PSQL Version 9. I asked this question about accessing the database without having to install an ODBC DSN. Part of the answer (thanks very much) is that I need to create a database using DTO. I've used COM interop to access the dto2.dll COM library, and have read the samples, but I am having problems creating the database. Here is a summary of the code I'm using. var session = new DtoSession();
var result = session.Connect("localhost", "", "");
Assert.AreEqual(dtoResult.Dto_Success, result);

testDB = new DtoDatabase {
    Session = session,
    Name = "Test1",
    Ddfpath = @"C:\TEMP\DATA\DDF",
    DataPath = @"C:\TEMP\DATA",
};

result = session.Databases.Add(testDB);
Assert.AreEqual(dtoResult.Dto_Success, result);
 No matter what values I use for the Name and paths, that final Assert always fails. The error code is Dto_errDuplicateName. If I do not include the Session property I get a different error code (7039). Has anyone done this successfully? What am I doing wrong?
@CODE:dto2.dll var session = new DtoSession();
var result = session.Connect("localhost", "", "");

@TITLE:php function file_get_contents and first line of UTF-8 encoded text
@CONTENT:I have the following code: $array_test = array();

$file = file_get_contents ('./test.txt');

$file_array = explode("\n", $file);

foreach ($file_array as $line) {

    $word = trim($line);

print_r ($array_test);
 The test.txt is file encoded in UTF-8. It has 5 lines. On each line I have a number: 1 - first line, 2 - second line, etc. The result of running the script is as follows: 1
2
second line
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 4
    [4] => 5
)
 As you can see there's a problem with the first line. It seems that it was added to the array correctly, but somehow its value differs from "1". There's no problems with the other lines, just the first one. The problem can be fixed by skipping the first line and starting to add to the array the values from the second line, but I'm just wondering why it doesn't work the way I wrote it? Usually I don't have any problems with displaying or reading UTF8 encoded texts or pages. Changing to "file" instead of "file_get_contents" doesn't solve the problem. Any suggestion would be very appreciated. p.s. PHP Version 5.3.1 UPDATE: The problem was UTF-8 BOM. See the solution below. Thanks everybody for the help!
@CODE:$array_test = array();

$file = file_get_contents ('./test.txt');

$file_array = explode("\n", $file);

foreach ($file_array as $line) {

    $word = trim($line);
    $array_test[] = $word;
}

echo $array_test[0];

if ($array_test[0] == "1") { echo 'first line'; }

echo $array_test[1];

if ($array_test[1] == "2") { echo 'second line'; }

print_r ($array_test); 1

@TITLE:Breeze Metadata appears in xml format
@CONTENT:Breeze cannot create entities. It does the query for Metadata (which is in my Controller class) and it returns data with a 200 code. Then it queries the data, and returns with a 200 code. Both sets of return data appear to be json format on the surface. Looking further into the Metadata, it appears to be json serializing the xml metadata. This does not feel right to me - and on the live example on the breeze site, does not appear to be doing this. Anyone have any tips on what might be causing this? Here is how the metadata starts: "{\"?xml\":{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"encoding\":\"utf-8\"},\"schema\":{\"namespace\":
 When the service returns data, I get an error, with the full & correct json response. The internalError reports "Unable to get property 'createCtor' of undefined or null reference" It gets to this line in the mergeEntity function, when I debug breeze.js: targetEntity = entityType._createEntityCore();
 Then in the ctr.prototype.getEntityCtor function - it fails to get the entity's constructor from the metadataStore's _typeRegistry property using this line: var aCtor = typeRegistry[this.name] || typeRegistry[this.shortName];
 after that, the error is thrown and we end up in the catch of the executeQuery function.
@CODE:"{\"?xml\":{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"encoding\":\"utf-8\"},\"schema\":{\"namespace\": "Unable to get property 'createCtor' of undefined or null reference" targetEntity = entityType._createEntityCore(); var aCtor = typeRegistry[this.name] || typeRegistry[this.shortName];

@TITLE:VHDL - Incrementing Register Value on Push Button Event
@CONTENT:I am very new to VHDL and am trying to figure out how to do something fairly basic on an Altera Cyclone II. The FPGA has four push buttons - two of them need to be programmed to increase and decrease the selected register (0-F), and the two need to be programmed to increase and decrease the value (from 00 to FF) that will be in that register. Here is what I have so far: entity raminfr is
    port (
        clk : in std_logic;
        we : in std_logic;
        a : in unsigned(3 downto 0);
        di : in unsigned(7 downto 0);
        do : out unsigned(7 downto 0)
    );
end raminfr;

architecture rtl of raminfr is
type ram_type is array (0 to 15) of unsigned(7 downto 0);
signal RAM : ram_type;
signal read_a : unsigned(3 downto 0);

begin

process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        if we = '1' then
            RAM(to_integer(a)) <= di;
        end if;
        read_a <= a;
    end if;
end process;

do <= RAM(to_integer(read_a));

 Could someone provide some basic sample code as to how to go about programming the push buttons?

                       [app openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:newPath]];
                    }


                }

                }

                return NO;

            }
return YES;
}
 the above code works it opens the apps i desire but when I go back to my app from ipad, instead of going to the mainviewcontroller, it reopens the previous opened app. for example if I opened marketboard app, it reopens it when i tap the app icon from ipad home. But the above only happens in ios5.0, it does not happen in 6.0 which is really weird

@TITLE:Retrieve the first OU in search of distinguishedName attribute
@CONTENT:I am using Spring Security 3.1 Active Directory. I have a AD structure, where I need to get an OU value out of the AD structural distinguishedName attribute. The OU that I want, will always be the first OU after the last DC. below is my code example - I need to get the myCompany OU value, there must be a better way to do this: public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) {

    String s = "cn=harry,cn=group,ou=myCompany,ou=customers,dc=this,dc=that";

    System.out.println("s: "+s);

    String s1 = s.substring(s.indexOf("ou=") + 3);

    System.out.println("s1: "+s1);

    String s2 = s1.substring(s1.indexOf(""), s1.indexOf(",ou="));

    System.out.println("s2: "+s2);

}
 } This outputs the following: s: cn=harry,ou=myCompany,ou=customers,dc=this,dc=that 
s1: myCompany,ou=customers,dc=this,dc=that 
s2: myCompany
 Can anyone help please?

@LINK:/questions/14491005/how-to-create-privacy-with-the-use-of-bind
@TITLE:How to create privacy with the use of bind()
@CONTENT:I pass an object literal into a framework method called supportP(). This object literal has a special property called _p which denotes that the members of it are private. From with in the object literal it can be accessed via this._p. However when I pass the object literal into the "outer" scope I do not copy _p. It has now been made private by omission. In order to access _p from public member methods I bind them to the original object using bind() so they still have access to _p via this. Will this work? Are there other things to consider? Wanted some feedback before I tested it out. Below are relevant snippets. /*$A.supportP
**
**
**

$A.supportP = function (o, not_singleton) {
    var oo
        key;
    SupportList[o.Name] = {};
    if (not_singleton) {
        // ignore this section
    } else { // *look here - isFunc returns true if a function
        for (key in o) {
            if ((key !== '_p') && (isFunc(o[key])) {
                oo[key] = o[key].bind(o);
            } else if (key !== '_p') {
                oo[key] = o[key];
            } else {
                // private (_p) - anything to do here?
            }
        }
        return oo;
    }
};

var singleton_object = $A.supportP({
    _p: 'I am private',
    Name: 'test',
    publik_func: function () {
        // this will refer to this object so that it can access _p

@TITLE:Add Google Maps to my app
@CONTENT:I am trying to add google maps to my android application, and I followed this documentation: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start First off, is my Manifest file correct? Manifest.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

    </application>
</manifest>
 Then here is my layout: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              android:layout_width="fill_parent"
              android:layout_height="fill_parent">
    <Button
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="My Location"
        android:onClick="getLocation"

    <fragment xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              class="com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment"/>
</LinearLayout>
 It works fine if I remove the fragment tag, but once I add it back in the app closes and displays: "Unfortunately, MainActivity has stopped." Does anyone see what is wrong?

@TITLE:How do I subclass a UITabbarcontroller using storyboards?
@CONTENT:I have a tabbar application using storyboards. Tab 1 is a UIViewController with Mapview & Tab 2 is a UITableViewController. The appdelegate calls for a web fetch (via a custom class) and takes that web response and pareses it (via a custom class) and then puts the info in a CD-db (via a custom class). MapVC fetches results from the CD-db and populates an NSMutableArray (property) to be looped thru. The array contains a custom CD-db object with 2 coordinates which are used to create an MKAnnotation in the for loop. The distance from each MKAnnotation to userLocation is calculated and the MyLocation Class object is completed with a distance value in its subtitle property. Thus each pin on the map displays a title (name) & subtitle (distance). TableVC creates a separate fetch to the CD-db and populates its array property to be used in the cellForRowAtIndexPath (CFRAIP). Now I want the tableview to also display the distance in each cell. So it has been suggested I subclass the uitabbarcontroller and set the delegate/datasource of the TableVC.tableview to the MapVC. My question is, how do I subclass my uitabbarcontroller and set the delegate and datasource? Something like: in app delegate get the window's rootviewcontroller?

@LINK:/questions/14490556/disable-webform-button-after-validation-and-before-postback
@TITLE:Disable Webform button after validation and before postback
@CONTENT:Using WebForms, how can I have a button, which is disabled, after only IT has been clicked, and also AFTER validation has been passed? I know there is: Disable asp.net button after click to prevent double clicking However, there are other postbacks on my page, before the final button press which confirms the booking, and I need these to be allowed. It's only the final button press that I need to ensure passes validation, but only allows one press, before being disabled. Code is as follows:    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!Page.IsPostBack)
    {
        FinalButton.Attributes.Add("onclientclick", "if(Page_ClientValidate('vg')){this.disabled = true; }");
    }

}
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    TextBox1.Text = "Hi";
}
protected void Button3_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    TextBox1.Text = "";
}
 ASPX page:  <p>
    <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox1" runat="server" ValidationGroup="vg"></asp:TextBox>
</p>
<p>
    <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" OnClick="Button1_Click" Text="Set TextBox1 to Hi" />
    <asp:Button ID="Button3" runat="server" OnClick="Button3_Click" Text="Set TextBox1 to Empty" />
</p>
<p>
    <asp:Button ID="FinalButton" runat="server" Text="Final Submit" ValidationGroup="vg" />
    <asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID="RequiredFieldValidator1" runat="server" ControlToValidate="TextBox1" ErrorMessage="RequiredFieldValidator" ValidationGroup="vg"></asp:RequiredFieldValidator>
</p>
 So, the unless the textbox is populated, the "FinalButton" should not submit (this part works). However, if the textbox is populated, then it should be disabled to prevent double clicks, before posting back - but it doesn't disable, so I presume my code here, is not correct: FinalButton.Attributes.Add("onclientclick", "if(Page_ClientValidate('vg')){this.disabled = true; }");
 The source on the page when it is rendered, shows the button as: <input type="submit" name="ctl00$MainContent$FinalButton" value="Final Submit" onclick="javascript:WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions(new WebForm_PostBackOptions(&quot;ctl00$MainContent$FinalButton&quot;, &quot;&quot;, true, &quot;vg&quot;, &quot;&quot;, false, false))" id="MainContent_FinalButton" onclientclick="if(Page_ClientValidate(&#39;vg&#39;)){this.disabled = true; }" />
 Thank you, Mark

@TITLE:Fusion table query : zoom on a marker from an external link
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create links from a text to a marker in a google fusion map. More precisely, I want the map to refresh and zoom on the location selected. A picture will be easier to understand: http://projeteurope.free.fr/ For example, if you click on "Akrame" on the right side of the page, the map should zoom on the point (which already exist in the fusion table, and is 19 Rue Lauriston, 75016 Paris) I've look at different topics and websites, but I don't understand how to do that (I'm a total beginner in javascript) Fusion Table + Google Maps or http://alamatku.com/cari?query=UPS&area=jakarta or Google Fusion Tables With Maps - Link Table field to Map Info Window I just want the map to zoom on a specific market, not to create a new layer with only the marker. Many thanks if you have any clues! Robin

@TITLE:Starting the android zxing scanner via web app doesn't seem to work
@CONTENT:My starting point for scanning from a web app was this article here Then i realized it was as simple as clicking a link like this http://zxing.appspot.com/scan?req=http%3A%2F%2FLOCAL_SERVER_NAME%2FMY_APP_NAME%2FMY_SERVLET%3Fcode%3D%7BCODE%7D
 but it didn't work. My web app is simple like this (using ajax from jquery) $("#onebutton").click(function(){
        $.ajax({
            url: "http://zxing.appspot.com/scan",
            success:function(){
                alert("success");
            },
            error:function(){
                alert("error");
            },
            data:{
                req:"http%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.100:8080%2FMY_APP_NAME%2FMY_SERVLET%3Fcode%3D%7BCODE%7D"
            }

        });
    });
 needless to say that "#onebutton" is a button tag with that id. When Pressing such button on a browser in android it always alerts the error message. It doesn't ask for the scanner to start up. When i click the button in a normal PC, the console says: "Origin http://192.168.1.100:8080 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin".
 Am i doing something wrong?. Am i missing something? Thank you all in advance!!

@TITLE:Double foreign key generation
@CONTENT:This is a followup-question of this question, where i had a similar problem. But this is solved now by default foreign key convention. My problem now is (in short), that my migrations generates int ReferencedEntityID; int ReferencedEntity_ReferencedEntityID; where one is an integer property in my model and the other one is a virtual property. My migrations generates this: "dbo.Contracts",
            c => new
                {
                    ContractId = c.Int(nullable: false, identity: true),
                    PricePerUnit = c.Double(nullable: false),
                    Unit = c.Int(nullable: false),
                    Currency = c.Int(nullable: false),
                    ClientId = c.Int(nullable: false),
                    CompanyId = c.Int(nullable: false),

                    Article_ArticleId = c.Int(),

@TITLE:Using cronjob and email to create a texting ¡§server¡¨
@CONTENT:So the idea of this was to create a "server" that would work by reading my email and looking for certain key headers in the email. When an email with a certain header is detected, the commands in it are interpreted and run. These are not Linux commands mind you, just different commands I have made available. Let me give you an example: I send from my phone the text "Computer, define Hello" to my email. My email receives the text, and saves it as "Computer, define Hello". My computer downloads my newest email and sees "Computer, define Hello", and runs the command "define Hello". It sends the results of sending the command back to me, which would be the definition of the word "Hello". The code actually works fine on its own, and almost works fine on cronjob. In fact, the only command that's having a problem is the command "sendmail" which is what sends the mail back to my phone. I saw that people have talked about using "MAILTO" to send email. I'm not using MAILTO but am instead using a combination of gmail, mailx, and msmpta to get the job done. sendmail works normally, just not through cronjob for some reason. Here is the page where I got instructions on how to do this: http://tuxtweaks.com/2012/10/send-gmail-from-the-linux-command-line/ Any ideas?

@TITLE:Making data templated in available to ng-model
@CONTENT:When using server-side templating and client-side angularjs, I'm not able to get angularjs to recognize values I've templated in on the server. For example (or on jsfiddle): <div ng-app>
<div ng-controller="Ctrl">
    <textarea ng-model="data" placeholder="Enter a name here">Templated in</textarea>
    {{data}}
</div>
</div>
 Angularjs will always replace the value in the text area with the value of $scope.data (which is null). What I want is for the value of $scope.data to take on "Templated in", on app bootstrap, then to continue normally from there. How can I template in from the server a value, then have angularjs model bind that value once on the client?
@CODE:<div ng-app>
<div ng-controller="Ctrl">
    <textarea ng-model="data" placeholder="Enter a name here">Templated in</textarea>

@TITLE:PHP not recognizing MySQL installation
@CONTENT:Fellas, I have wasted about 4 hours of my life on this and now I am coming to you. I realize this has been asked before, but I have extensively read similar questions and still cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. I installed PHP 5.2.17 and Apache 2.2 using this source: http://www.thesitewizard.com/php/install-mysql-windows-vista.shtml The installations worked just great and I have been using them to work on my computer. I recently decided I wanted to try to add MySQL as well. I used the same source (which is the link above) to install MySQL. I installed the latest version of MySQL (5.5) and everything seems to have gone smoothly in regards to installing it on my computer. In my PHP.ini file, the following are set and not commented out: extension_dir = "c:\php\ext"
extension=php_mysql.dll
extension=php_mysqli.dll
 The PHP folder is in the correct place, and I have looked and seen that the .dll files do exist in the "ext" directory. I have both restarted both Apache and my computer since making all of the above changes. phpMyAdmin gives me this error: "The mysqli extension is missing. Please check your PHP configuration." and the function phpinfo(), when called in a test.php page, is not recognizing the MySQL extensions (to verify it is working with PHP) as my source tutorial site said it would. In addition, I added this ";c:\php" to my system variables under Path as instructed by my tutorial site. Again, I restarted the computer after all of this was done. Have restarted Apache many times. MySQL is allowed in the correct port. Any thoughts? Thanks for your time, I highly appreciate it. EDIT: just in case it makes any difference, I installed in MySQL without a password because it was saying my root password was wrong or something, so I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it without the password and the installation went all the waythrough.

Using Windows 8, terminal is set to codepage 65001, using 'Lucida Console' fonts. Code snippet won't be of too much help, I guess: def display_resource():

@TITLE:Facebook App Permission Getting Toggled Somehow
@CONTENT:I have Facebook's SSO working properly in my iPhone app and most of my users have not been experiencing any issues. However, a small number of them have been reporting errors with Facebook Connect and not being able to create an account. After an email exchange with one, we determined that the app permission toggle under Settings->Facebook was somehow set to disallow my app from using Facebook. I have since added an error message telling the user this might be the case but my question is how did this switch get toggled in the first place? It would seem that a user would have to manually toggle this switch, right? I also looked for an API method that might do this e.g. rejecting Facebook SSO the first time a user saw the dialog asking for permission; I could not find any such code. Any ideas? I'm hoping this problem will solve itself with the error dialog I've put in but if possible, I'd like to remove this issue altogether.

How would I just create one instance of the code, then refer to it later on? - when I need that code, instead of just copy and pasting massive lines of code each time. In this block of code, I am getting a random number between 1 to 10 this number will be stored in RI... then when it's Ai's turn the computer will randomly input an X in the button, then using this code it will check to determine if the computer has won. I hope that make sense =) do
{
    storeRI = rc.Next(0, 10); //storing random number into storeRI so it can be used later on in life. 
    if (storeRI == 1 && btn1.Text == "")

@TITLE:php mod rewrite .htaccess ignore directory
@CONTENT:What rule should i set, to make the mod_rewrite ignore the directory "public" completely? By that, I mean, the files should be accessible within it, but if the file does not exist, a server error page should come up with something like, FORBIDDEN, or FILE NOT FOUND what ever. I do not need custom error pages or stuff like that. I simply want the "public" to behave like there is no mod_rewrite at all. Here is my .htaccess file: RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|robots\.txt)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L,QSA]
 My file structure is /system/
/application/
/public/
 I want the folder public to behave, like there are no rewrite rules set at all, completely ignore it. edit That's my .htaccess file: RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule ^(public)($|/) - [L,NC]

RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|robots\.txt)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L,QSA]
 I already had this .htaccess in the /public/ folder: RewriteEngine off
 I've tried all the different answers above (and a ton from google). I've tried to mix 'em up what so ever. My folders: /system/
/application/
/public/ 
/public/.htaccess #RewriteEngine off
/public/favicon.ico
/index.php
 Below are the url with results I'm getting: /public/favicon.ico -> I get the favicon
/public/faviDon.ico -> I get the index.php (without mod rewrite you would get "not found")
/public/ -> I get the index.php (without mod rewrite "forbidden")
 So it still does rewrite urls, if the file was not found, or upon accessing a folder directly. Can you se it? Thank you very much for effort guys! I really appreciate it!
@CODE:RewriteEngine on

@TITLE:Generate high contrast random color using PHP
@CONTENT:I need to generate random colors for all the users in the system. The trick is that 2 users cant have very similar colors, they need to be distinguishable. I have the code to generate random colors given the original mix color but cant find a way to generate random colors with high contrast using only PHP public static function generateRandomColor($rgb)
{
    $red = rand(1, 256);
    $green = rand(1, 256);
    $blue = rand(1, 256);

    if (! empty($rgb))
    {
        $red = ($red + $rgb['red']) / 2;
        $green = ($green + $rgb['green']) / 2;
        $blue = ($blue + $rgb['blue']) / 2;
    }

    $color = "rgb({$red}, {$green}, {$blue})";

    return $color;
}
 and then i have a loop: $colorsArr = array();
$mixed = array('red' => 255, 'green' => 255, 'blue' => 255);
for($i = 0; $i < count($users); $i++)
{
    $color = generateRandomColor($mixed);

    $colorsArr .= '<div style="width:25px; height: 25px; background-color: ' . $color . '"></div>';
}
 now this generates colors but some colors look like each other. The goal is to have an unique color for each user. any help appreciated thanks. NOTE: i do not want to hardcode the colors for 500 users
@CODE:public static function generateRandomColor($rgb)
{
    $red = rand(1, 256);

@TITLE:Delphi overwrite file and wrong modified date time
@CONTENT:I'd like to get a file last modified time in Delphi. Normally something like FileAge() would do the trick, only the problem is: if I overwrite *File A* with File B using CopyFile, File A's modified date is not updated with current overwrite time as it should(?) I get that: CopyFile also copy file attributes, but I really need to get the modified date that also works when a file is overwritten. Is there such function? My whole application relies on modification time to decide whether or not I should proceed with files! EDIT Just to clarify: I'm only monitoring the files. It's not my application who's modifying them.

@CONTENT:I slimmed down my actual code but I can't get this work. I am using knockoutjs and bootstrap with inline knockout templates. I use to just put a bunch of input's inside a div but I changed it to a table for alignment reasons. I know the property names are correct and the javascript console doesn't show any errors at all for bad variables or binding issues. I am putting the foreach in a TR tag instead of the TBODY tag because I don't know how many checkboxes I will have every time and I don't want them in rows exactly, just one TR element and a bunch of TD cells inside that one TR tag for now. How can I make this work?? <div id="Counties" class="well well-large checkbox inline">

    var self = this;
    self.counties = ko.observableArray([]); //array of jurisItem
}

function jurisItem(name, sid) {
    var self = this;
    self.name = name;
    self.sid = sid;
}
 Edit : I also tried this based on knockoutjs documentation and it doesn't work. I know I can do this in other ways using jquery but I would prefer knockout template syntax... <table class="table table-condensed">

@TITLE:Javascript code help - Wrong return
@CONTENT:So I'm working on this script. When I'm done with it, it should be used for making 2-and-2 groups. But anyway; The 'input' array in the start of the script, will get 22 different inputs from my HTML file. As a standard, I gave them the values 1-22. The thing is my two blocks '1st number' and '2nd number' doesn't work very well: they don't return the right numbers. Cause I want every elev[x] to be used once! Not 2 times, not 0 times, once! And the blocks returns like some of them twice and some of them isn't even used. So how can I fix this?     function Calculate(){
    var elev = [];
    var inputs = document.getElementsByName("txt");
    for(i=0; i<inputs.length; i++) {
    elev[i] = {
        "Value": inputs[i].value,
        "Used": false
    };
}

    function shuffle(elev){
    var len = elev.length;
    for(i=1; i<len; i++){
        j = ~~(Math.random()*(i+1)); 
        var temp = elev[i];
        arr[i] = elev[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }

    for(var v=0; v<1; v++) {
        shuffle(elev);
        document.write(elev + '<br/>\n');
    }}
 Yes, I'm still new at programming and I just wanna learn what I can learn. Problem solved by doing the Fisher-Yates shuffle.

    var elev = [];

@TITLE:cakephp lot of queries inside a query
@CONTENT:I have a site developed in cakephp 2.x I have a query with contain with a very lot of table relationed. I know that the most efficient way to do this big query is to make the join query manually. But I wanted to try with contain. I have selected only the field that I need but at the end I print how much queries inside are created: 5000 queries!! The database take 6-10 second to elaborate this query and I want to optimize time. Has cakephp a method to optimize? I don't want to use join now because there are a lot of join to create. Is possible? I know that is a crazy query with a lot of data but is the main page of the product with a lot of data. This is the query: $this->set('product',$this->Product->find('all', array(

@LINK:/questions/14486954/wcf-call-that-references-windows-service
@TITLE:WCF call that references Windows Service
@CONTENT:I have a long-running service that gets data from one source, manipulates it, stores it in a database, etc. I'd like to expose some methods on that service to other applications. Currently we do this via .NET Remoting but I'd like to move to WCF. Unfortunately, I the endpoint I connect to is never the one I exposed via my long-running service. Below is a simple example:     [ServiceContract]
    public interface ITestWcfService
    {
        [OperationContract]
        CounterResult GetCurrentValue();
    }

public class TestWcfService : ITestWcfService
    {
        private ITestWindowsService _service;
        public TestWcfService() { /*NOTE: For discoverability*/ }
        public TestWcfService(ITestWindowsService service)
        {
            _service = service;
        }

        public CounterResult GetCurrentValue()
        {
            return _service.GetCurrentValue();
        }
    }

public interface ITestWindowsService
    {
        CounterResult GetCurrentValue();
    }
 Then I have my actual Windows Service, which self-hosts the WCF service via the ServiceHost class. public partial class TestWindowsService : ServiceBase, ITestWindowsService
{
    private static ServiceHost _wcfService;

    public TestWindowsService()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    public void OnStart(string[] args)
    {
        //Create instance of WCF, passing in reference to this service instance
        TestWcfService wcf = new TestWcfService(this);
        _wcfService = new ServiceHost(wcf);
    }

        public CounterResult GetCurrentValue()
    {
        //Note: Some logic here
    }
}
 Now, this more-or-less works except that each time I make a call to the TestWcfServiceClient(), it uses the default constructor and creates a new instance of the Wcf Service and does not use the instance created by the windows service. This means that when I call GetCurrentValue() I get a null reference because the _service member hasn't been set. I've looked around for solutions and found some citing ServiceHostFactory and ServiceHost and IInstanceProvider but each has seemed to be very, very complicated. Any thoughts you could provide would be most appreciated. EDIT: Here's my ServiceModel info <system.serviceModel>

 If I change the output format to an mp4, mov, or f4v by changing: // setup mux (FLV OUTPUT)

    printf("Could not guess format.\n");

 Then the bitrate is honored. Here is the output of running with a mp4 output Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'input_file.mp4':

 I noticed that the bitrate is honored as long as the container is a mp4, mov, f4v, or something similar. If I try flv, wmv, or other different containers, then the bitrate is not honored. Also, the bitrate that is automatically set for wmv is different from that of flv. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I suspect it has to do with the pts, however, I cannot find a solution :(.

@LINK:/questions/14485585/how-does-this-reversestring-algorithm-work
@TITLE:How does this reverseString algorithm work?
@CONTENT:I have seen this algorithm to reverse a string online, and I have some doubts about it which I will specify at the end of the code:     void reverseString(char *original_string)
    {
        char *end = original_string;
        char tmp;

        if(original_string) {
            while(*end) {
                ++end;
            }
            --end;
            while (original_string < end) {
                tmp = *original_string;
                *original_string++ = *end;
                *end-- = tmp;
            }
        }
//This line doesn't have the complete reversed string. Why?
printf("%s\n", original_string);
    }
 1) In the while loop...Why do we compare two pointers? How do we know that the value is going to be bigger or smaller?? Those are just pointers, right? 2) Why don't we return anything? Where is the reversed string? If we are impyling that the reversed string is in the original_string, shouldn't we have used a pointer to pointer so that the effects are in the outter scope? 3) If I do the following: char test[] = "hello";
    reverseString(test);
    printf("%s\n", test);
 I can see the "olleh". However, if I do printf("%s\n", original_string); at the very last line of the function reverseString, I just get "leh". Why is that?
@CODE:void reverseString(char *original_string)
    {
        char *end = original_string;
        char tmp;

        if(original_string) {

    } char test[] = "hello";

@TITLE:asyncore.loop doesn't terminate when there are no more connections
@CONTENT:I am following some example code to use asyncore here, only having set a timeout value for asyncore.loop as in the following full example: import smtpd
import asyncore

class CustomSMTPServer(smtpd.SMTPServer):

    def process_message(self, peer, mailfrom, rcpttos, data):
        print 'Receiving message from:', peer
        print 'Message addressed from:', mailfrom
        print 'Message addressed to  :', rcpttos
        print 'Message length        :', len(data)
        return

server = CustomSMTPServer(('127.0.0.1', 1025), None)

asyncore.loop(timeout = 1)
 I have expected that a timeout occurs after 1 second, but this is not the case. The code runs much longer for than one second. What am I missing here?

@LINK:/questions/14485225/menu-wrap-every-x-item
@TITLE:Menu: wrap every X item
@CONTENT:I am trying to wrap every 3rd item in a menu generated with TypoScript. This is my menu: tt_content.menu.20.4 >
tt_content.menu.20.4 < tt_content.menu.20.1
tt_content.menu.20.4.stdWrap.outerWrap = <div class="my-menu">|</div>
tt_content.menu.20.4.1.wrap = <ul>|</ul>
tt_content.menu.20.4.1.NO {
    doNotLinkIt = 1
    stdWrap.htmlSpecialChars = 0
    stdWrap.cObject = COA
    stdWrap.cObject {
        # title
        10 = TEXT
        10 {
            field = title
            typolink.parameter.field = uid
            typolink.ATagParams = class="more"
        }

        # abstract
        20 = TEXT
        20 {

            htmlSpecialChars = 1
            wrap = <span>|</span>
        }
    }
}
 Via How can I apply a different wrap to every menu item? I know how to wrap every item different, is there a way to wrap three items together? And when there are more than 3 % x = 0 items, e.g. 14, the last opening tag has to be closed with the last item. Current output: <ul class="csc-menu csc-menu-1">
    <li>
        <a href="index.php?id=1">Page 1</a>
    </li>

@TITLE:Spring security authorization via GET parameters
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get Spring Security to handle authorization via GET variables. All the examples I've been able to find focus pretty much entirely on role-based authorization, which doesn't really work for my application. The way the authentication/authorization process needs to work is as follows: User authenticates through external system, gets a session ID. User passes two GET parameters to my application, sessionId and objectId. Application verifies that session is valid (already figured this part out) Application verifies that the object is visible to the user (need help here) Application returns object information to the user All the examples I've seen have been demonstrating how powerfully Spring Security can check a granted authority on a URL pattern or a Java method. But I need to implement a custom check on step 4 to make sure that the user has the correct permissions in the backend (users can be granted object-specific rights, so a role approach won't work here). I am new to Spring Security, so it could be that my thought process is just all sorts of wrong. If I am, feel free to correct me!

 Am I missing something, or are blocks just not supported by the UIGestureRecognizer class?

@LINK:/questions/14484739/how-can-i-enforce-cuda-global-memory-coherence-without-declaring-pointer-as-vola
@TITLE:How can I enforce CUDA global memory coherence without declaring pointer as volatile?
@CONTENT:I'll first do some contextualization. I'm trying to implement a non-blocking work stealing method using deques in CUDA. The deques (aDeques) are in a block-segmented array in global memory and the popWork() device function has the objective of popping work to feed threads. In addition of the global deques, each block has a stack in shared memory (aLocalStack) where it can locally work. The pop occurs in 3 levels. First attempt is in the shared stack, second attempt is in the deque owned by the block and third attempt is work steal other deques. Each deque has global bottom and pop pointers that lie in a global memory arrays (aiDequesBottoms and auiDequesAges). My problem is that when a block changes a global deque pointer, the changes aaren't being visible by other blocks when I test code in a GTS450. It seems like cache is not being updated. I have also tested in a GT520 card, where the problem does not occur. I have experienced similar problems with the aiDequeFlags array. These problems are solved by declaring it volatile. Unfortunatelly, I can't do the same to the deque pointer arrays, since I need to use atomic functions on them later. I'm sorry to not put the problem in a simpler example, but I couldn't reproduce this behavior. This first snippet has the popWork() interface explained . template <int iDequeSize> //Size of each segment in aDeques 
bool __inline__ __device__ popWork(
    volatile int *aiDequeFlags , //Flags that indicates if a deque is active (has work)
    int *aiDequesBottoms , //Deque bottom pointers
    unsigned int *auiDequesAges , //Deque top pointers (29 higher bits) + 
                                  //Tag bits(3 lower bits).
    const Int2Array *aDeques , //Deques (Int2Array is an interface for 2 int arrays)
    int &uiStackBot , //Shared memory stack pointer
    int2 *aLocalStack , //Shared memory local stack
    const int &iTid , //threadIdx.x
    const int &iBid , //blockIdx.x

    //All other parameters are output

unsigned int &uiPopDequeIdx , //Choosen deque for pop
    int2 *popStartIdxAndSize , //Arrays of pop start index and sizes
    bool *bPopFlag , //Array of flags for pop in each level
unsigned int &uiActiveDequesIdx , //Flag to indicate pop failed (no more work)
    int2 &work //Actual acquired thread work)
 This second snippet has the entire function. The kernel that uses the function was launched with 8 blocks, 64 threads and in the beginning just deque 0 has 1 work, while all other deques are empty. There are some debug printf calls to generate a log, which will be show in the next snippet. template <int iDequeSize>

 } This last snippet is the generated log. The push lines ("Block X push. Bottom=Y") were generated by a push function which was not showed here. Remember that in the beginning, just block 0 has 1 work. Block 0 pop global deque. Bottom=0

 As can be seen, only block 4 can see the changes in block 0 deque bottom pointer. I tried adding some __threadfence() calls after any change in the pointers but no sucess. Thanks for the attention!

@TITLE:Change the TextBlock Foreground from ComboBox over Event fire only in a Style.xaml
@CONTENT:I have a Style xaml without a .cs File Below you can find a part of my code. There you can find the TextBlock. I would like to change the fontcolor there when the user takes an action (hover, click, whatever). As you can see there is the VisualStateManager who deals with the events of the Combobox. Is it possible to overwrite the foreground in the Visual state manager (for example: If "click" then red, if "hover" then blue)? I've spent many time to find a solution for my problem but there is no solution in view... Can anybody help my? Attention the solution is only in a xaml file implemented that holds all styles from my controls. <Border x:Name="ContentPresenterBorder"

@TITLE:gSOAP empty answer
@CONTENT:I'm writing a SOAP client. I'm using gSOAP version 2.7.17 and I have to stick to that version as the server is using this one and I cannot modify it as it is already running in the field. When I do my SOAP call, I always receive empty answer! However, when I sniff the network, the XML answer seems correct: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
    xmlns:SOAP-ENC="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

            <dDetail>cBla</dDetail>
        </unitCallResponse>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
 Here is a simplified code snippet about how I perform the SOAP call with the proxy generated with soapcpp2: UMSLogin::unitCallResponse response;    // Response from SOAP
UMSLogin::UMSLoginProxy* m_soapProxy =  // The SOAP proxy
    new UMSLogin::UMSLoginProxy(SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE, SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE);

callRes = m_soapProxy->unitCall(m_eUnitType, serial, m_dInterfaceVersion,
    xl2CallTypeToUmsLoginCallType(m_pSoapEndPoint->getCallType()),
    xl2CommTypeToUmsLoginCommType(m_pSoapEndPoint->getComType()),
    response);

logDebug(LOG_COM_DEVICE, "SOAP call done to %s, SOAP code %i, central code %i",
    response.szServerName.c_str(), callRes, response.dResponse);

m_soapProxy->soap_close_socket();
m_soapProxy->destroy();
delete m_soapProxy;
 The actual output: SOAP call done to , SOAP code 0, central code 0
 When I expect SOAP call done to UMS_DEV_LANCC2 (2), SOAP code 0, central code 5
/* 5 ->  cUNITRETURNCODE_RESTARTIMMEDIATE */
 There was an old implementation that was working previously, this must be working! Where am I wrong? Did anyone has already had this kind of problem? Any pointer is strongly appreciated! EDIT: Problem was "solved" by using an earlier version of SOAP (2.7.14) without changing a single line of code from the original version of my program. However, I have the feeling I miss something important again! I should probably tweak a little my header file giving the SOAP "definitions" to make things working ...

@LINK:/questions/14484134/set-current-state-in-odeint
@TITLE:Set current state in odeint
@CONTENT:I would like to set the current_state of a stepper in boost::odeint. I have the following MWE: #include <queue>
#include <boost/numeric/odeint.hpp>
#include <array>

typedef std::array< double , 2 > state_type;

void eqsys(const state_type &x, state_type &dxdt, double t) {
    dxdt[0] = 0.3*x[1];
    dxdt[1] = 4*x[0];
}

int main() {
    int steps=0;
    auto stepper=make_dense_output(1.0e-6,1.0e-6,boost::numeric::odeint::runge_kutta_dopri5< state_type >() );
    state_type x={2,2};
    double stoptime=10;

    stepper.initialize(x,0,0.01);

    while(true){
        //Run stepper
        while( stepper.current_time()<stoptime && steps<10000 ) {
            stepper.do_step(eqsys);
            ++steps;
        }
        x=stepper.current_state();
        x[0]=2;
        stepper.set_current_state(x);
        stoptime+=10;
    }
}
 The line stepper.set_current_state(x); is the one that doesn't work. Is there a command I can use to accomplish this? I realize I could probably just use: stepper.initialize(x, stepper.current_time(), 0.01);
 but's it's unclear if this is really the best strategy, or if I'm losing some internal state of the stepper (such as the current stepsize or error estimate) which it would be better to keep.
@CODE:current_state #include <queue>
#include <boost/numeric/odeint.hpp>

    dxdt[0] = 0.3*x[1];
    dxdt[1] = 4*x[0];
}

int main() {
    int steps=0;
    auto stepper=make_dense_output(1.0e-6,1.0e-6,boost::numeric::odeint::runge_kutta_dopri5< state_type >() );
    state_type x={2,2};
    double stoptime=10;

    stepper.initialize(x,0,0.01);

    while(true){
        //Run stepper
        while( stepper.current_time()<stoptime && steps<10000 ) {
            stepper.do_step(eqsys);
            ++steps;
        }
        x=stepper.current_state();
        x[0]=2;
        stepper.set_current_state(x);
        stoptime+=10;
    }
} stepper.set_current_state(x); stepper.initialize(x, stepper.current_time(), 0.01);

@CONTENT:I cannot for the life of me get binding to work with PDO queries, they always return false. On this example, it checks that the value of a field is between 2 other values. This works: $query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM table WHERE field1 > '$start' AND field1 < '$finish'");
 This doesn't: $query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM table WHERE field1 > :start AND field1 < :finish");
$query->bindParam(":start", $start);
$query->bindParam(":finish", $finish);
 UPDATE: The above query now works thanks to the help. The following still doesn't. I have been trawling through various PDO posts on here but I have not found a solution, and I don't know what else to try. UPDATE2: Okay, it seems it is not finding $db and therefore not connecting and returning false. The $db connection line is in a connect.php file that is required on all main pages. The content on those pages is called by a function that then includes the relevant file/page. Because PDO does not work by itself in functions, is it losing the $db through the function to include the file containing the query? I may not have explained myself clearly enough. Basically, example function in functions.php: function getRegistration() {
    include("registration.php");
}
 main.php require_once("connect.php");
require_once("functions.php");

getRegistration();
 registration.php contains: $sql = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO tempus_members(username, email, password, activation_code, registration_date, registered_ip, name) VALUES(:username, :email, :password, :activation_code, :registration_date, :registered_ip, :name)");
$sql->bindParam(":username", $username);
$sql->bindParam(":email", $email);
$sql->bindParam(":password", $hash);
$sql->bindParam(":activation_code", $activation_code);
$sql->bindParam(":registration_date", $registration_date);
$sql->bindParam(":registered_ip", $registered_ip);
$sql->bindParam(":name", $name);
$sql->execute();
 Is it losing the $db variable through the function to include the page? If so, how do I carry $db through all functions?
@CODE:$query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM table WHERE field1 > '$start' AND field1 < '$finish'"); $query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM table WHERE field1 > :start AND field1 < :finish");
$query->bindParam(":start", $start);
$query->bindParam(":finish", $finish); function getRegistration() {
    include("registration.php");
} require_once("connect.php");
require_once("functions.php");

getRegistration(); $sql = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO tempus_members(username, email, password, activation_code, registration_date, registered_ip, name) VALUES(:username, :email, :password, :activation_code, :registration_date, :registered_ip, :name)");
$sql->bindParam(":username", $username);
$sql->bindParam(":email", $email);
$sql->bindParam(":password", $hash);
$sql->bindParam(":activation_code", $activation_code);
$sql->bindParam(":registration_date", $registration_date);
$sql->bindParam(":registered_ip", $registered_ip);
$sql->bindParam(":name", $name);
$sql->execute();

@LINK:/questions/14483426/unable-to-retrieve-a-sub-nodelist-from-a-nodelist-in-javascript
@TITLE:Unable to retrieve a sub-NodeList from a NodeList in Javascript
@CONTENT:So here's the deal: I'm trying to retrieve a NodeList object from an already existing NodeList. Here's a simplified XML example: <products>
  <category>
  <name>Category A</name>
    <product>
      <code>1</code>
      <name>Product 1 Category A</name>
      <price>10.0</price>
    </product>
    <product>
      <code>2</code>
      <name>Product 2 Category A</name>
      <price>20.0</price>
    </product>
  </category>
  <category>
  <name>Category B</name>
    <product>
      <code>3</code>
      <name>Product 1 Category B</name>
      <price>5.0</price>
    </product>
    ...
  </category>
</products>
 As you can see, the tag name appears twice, once as a child node of category and again as a child node of product. I wish to retrieve only product names. Since I can't read from the XML file but rather receiving it as a string, here's my parse function: function parseXML(xmlString) {
    var parser = new DOMParser();
    var xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(xmlString, "text/xml");
    var products = xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("product");
    var names = products.tags("name"); //Here's my problem
    for(var i = 0; i < names.length; i++){
        var element = names[i];
        var name = element.firstChild;
        $('#div_products').append(name.data + "<br>");  
    }
    $('#div_main').html($('#div_products').html());
}       
 This is what I'm using as reference: http://help.dottoro.com/ljtrjxbf.php. Using nodeListObject.tags("tag"), however, will produce the following error: processMessage failed: Stack: TypeError: Object #<a NodeList> has no method 'tags'
 I've trying different approaches, but nothing worked. Even var names = products["name"];
 returns "undefined", which wouldn't work for me in any case, since the documentation says that aside from IE, it will return only the first node and A) I'm working with Android/Cordova and B) There's no attribute "name" in the node anyway. So how do I work this out? I supposed I could try to create a new XMLDocument object from the products NodeList but I haven't looked into it since it must have a more trivial way to solve this problem.
@CODE:<products>
  <category>
  <name>Category A</name>

 The problem is that there are a lot of values with extra double quotes in it. This can be 1 double quote, but also 2 or 3 extra double quotes. See the value of "documentation.title" in my example. How do i find all these quotes and replace them with regular expression. I use sublime text 2 to do my regular expression, but i don't know how to solve this specific problem.

@TITLE:How to avoid different letters cases (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) in search mode - Android
@CONTENT:I'm building an app that should replace the default contacts phone book, and I want to add a search bar for search a contact's name. For now I have all the contacts in my own DB and a TextWatcher for keep tracking any change in the editText - then builds a query with the char sequence that the user entered. This is works fine, I'm getting all the contacts the user search like all the contacts starts with "a". Now I want to add a new functionality to ignore special letters like: ?, ?, ?, ?, ?. I want that the user could type a and still get all the contacts that starts with ? the same for e and all the other letters. Is there a way to do this in the query itself or there is something that Java/Android give us that accomplish that. Thanks.

 On the client side (my console application) i've added an service reference to my webservice. This way I'm able to make calls over HTTP. However when using HTTPS i'm getting an error saying the following "There was no endpoint listening at https://test.mywebsite.nl/service.svc that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details." The app.config from my console application looks like this; <client>
      <endpoint address="https://test.mywebsite.nl/service.svc" 
                binding="basicHttpBinding"
                bindingConfiguration="BasicHttpBinding_IProxyInterface1"
                contract="Service.IProxyInterface1" 
                name="BasicHttpBinding_IProxyClientInterface" />

 When i'm looking at the inner exception I'm looking at an 404-error. I've tried various suggestion from other topics on SO and also articles at MS, but I must be missing something since i'm still represented with the same error. Anybody any idea what I'm doing wrong here?

@TITLE:Why OnGroupClick redraws the ExpandableList
@CONTENT:I am new to Android. I have a ExpandableListView, where I have managed to highlight (persistent) the selected item/child. But when I click/touch the group, the highlighted item goes away and seems like list has been redrawn. In onGroupClick, I am try to keep the highlighted item highlighted, but even then it redraws the list.     @Override
public boolean onGroupClick(ExpandableListView parent, View v,
        int groupPosition, long id) {
    // TODO keepSelectedModuleHighlited. Right now its not working.
    if (parent.isGroupExpanded(groupPosition)) {
        parent.collapseGroup(groupPosition);
    } else {
        parent.expandGroup(groupPosition);
    }

    keepSelectedModuleHighlited();

    return true;
}
 And method : keepSelectedModuleHighlited     private void keepSelectedModuleHighlited() {
    if (lastSelectedView != null && lastSelectedDrawble != null) {
        lastSelectedView.setBackgroundDrawable(this.getResources()
                .getDrawable(R.drawable.module_selected));
    }

}
 How can I put my method just after it redraws the list? Any Idea?
@CODE:ExpandableListView onGroupClick @Override
public boolean onGroupClick(ExpandableListView parent, View v,
        int groupPosition, long id) {
    // TODO keepSelectedModuleHighlited. Right now its not working.

        parent.collapseGroup(groupPosition);
    } else {
        parent.expandGroup(groupPosition);
    }

    keepSelectedModuleHighlited();

    return true;

@LINK:/questions/14478985/jquery-ajax-loads-jsonp-from-localhost-but-doesnt-return-data
@TITLE:jQuery AJAX loads JSONP from localhost but doesn't return data
@CONTENT:I'm trying to load some JSONP from my localhost. I have a PHP webapp that returns JSON with a callback if it is provided. The JSON that is returned is 100% valid (checked with JSON Validator). The url looks like this: http://localhost/backstage/public/data/acties?callback=?
 Now when I try to load this data with jQuery AJAX, it gives me the alert saying 'error', implying that the loading has failed. var url = "http://localhost/backstage/public/data/acties";

$("#debug").click(function() {
    console.log("getting data from " + url);
    $.ajax({
       type:'GET',
       url: url,
       dataType:'jsonp',
       success: function(data){
           alert('loaded');
       },
       error: function(data){
           alert('error');        
       }
    });
});
 However, when I go to the network tab I see a request has been made to: http://localhost/backstage/public/data/acties?callback=jQuery19008035339566413313_1358941083680&_=1358941083681
 And the content in this file is valid JSON (again, I validated it using JSON Validator). The data just doesn't seem to end up in my data variable in JavaScript. For reference, this is my PHP (Zend 1.12) code: public function actiesAction()
    {
        $data = new Application_Model_DbTable_Actie();
        $data = $data->fetchAll();
        $callback = htmlspecialchars($_GET["callback"]);
        $data = Zend_Json::encode($data);

        echo $callback.'('.$data.');';     
    }
 and this is the JSONP that you get when you go to http://localhost/backstage/public/data/acties?callback=?
 --> http://pastebin.com/tazcUQAW Does anyone know how to fix this please?

@TITLE:How to pass HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to aspx pages from IIS
@CONTENT:I have my site running on Amazon ELB. I need to capture client's IP address for something we do on the site - it's not ideal, but we definitely need the IP for now. This used to work great on a dedicated server. But since moving to ELB, I only get ELB's internal ip address as client's ip address when I use Request.UserHostAddress Going from some blogs I added X-Forwarded-For and even though my IIS logs have right client IP, that IP is not passed to the actual web pages.. Infact, there is no such field in the header.. or anything close to that in the header. Inspecting the Request.Headers.ToString() gives me my session cookies, other cookies, client browser (correctly) and other such things but there is nothing about any IP. In fact, I cannot even see the elb's static ip. Request.Headers["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"] is always null, understandably. How do I get the real client IP from C#, please?

@TITLE:Dragonfly - Uploaded images not displayed
@CONTENT:I am using dragonfly with jruby and apache tomcat to upload images. I am trying to display images that i am uplaoding dynamically using profile_picture.thumb('30x30#').url When I run the app using ruby on rails, the images are shown properly. But when I run it using apache tomcat, the images are not displayed. I think as we deploy war file in jruby, the convention profile_picture.thumb('30x30#').url is not working here. I also tried to use match '/media(/:dragonfly)', :to => Dragonfly[:images] in my routes, but was of no use. I do not get error, but in web page some code is displayed like "BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIpMjAxMy8wMS8wOS8xMl8xNl80NF83MDNfUGVuZ3VpbnMuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIgszMHgzMCMGOwZU" in page source code i got the path as, /media/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIpMjAxMy8wMS8wOS8xMl8xNl80NF83MDNfUGVuZ3VpbnMuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIgszMHgzMCMGOwZU Please help me to know the proper way to display images uploaded using dragonfly in jruby using apache tomcat.

@CONTENT:We have a java project that uses Hibernate as the OR Mapper. We need the project to work with both Oracle and Mysql. because some customers don't want to install Oracle. we have added @sequenceGenerator annotation on entities to have sequence. but the project can not connect to Mysql DBMS with these annotations. Is there any way that we can have sequences in both mysql and Oracle mode, without any changes?

@TITLE:Read Pervasive Database 9 without creating ODBC DSN
@CONTENT:I am writing an application in C# (.NET 4.0) which has to integrate with another, much older application. Part of the requirement is that my program must read data from three Btrieve files. I can assume that these Btrieve data files will already exist on the computers where my program is installed, and I can also assume that Pervasive PSQL V9 will also be installed and the relational and transactional service programs are running. I have the associated DDF files, and I can install them as part of my application. The way they were created I have to put them in a different directory to where the Btrieve data files are. (They have to be a sub-directory of the directory where the data files are). I didn't know anything about Pervasive or Btrieve when I started, but after a bit of experimentation I have got to the point where I can create a DSN using the 32 bit ODBC administration tool, and I can read from the data files using the ODBC ADO connector. All good so far. My question is, is it possible to read from these files from my .NET program without having to create an ODBC DSN on the machine? In other words, is it possible to specify the directory where the *.DAT files are and the directory where the *.DDF files are in the ODBC connection string? I'm not committed to using ODBC, I'm happy to use OLEDB or any other technology that allows me to reliably read from these files using .NET.

@CONTENT:As i see in all RestKit documentations, didWSRequestLoadObjects delegate function is used to handle service response. The problem is, if I have a different requests (postObject) in my view controller i have to check response type in didWSRequestLoadObjects for each request. Is there a way to register a function before each postObject and get each response in different function?

@TITLE:capybara: post, get methods not working when changing name of requests directory to features
@CONTENT:After upgrading to the latest version of Capybara, all of my visit methods stopped working so I followed a solution presented by some people which was to rename the requests spec directory to "features". Now my visit methods are working again but any get or post method in a request spec causes this error: undefined method `get' for #<RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup::Nested_1::Nested_1::Nested_1::Nested_1::Nested_1:0x007f9cce9adc20>
 Here's the code that triggers the error: describe "getting posts" do
    before { get(forum_posts_path) }
    it "should respond with a 200" do
        response.response_code.should == 200
    end
end
 Any workaround for this?

 but I can't figure out the C# equivalent to this XAML. Specifically, I want to, from C#, change the image that's displayed in an Image object. I tried this:         ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames animation = new ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames();
        animation.BeginTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0);
        Storyboard.SetTargetName(animation, "image");

        myStoryboard.Children.Add(animation);
        myStoryboard.Begin();
 and I get the error "Additional information: No applicable name scope exists to resolve the name 'image'." In my XAML for the controls, the x:name is "image" <Image x:Name="image" ... />
 I also tried Storyboard.SetTargetName(animation, image.Name); and got the same error.

@TITLE:JQuery Won't Slide Out a Second Time
@CONTENT:As a follow up from my previous question, I currently have this code on my live site: http://jsfiddle.net/3veht/6/ It is the exact same thing as on the live site. But for some reason, when I go to open one of the drawers, it will work a single time (open and close) then if I try again, it will not work. No errors in console at all. If I reload the page, it will work that single time again, then not open again. To help, it is getting to the data sending part because it is returning data, it just won't slide down the drawer. Maybe there is a better way to handle the slidedown for unique items? Here's a preview from the above fiddle:  $('.patient').click(function(){
                 var pat = $(this);
                 if ($('#drawer').is(':visible'))
                     $('#drawer').slideUp("slow", function () {

                        $('#drawer').slideDown('slow')
                        $('#drawer').load('/echo/js?js=' + pat.data('patientid'));       
                     });
                 else   
                 {
                     $('#drawer').slideDown('slow')
                     $('#drawer').load('/echo/js?js=' + pat.data('patientid'));
                 }
             });
 EDIT: Drawer by default is set in css to display:none I also notice when the drawer closes it sets a style to display:block to the drawer. Maybe that helps.. Also, looking at the source, Jquery thinks it is showing the drawer. The animation is visibly moving in the source but nothing on the screen.
@CODE:$('.patient').click(function(){
                 var pat = $(this);
                 if ($('#drawer').is(':visible'))

@LINK:/questions/14472004/how-to-use-fgets-and-sscanf-for-integers-in-loop
@TITLE:how to use fgets and sscanf for integers in loop
@CONTENT:Beginner with C here. I am trying to run a loop where strings and ints are entered into various fields of a struct. When prompted for a 'last name', the user can press enter with no other input and the loop should end. The problem is that with this code, the loop doesnt end (last name and first name entry requests run together on the same line) and the value for salary always comes out wrong (0 or some large number) while (employee_num <= 2)
{
    printf("Enter last name ");
    fgets(employee[employee_num].last_name, sizeof(employee[employee_num].last_name), stdin);                   

    if(strlen(employee[employee_num].last_name) == 0)
        break;

    printf("Enter first name ");
    fgets(employee[employee_num].first_name, sizeof(employee[employee_num].first_name), stdin);

    printf("Enter title ");
    fgets(employee[employee_num].title, sizeof(employee[employee_num].title), stdin);

    printf("Enter salary ");
    fgets(strng_buffer, 1, stdin);
    sscanf(strng_buffer, "%d", &employee[employee_num].salary);     
    ++employee_num;
    getchar();
}
 If I try this code instead, I am able to exit the loop properly after the first run through it, but cannot exit after that (by pressing enter at the last name portion - perhaps a \n I cant seem to clear?): char strng_buffer[16];
while (employee_num <= 5)
{
    printf("Enter last name ");
    fgets(strng_buffer, sizeof(strng_buffer), stdin);                   
    sscanf(strng_buffer, "%s", employee[employee_num].last_name);       

    if(strlen(employee[employee_num].last_name) == 0)
        break;

    printf("Enter first name ");
    fgets(strng_buffer, sizeof(strng_buffer), stdin);
    sscanf(strng_buffer, "%s", employee[employee_num].first_name);


    printf("Enter title ");
    fgets(strng_buffer, sizeof(strng_buffer), stdin);
    sscanf(strng_buffer, "%s", employee[employee_num].title);

    printf("Enter salary ");
    scanf("%d", &employee[employee_num].salary);        
    ++employee_num;
    getchar();
}
 I am curious as to how to make this work as intended and what best practice would be for entries like this (ie use of sscanf, fgets, etc) Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:To what extent should I enforce a DOM element's ID's uniqueness?
@CONTENT:I'm experiencing an issue which has two possible solutions. I am unsure which solution is 'more correct.' I have a modal dialog which opens above a page. This dialog hosts an element with ID "foo". Now, that is not an issue at all on its own. However, the non-dialog page has multiple tabs. One of these other tabs, deep down in some content, also has an ID "foo." This causes weird, intermittent issues depending on which "foo" is encountered first when traversing the DOM tree. Unfortunately, both values are presenting exactly the same information in exactly the same way. The only difference is that one is being hosted inside of a dialog. The same model is being used -- thus the same ID is being generated by my ViewModel. I can do one of two things: Explicitly override one of these ID-creation methods to ensure that the ID generated in the dialog is unique when compared to that of the non-dialog. Modify my jQuery search selector to only read from the dialog's form inward -- ensuring that the dialog will not capture unexpected DOM elements. It would seem like the second idea is a better practice. I traverse less DOM nodes and don't have to hack anything in. However, to an unknowing developer, one could still accidentally re-introduce this issue by not starting searching from the proper area. The same issue could be said to any developer working on our application, though. They would need to know explicitly to override the ID-creation of the ViewModel such that it does not create the same ID. Is it ever acceptable to have repeating IDs if they're encapsulated in different forms? Where does the expectation of an ID being unique cease to make sense? The ID is generated through MVC's EditorFor HTML Helper. I can override this in such a way that it generates a form-specific ID, but that was clearly not MVC's intention. <%= Html.EditorFor(model => model.CustomerDisplayName) %>
 UPDATE: It appears I should be enforcing the IDs uniqueness. However, ASP.NET MVC3 does not seem to provide an easy way of ensuring an ID is unique to the DOM. I can append on the form's ID, but that would generate huge IDs.. not sure if that is the best call. Any thoughts?

If they tab away, or minimize the window, time should not count towards the time on page until they look at the tab again. I assume some combination of javascript and server side work will be necessary. A couple of issues I'm struggling with: What's the best way to store this information in the database? How do I, with Javascript, capture the time on page with a reasonable degree of accuracy? Do I store events like "page loaded", "user idle", "user returned", "page unloaded", and then separately process all the events in the DB to come up with a time on page?

END
 But my question is about the relationship between customer_table and customer_stg is it possible to include a customer_id within the customer_stg bulk insert? with something like so? ( I'm not sure how to apply the foreign key parameter @customer_sk to the bulk insert ). CREATE PROCEDURE import_customer_from_txt_para @filelocation varchar(100), @customer_sk int
AS BEGIN

    TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.[customer_stg]
    DECLARE @sql nvarchar(4000) = '
    BULK INSERT customer_stg
    FROM ''' + @filelocation + '''
    WITH
    (
        FIRSTROW=14,
        FIELDTERMINATOR=''\t'',
        ROWTERMINATOR=''\n''
    )';
    print @sql;
    exec(@sql);

END
 Preferably after each bulk-insert I'd wish to be able to relate the data between the two tables.
@CODE:\t # columnA columnB columnC
data_pointA data_pointB data_pointC CREATE PROCEDURE import_customer_from_txt_para @filelocation varchar(100)
AS BEGIN

    TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.[customer_stg]
    DECLARE @sql nvarchar(4000) = '
    BULK INSERT customer_stg
    FROM ''' + @filelocation + '''
    WITH
    (
        FIRSTROW=14,
        FIELDTERMINATOR=''\t'',
        ROWTERMINATOR=''\n''
    )';
    print @sql;
    exec(@sql);

END customer_table customer_stg customer_stg @customer_sk CREATE PROCEDURE import_customer_from_txt_para @filelocation varchar(100), @customer_sk int
AS BEGIN

    TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.[customer_stg]
    DECLARE @sql nvarchar(4000) = '

@TITLE:Perl and wireshark export file dialog
@CONTENT:I am interested in opening a capture file in wireshark and then exporting the data in "C arrays" format [Wireshark provides that option in its GUI. One can do it by following "File->Export->as C arrays file" from the main menu.My question is how can I do this in perl? Can someone help me with a script for this? I Would like to parse each and every packet of the wireshark capture. So I thought, I will first convert each packet to an array and then parse it. Do you have any suggestions on this?

@CONTENT:I have been successfully learning how to use Delegates. To date, I have learnt how to pass data to a secondViewController using storyBoards via the prepareForSegue method and then return data from the secondViewController back to first ViewController using Delegates. The problem is when I create a thirdViewController as follows: ViewController >> secondViewController >> thirdViewController. (the delegate protocol is set in the thirdViewController) My delegate works fine passing data from thirdViewController to secondViewController. The problem is when passing from secondViewController back to the viewController -(void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender{

SecondViewController *page2 = [[SecondViewController alloc]init];
[[segue identifier] isEqual:@"page2"];
page2 = [segue destinationViewController];
page2.delegate = self; // this is the problem ??
 } The error i get is as follows: Property 'delegate' not found. Is the problem that Delegates don't work in multiple views (in a chain) like this ??

@LINK:/questions/14468822/exchange-web-services-streaming-subscription-timeout-when-opening-connection
@TITLE:Exchange Web Services Streaming Subscription timeout when opening connection
@CONTENT:I am currently troubleshooting an issue related to Exchange Web Services. The issue is that, upon opening a connection to a Streaming Subscription (via the StreamingSubscriptionConnection object), the operation hangs when calling the Open method. Here is the code that hangs, for reference: _streamingSubscriptionConnection = new StreamingSubscriptionConnection(_exchangeService, _connectionLifetime);
_streamingSubscriptionConnection.AddSubscription(_subscription);
_streamingSubscriptionConnection.OnNotificationEvent += new StreamingSubscriptionConnection.NotificationEventDelegate(OnNotificationEvent);
_streamingSubscriptionConnection.OnSubscriptionError += new StreamingSubscriptionConnection.SubscriptionErrorDelegate(OnSubscriptionError);
_streamingSubscriptionConnection.OnDisconnect += new StreamingSubscriptionConnection.SubscriptionErrorDelegate(OnDisconnect);
_streamingSubscriptionConnection.Open();
 It usually takes about two minutes and then it throws a ServiceRequestException whose message is: The request has failed. The operation has timed out. It's also worth mentioning that even if I set the timeout to a minute, it will still take longer than a minute and then throw this exception. The call never gets past that Open command. My questions are, has anyone come across this in the past? Additionally, are there any tools available that I can use to diagnose any connection issues to determine if the exception is on my end, the Exchange servers end, or somewhere in the middle? I've tried Fiddler and Microsoft Network Monitor to look for any patterns but I'm having a hard time discerning anything. Thanks in advance! EDIT: To add on to this, if I add a trace listener I get quite a lot of output. I can see it retrieve the Subscription Id and then attempt to connect. When it sends out the request to connect, this is what is logged between the time the Open command is issued and the timeout: <Trace Tag="EwsRequestHttpHeaders" Tid="10" Time="2013-01-24 19:16:18Z">

@TITLE:Has jQuery an 'animating'-event?
@CONTENT:Has jQuery an animating-event (not :animated)? Something like step, but as extra method/event? Currently I trigger a custom event in each animations step-function: $('.foo').animate({property: 'value'}, {
    step: function(now, fx){
        $(this).trigger('animating', [now, fx])
    }
});

$('.foo').on('animating', function(e, now, fx){
    // do what you want
});
 I think there's somewhere in the wild assuredly a better solution. Any ideas/approaches? Update I've written a (of course not awesome) special event, what make's handling this problem a bit easier: (function($){
    var oldStep = $.fx.step._default;
    jQuery.event.special.animating = { };
    $.fx.step._default = function( fx ) {
        $(fx.elem).trigger('animating', fx);
        oldStep.apply( this, arguments );
    };
}(jQuery));
 This doesn't work with jQuery 1.7+ since jQuery's animation method was changed, or rather the step function is not longer extendable ($.fx.step results in an empty object). jQuery.fx refers to Tween.prototype.init; & jQuery.fx.step to {}; So it can't work... I look still further on every tip!
@CODE:animating :animated step $('.foo').animate({property: 'value'}, {

@LINK:/questions/14467376/are-there-more-elegant-ways-of-querying-data-based-on-values-stored-in-attribute
@TITLE:Are there more elegant ways of querying data based on values stored in attribute-value table?
@CONTENT:I have an attribute-value table av that looks like this: | attribute | value |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| a1        | A1    |
| b1        | BB1   |
| b2        | BB2   |
 For simplicity, assume varchar(255) on both attribute and value columns, unique index on attribute. I need to use the values of specific attributes in a query, which looks like this: SELECT *
FROM   t1
      ,t2
WHERE  t1.a1 = "A1"  -- Value of "a1" attribute
 AND   t1.id = t2.id
 AND   t2.b1 = "BB1"  -- Value of "b1" attribute
 AND   t2.b2 = "BB2"  -- Value of "b2" attribute
 Is there an elegant way of doing this in Sybase ASE (12 or 15) which scales well as we increase the # of tables and attributes? By "scale" I mean ~10-20 attributes needed across 4-5 joined tables I can think of the following solutions, all of which seem to suck: SOLUTION 1: Obvious: Join AV table, once per attribute SELECT *
FROM   t1
      ,t2
      ,av AS 'av_a1'
      ,av AS 'av_b1'
      ,av AS 'av_b2'
WHERE  t1.a1 = av_a1.value
 AND   t1.id = t2.id
 AND   t2.b1 = av_b1.value
 AND   t2.b2 = av_b2.value
 AND   av_a1.attribute = "a1"
 AND   av_b1.attribute = "b1"
 AND   av_b2.attribute = "b2"
 Pros: Obvious. Cons: Scales VERY poorly as far as code quality, and probably performance as well. SOLUTION 2: Avoid the headache of multiple joins with variables declare @a1 varchar(255)
select  @a1 = value FROM av WHERE attribute = "a1"
declare @b1 varchar(255)
select  @b1 = value FROM av WHERE attribute = "b1"
declare @b2 varchar(255)
select  @b2 = value FROM av WHERE attribute = "b2"

SELECT *
FROM   t1
      ,t2
WHERE  t1.a1 = @a1
 AND   t1.id = t2.id
 AND   t2.b1 = @b1
 AND   t2.b2 = @b2
 Pros: No more extra joins making the query both ugly and poorly performing. Cons: Scales somewhat poorly as far as code quality (need to add new variables with new attributes). Any better solutions?
@CODE:av | attribute | value |

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use a simple jquery-ui modal dialog as a delete confirmation in an ASP.NET C# application. I've done this many times before, but for some reason in this application it is misbehaving. I see the dialog pop up then it immediately disappears before I can click on either "Yes" or "No". Here's the relevant code (Javascript):     <script type="text/javascript" src="/resources/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>

@TITLE:Entity Framework - Saving results to the database asyncronously
@CONTENT:I have a web-service which gets called every few seconds, which does a bunch of things and then performs a bulk insert which currently takes half a second on average to call SaveChanges(). I'd like to save all the changes asynchronously because then I can call my web-service multiple times per second and just buffer any database changes to be saved by a quartz timer, which should lead to better performance. I've observed that after a web-service function executes, if the "SaveChanges" was not called on the entity database model object, any pending database changes will be rolled back. Is it possible for me to asynchronously save my changes to the database and how would I go about doing it?

@TITLE:URL having parentheses not working in codeigniter with datamapper ORM
@CONTENT:I'm using codeigniter with datamapper ORM, today I've noticed a strange error. I have a function named categories, which links from item page. url to category is formed using the name of the category and is encoded using rawurlencode. In category method I decode this url string and find the category using get_by_name. this works well except when the name of the category includes parentheses suppose I have a item "ABCDEFGHI" which belongs to category "Alphabets (English)". now category after running rawurlencode gives string "Alphabets%20%28English%29" which when I run rawurkdecode becomes again "Alphabets (English)" as expected. <?php
$a = "Alphabets (English)";
$b = rawurlencode("Alphabets (English)");
$c = rawurldecode($b);
echo ($a == $c); //returns 1
?>
 So I know that $a and $c is equal. I even tested method given below by replacing the exact string value say "Alphabets (English)" and it works but using rawurldecode doesn't. But still the following method returns nil a 404 page. function categories($url = '',$page = 1){
    $url = rawurldecode($url);
  //echo $url;
  //I tried echo here and it gives "Alphabets (English)"
    $cat = new Category();
    $cat->get_by_name($url);
  // replacing $url with the string output from echo $url 
  //in above call works. what is happening here?
  // $cat->get_by_name("Alphabets (English)"); works but 
  // $cat->get-by_name($url); doesn't
    if(empty($cat->id)){
        show_404();
    }
    else{
      // work to do//
    }
}
 I know I shouldn't have used this approach, i should've titleize the name of categories and have an extra field in table. But I don't want ro break links now. I hope you understood my problem. Please give me some clue. help me figure out the issue. Thanks! Edited I read manual of rawurlencode, someone said on this page http://php.net/manual/pt_BR/function.rawurlencode.php Note also that some characters are currently "reserved" but should have instead been considered as "unsafe": this includes the parenthesis "()" which are clearly unsafe when a URL is used in MIME headers. Because of this, if a valid URL contains "()" characters, one should use an upper-level encoding to either enclose the URL with a pair of "unsafe" characters defined in the upper-level protocol (for example a "<>" pair in MIME headers, because these characters cannot be part of a valid URL)... I believe either codeigniter or datamapper or both are not allowing these parenthesis characters. if you found some solution please help. I tried adding parentheses to allowed uri characters in codeigniter config and still no luck.
@CODE:<?php
$a = "Alphabets (English)";
$b = rawurlencode("Alphabets (English)");

@TITLE:Alternative to jQuery's .toggle() method that supports eventData?
@CONTENT:The jQuery documentation for the .toggle() method states: The .toggle() method is provided for convenience. It is relatively straightforward to implement the same behavior by hand, and this can be necessary if the assumptions built into .toggle() prove limiting. The assumptions built into .toggle have proven limiting for my current task, but the documentation doesn't elaborate on how to implement the same behavior. I need to pass eventData to the handler functions provided to toggle(), but it appears that only .bind() will support this, not .toggle(). My first inclination is to use a flag that's global to a single handler function to store the click state. In other words, rather than: $('a').toggle(function() {
  alert('odd number of clicks');
}, function() {
  alert('even number of clicks');
});
 do this: var clicks = true;
$('a').click(function() {
  if (clicks) {
    alert('odd number of clicks');
    clicks = false;
  } else {
    alert('even number of clicks');
    clicks = true;
  }
});
 I haven't tested the latter, but I suspect it would work. Is this the best way to do something like this, or is there a better way that I'm missing? Thanks!

So far I'm able to calculate age based on given DOB, however I'm having issues singling out these persons. I'm thinking this is a simple issue but I'm stumped, see sql statement. Can someone please point me in the right direction. SELECT ip_master.ssn, ip_master.firstname, ip_master.surname, ip_master.status,

CASE WHEN DATEADD(YEAR, DATEDIFF (YEAR, dob, '2013/03/31'), dob) > '2013/03/31'
THEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, dob, '2013/03/31') - 1
ELSE DATEDIFF(YEAR, dob, '2013/03/31')
END AS 'Age'

FROM test_db.dbo.ip_master ip_master

 Basically all works ok at the moment but I want to avoid multiples occurring and to put all the other boxes at the end. There can be 99 of these screens. At the moment say I select 5 options I could get A, B, B, otherbox and otherbox I want it to have if A is selected more than once only display A and the same for all letters to G The issue comes with the other box at H which can have multiples so you could have A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, H, H, H AND H I hope this makes sense and any solutions very much appreciated. N.B. Important to note the XML is created for each screen so I could have 99 different XMLs with something different selected everytime. this is where the for-each part is tricky. maybe it can detect if more than 1 of A is selected. thanks

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Why does codeigniter store its sessiondata in a cookie? 4 answers all CI users know that by default sessions are stored in cookies. But what exactly is the point of this implementation? I really can't find a good reason. OK, in a shared server people might gain access to the session files but what about the client side? I could change the data in the cookie as well and being a "one-way" method how do I even validate the data in session cookie on the server side? I find it very odd, not to mention the cookie could encounter problems of size. I'm aware of the database method but what if I'm in a dedicated server with full control and I don't want to waste db resources to query the session table at very single page wouldn't have been more flexible/useful to offer by default the classic PHP method so I can validate the data with the ID in the cookie?

@CONTENT:I am making the transition to iPhone programming and found how to display Image in ImageView? to answer some of my questions, but did not specify a couple of basics, namely what kind of project(s) can display an image, and where in the project the code can be put. I created an empty project and am getting errors for the last two lines of: CGRect myImageRect = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 109.0f);
UIImageView *myImage = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:myImageRect]; 
[myImage setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"myImage.png"]];
myImage.opaque = YES; // explicitly opaque for performance 
[self.view addSubview:myImage]; 
[myImage release]; 
 If I am going to display a clock face, eventually one with rotating hands but for now the goal is to display the face itself, can I do it with a basic project, or do I need to start over with another project, and where should I be placing the sample code? http://www.iphoneexamples.com/ has AFAICT some excellent examples, but they seem to assume you know where to put the code in question, and that you have chosen whatever is the most appropriate project. So, let's say I am not trying to animate the clock hands immediately, and for now I want my (PNG) clock face to show, optionally well-positioned on the screen. What kind of project do I start with, where do I put the code to display the image, and what code should I be using to display the image?
@CODE:CGRect myImageRect = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 109.0f);

@CONTENT:I have a code for a function which is called inside another function.(Result of refactoring). So in the called function I have a huge block of try-catch statements as. def Called():
     try:
         #All statements for the function in the try block.

     except A:

 The problem I have is that I need to catch two exceptions of the same type (At different locations in the Called function). Which then are handled by the Calling function. One way would be to define two try-except blocks within the Called function. But I am not understanding how the Calling function can handle two exceptions of the same type differently.

@TITLE:Indirection in dust.js
@CONTENT:Is it possible to achieve variable indirection in dust.js - and therefore to be able to use map-like functionality? Imagine I have the following context to pass to Dust: {
  "keys": [ "Foo", "Bar", "Baz" ],
  "data": [{
      "date": "20130101",
      "values": {
        "Foo": 1,
        "Bar": 2,
        "Baz": 3
      }
    }, {
      "date": "20130102",
      "values": {
        "Foo": 4,
        "Bar": 5,
        "Baz": 6
      }
    }]
}
 And I want to achieve the following output (it would actually be a table, but I've skipped the <tr><td> tags for brevity and replaced them with spaces and newlines): Date Foo Bar Baz
20130101 1 2 3
20130102 4 5 6
 I'm not sure how to loop over the keys property, and use each value x to look up data[i].values[x]. I can get the desired output by hardcoding the keys: Date{~s}
{#keys}
  {.}{~s}
{/keys}
{~n}
{#data}
  {date}{~s}
  {values.Foo}{~s}
  {values.Bar}{~s}
  {values.Baz}{~s}
  {~n}
{/data}
 but the keys will be determined dynamically, so I can't hardcode them into the template. Is there a way to replace the lines that say values.Foo etc., with something like the following: {#data}
  {date}{~s}
  {#keys outerMap=values}
    {outerMap.{.}}{~s}
  {/keys}
  {~n}
{/data}
 This doesn't work as written; can I capture the output of {.} (the value of the current key) and dynamically use it as (part of) the property name to resolve?
@CODE:{
  "keys": [ "Foo", "Bar", "Baz" ],
  "data": [{
      "date": "20130101",
      "values": {
        "Foo": 1,
        "Bar": 2,
        "Baz": 3
      }
    }, {
      "date": "20130102",
      "values": {
        "Foo": 4,
        "Bar": 5,
        "Baz": 6
      }
    }]
} <tr><td> Date Foo Bar Baz
20130101 1 2 3
20130102 4 5 6 keys x data[i].values[x] Date{~s}

@LINK:/questions/14460915/android-how-to-immediately-endcall-with-telephonyservice
@TITLE:Android - How to immediately endCall with telephonyService?
@CONTENT:In my application, there's a feature that ends outgoing call (and starts other activities) while dialing a certain number (e.g. *123*) It's currently working, but requires a 200ms delay. Without the delay, the intent cannot be recieved. The delay causes a consequence of multiple screen flickers: my activity shows -> switch to call -> end call -> switch back to my activity public class OutgoingCallListener extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // ...
    public void onReceive(final Context context, Intent intent) {
        // ...
        if(intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL)) {
            // ...
            if(number.equals("*123*")) {
                // ...
                Handler handler = new Handler();
                handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
                    public void run() {
                        telephonyService.endCall();
                    }
                }, 200);
            }
        }
    }
}
 I'v seen other applications with this special-number-dialing feature, the call ends immediately wihout the end-call-beep, and switches to app activity without flickering. Q1: Does anyone know how to end call without delay? Is there another intent that we can catch before ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL? Q2: On a mobile phone with low specs (slow CPU, less memory), would BroadcastReceiver work the same way as on a decent phone?
@CODE:*123* my activity shows switch to call end call switch back to my activity public class OutgoingCallListener extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // ...
    public void onReceive(final Context context, Intent intent) {
        // ...
        if(intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL)) {
            // ...
            if(number.equals("*123*")) {
                // ...
                Handler handler = new Handler();
                handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
                    public void run() {
                        telephonyService.endCall();
                    }
                }, 200);
            }
        }
    }

@TITLE:spring-ws get username & password
@CONTENT:I've been learning spring-ws for little over a week and I've set up a simple web service. I'm testing it using soapui and specifying a username and password in the request properties. My web service has no security layer nor do I want to add one. I just need to pull the username and password out of the request to make requests to another service. I don't want to have to specify a username or password in my request body itself. All I want to do is retrieve the username and password from the request from soapui. Does anyone know where the username and password are in the request? Are they in a http header or the soap header. The soap header appears to be empty in soapui. I have tried writing my own interceptor to my endpoint and getting the soap header but it appears to be empty. I have also tried retrieving them using SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication(); but this returns null. I also tried to interrogate the HttpServletRequest from my endpoint to see if the user details were in there, sadly not. Does anyone have any ideas or good knowledge of this area?

 But no matter what XPath expression I use (ex: //subform or field[@name='DropDownList1']), SelectSingleNode always returns null, and SelectNodes returns an empty list. Am I doing something wrong here? If there is a better way of doing this, I'd love to know. Here's some the xml (I want the field node): <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@TITLE:How to code run method in Thread pooling
@CONTENT:I got very confused by reading Thread Pooling. I learnt the concept, how they actually works. But I confused in the part , how to code this. I searched a lot on the net. Finally I got a blog, that have codes , given below, CONDITION IS, NOT TO USE IN-BUILT CLASS Code 1 public class ThreadPool {

  private BlockingQueue taskQueue = null;
  private List<PoolThread> threads = new ArrayList<PoolThread>();
  private boolean isStopped = false;

  public ThreadPool(int noOfThreads, int maxNoOfTasks){
    taskQueue = new BlockingQueue(maxNoOfTasks);

    for(int i=0; i<noOfThreads; i++){
      threads.add(new PoolThread(taskQueue));
    }
    for(PoolThread thread : threads){
      thread.start();
    }
  }

  public void synchronized execute(Runnable task){
    if(this.isStopped) throw
      new IllegalStateException("ThreadPool is stopped");

    this.taskQueue.enqueue(task);
  }

  public synchronized void stop(){
    this.isStopped = true;
    for(PoolThread thread : threads){
      thread.stop();
    }
  }

}
 Code 2 public class PoolThread extends Thread {
  private BlockingQueue taskQueue = null;
  private boolean       isStopped = false;
  public PoolThread(BlockingQueue queue){
    taskQueue = queue;
  }
  public void run(){
    while(!isStopped()){
      try{
        Runnable runnable = (Runnable) taskQueue.dequeue();
        runnable.run();
      } catch(Exception e){
        //log or otherwise report exception,
        //but keep pool thread alive.
      }
    }
  }
  public synchronized void stop(){
    isStopped = true;
    this.interrupt(); //break pool thread out of dequeue() call.
  }
  public synchronized void isStopped(){
    return isStopped;
  }
}
 Code 3:- public class BlockingQueue {

  private List queue = new LinkedList();
  private int  limit = 10;

  public BlockingQueue(int limit){
    this.limit = limit;
  }

  public synchronized void enqueue(Object item)
  throws InterruptedException  {
    while(this.queue.size() == this.limit) {
      wait();
    }
    if(this.queue.size() == 0) {
      notifyAll();
    }
    this.queue.add(item);
  }

  public synchronized Object dequeue()
  throws InterruptedException{
    while(this.queue.size() == 0){
      wait();
    }
    if(this.queue.size() == this.limit){
      notifyAll();
    }

    return this.queue.remove(0);
  }    
}
 I tried to understand , what this code do. But I dont get the flow of this code. Can you help me to understand this code. Mainly I have problems in **Code 2 :- run method**

Why execute method's argument are of Runnable type?

How input array given to this code??
 Help me. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:put log4j logging httpclient
@CONTENT:I want to put on logging in httpclient with log4j. Doing this, I added a file commons-logging.properties with the content org.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger. Then I added a file log4j.properties with the following content provided by httpclient documentation as a logging example: log4j.rootLogger=INFO, stdout

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%5p [%c] %m%n

log4j.logger.org.apache.http=DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.apache.http.wire=ERROR
 Both files reside in the classpath. I put the following parameters -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties
-Dlog4j.debug
 However, when I run my programm which executes http requests with the httpclient I do not see any logging output. The latter parameter should make the output of log4j verbose in that sense, that it displays several things e.g. the used properties files. This is not displayed at all. What I tried as wel is to read out the logger programmaciatally with Logger.getLogger("log4j.logger.org.apache.http.wire").getLevel().toString()
 this throws an null pointer exception. Additionally I read LogManager.getCurrentLoggers().hasMoreElements()
 this is always false. It seems like log4j is not "activated" for httpclient. Can anyone help me here what I could do in order to turn the logging on? (Yes, I already read related topics here at stackoverflow) Thank you very much Felix

 This current configuration plays and loops the '1530.mp3', shouldn't it also play and loop '1507.mp3' too? Im open to any new method of doing this, like an array, which i think would be a better option. Just not so sure how to do so.

@LINK:/questions/14456694/mono-for-android-spinner-within-a-listview
@TITLE:Mono for Android: Spinner within a listview
@CONTENT:I have a listview which is populated from a webservice using an ArrayAdapter. The webservice provides me with all the data I need. Some are just plain textviews yet other alternate between EditText and spinners. I show them easily, also filling up the values where they're due in EditText fields. The problem comes with filling up the value of the Spinner. Can I define an adapter within an adapter? Also my data comes from a webservice as an XML passed as a string. My Spinner code so far inside my Adapter.cs: if (item.FieldType == "OptionBOX")
    {
        Spinner SpinnerValue = (Spinner) view.FindViewById<Spinner>(Resource.Id.spinnerVal);
        SpinnerValue.Visibility = view.Visibility == ViewStates.Invisible ? ViewStates.Invisible : ViewStates.Visible;

        bool isReadOnly = bool.Parse(item.isReadOnly);

        if (isReadOnly == true)
        {
            SpinnerValue.Enabled = false;
            SpinnerValue.Focusable = false;
            SpinnerValue.FocusableInTouchMode = false;
        }
    }
 My data for the spinner is within item.optbox_options. A table from my XML for easier understanding: <Table diffgr:id="Table5" msdata:rowOrder="4">
<IdRec>5</IdRec>
<FieldId>1026</FieldId>
<FieldDesc>stanje rezervoarja</FieldDesc>
<FieldType>ComboBOX</FieldType>
<isReadOnly>true</isReadOnly>
<FieldValue>6</FieldValue>
<FieldTextValue>2/4</FieldTextValue>
<OptBox_Options>
<Options><myOPT FieldValue="1" FieldTextValue="0"/><myOPT FieldValue="2" FieldTextValue="1/4"/><myOPT FieldValue="6" FieldTextValue="2/4"/><myOPT FieldValue="7" FieldTextValue="3/4"/><myOPT FieldValue="8" FieldTextValue="4/4"/></Options>
</OptBox_Options>
</Table>
 So just to clarify my needs and wants: Can I use an adapter within an adapter and if I can - how? How can I display data from the OptBox_Options row? I need to display the value from the FieldTextValue column inside in my spinners.
@CODE:if (item.FieldType == "OptionBOX")
    {
        Spinner SpinnerValue = (Spinner) view.FindViewById<Spinner>(Resource.Id.spinnerVal);
        SpinnerValue.Visibility = view.Visibility == ViewStates.Invisible ? ViewStates.Invisible : ViewStates.Visible;

        bool isReadOnly = bool.Parse(item.isReadOnly);

        if (isReadOnly == true)
        {
            SpinnerValue.Enabled = false;
            SpinnerValue.Focusable = false;
            SpinnerValue.FocusableInTouchMode = false;
        }
    } <Table diffgr:id="Table5" msdata:rowOrder="4">

@TITLE:how Google crawl content with jQuery's load function?
@CONTENT:I have a question regarding SEO, when you use the .load functionality in jQuery. You can load a document by referring to the href value of the link you clicked. In this first case, the folder name where the html documents are stored (../ajax/) is mentioned in the tag, not in jQuery: Code: <a href="ajax/test.html">test</a> var thelink = $(this).attr('href');
$('#content').load(thelink);
 Or you can load a document by adding the folder name of your html documents in your jQuery and not in your tag. Code: <a href="test.html">test</a> $('#content').load('ajax/test.html');
 I wonder which method is the most seo friendly. I now use the first example, but I noticed that the google spiders stop at my navigation, and don't go further to the other pages of the site. But I suppose if I try the second example, the google spiders stop aswel, because the target folder is not mentioned in the links... Anyone experience with this?

@LINK:/questions/14454781/hide-show-button-also-when-refreshed
@TITLE:Hide/Show button, also when refreshed
@CONTENT:I am making an application that displays "activities". Each activity has his own button. When you click on that button, you add that specific activity to your "guide". The idea is that you can add one specific activity only once, so the button of that activity must disapear when it's added to the guide. I can use a simple $(this).hide() in my javascript but that obviously doesn't work when I refresh the page. So I guess i should make a check if the activity exists in de guide. in the database I have 3 tables, 1: activity (with an ActivityID), 2: user (with a UserID) and 3: user_activity (with ActivityID and UserID, a linktable). So the check must check if the ActivityID exists in the user_activity table, and that the UserID that belongs to that ActivityID in the user_activity table is the sames as the current users' ID. At this moment, I know how to check the current users UserID: //userid
$sql = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE Username = '".$_SESSION['Username']."' ";
$stm = $db->prepare($sql);
$result = $stm->execute(array());
while($row = $stm->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
$userid = $row['UserID'];
}
 But I don't know how to check if the ActivityID already exists, and how I should make this if else statement. Ay the moment I use this script to display the activity (incl. the button) $sql = "SELECT * FROM activity";
$stm = $db->prepare($sql);
$result = $stm->execute(array());   

while($row = $stm->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC))

@TITLE:Issues with nextLine(); [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Scanner issue when using nextLine after nextInt I am trying create a program where it lets the user inputs values into an array using scanner. However, when the program asks for the student's next of kin, it doesn't let the user to input anything and straight away ends the program. Below is the code that I have done: if(index!=-1)
    {
        Function.print("Enter full name: ");
        stdName = input.nextLine();

        Function.print("Enter student no.: ");
        stdNo = input.nextLine();

        Function.print("Enter age: ");
        stdAge = input.nextInt();

        Function.print("Enter next of kin: ");
        stdKin = input.nextLine();

        Student newStd = new Student(stdName, stdNo, stdAge, stdKin);
        stdDetails[index] = newStd;
    }
 I have tried using next(); but it will only just take the first word of the user input which is not what I wanted. Is there anyway to solve this problem?
@CODE:if(index!=-1)
    {
        Function.print("Enter full name: ");

        stdNo = input.nextLine();

        Function.print("Enter age: ");
        stdAge = input.nextInt();

        Function.print("Enter next of kin: ");
        stdKin = input.nextLine();

        Student newStd = new Student(stdName, stdNo, stdAge, stdKin);
        stdDetails[index] = newStd;
    } stdName = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter full name: ");
