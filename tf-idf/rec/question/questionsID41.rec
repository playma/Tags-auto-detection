@TITLE:Azure Service Bus, determine if OnMessage stops processing
@CONTENT:Using Azure ServiceBus and the OnMessage call I am looking for a way to determine if the OnMessage event pump stops reading from the queue. Our connection to OnMessage is configured as below: protected virtual void DoSubscription(string queueName, Func<QueueRequest, bool> callback)
{
    var client = GetClient(queueName, PollingTimeout);
    var transformCallback = new Action<BrokeredMessage>((message) =>
    {
        try
        {
            var request = message.ToQueueRequest();
            if (callback(request))
            {
                message.Complete();
            }
            else
            {
                message.Abandon();
                Log.Warn("DoSubscription: Message Failed to Process Gracefully: {0}{1}", Environment.NewLine, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(request));
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Log.Error("DoSubscription: Message Failed to Process With Exception:", ex);
            message.Abandon();
        }
    });
    var options = new OnMessageOptions
    {
        MaxConcurrentCalls = _config.GetInt("MaxThreadsPerQueue"),
        AutoComplete = false,
        AutoRenewTimeout = new TimeSpan(0,0,1)
    };
    options.ExceptionReceived += OnMessageError;
    client.OnMessage(transformCallback, options);
}
 The problem we are encountering is after a period of time with no messages being queued new messages that are queued fail to be picked up by the OnMessage event pump until the application is restarted. I realize there are ways to do this using Worker Roles, however for monitoring and management purposes we decided to implement this in the Application Start of a web app.
@CODE:protected virtual void DoSubscription(string queueName, Func<QueueRequest, bool> callback)
{
    var client = GetClient(queueName, PollingTimeout);
    var transformCallback = new Action<BrokeredMessage>((message) =>
    {
        try
        {
            var request = message.ToQueueRequest();
            if (callback(request))
            {
                message.Complete();
            }
            else
            {
                message.Abandon();
                Log.Warn("DoSubscription: Message Failed to Process Gracefully: {0}{1}", Environment.NewLine, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(request));
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Log.Error("DoSubscription: Message Failed to Process With Exception:", ex);
            message.Abandon();
        }
    });
    var options = new OnMessageOptions
    {
        MaxConcurrentCalls = _config.GetInt("MaxThreadsPerQueue"),
        AutoComplete = false,
        AutoRenewTimeout = new TimeSpan(0,0,1)
    };
    options.ExceptionReceived += OnMessageError;
    client.OnMessage(transformCallback, options);
}

@LINK:/questions/31340989/code-for-peak-detection
@TITLE:Code for peak detection
@CONTENT:I want to calculate if a real-time signal pass some thresholds in the first step. In the first step, I want to detect if the real signal pass under those thresholds (in order to detect a peak in the signal). My Matlab code: k=1;  
t = 1;
l=1;

for i =1:length(sm) //sm my signal.

    if (sm(i) > 0.25)
        first(k) = i;
        k = k+1;
        if (sm(i) > 0.5)

            second(t) = i;
            t =t +1;
            if (sm(i) > 0.75)

                third(l) = i;
                l = l+1;
            end
        end
    end
end
 Example: ![enter image description here][1] I want to calculate the times that the signal pass over and under the three thresholds 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and to return those windows. Basically the three main peaks that I have in my example. Basically what am I trying to do is to use fastsmooth function and findpeaks. signalSmoothed = fastsmooth(sm,50); plot(signalSmoothed)
[max_pk1 max_pk2] = findpeaks(signalSmoothed);
find(max_pk1 >0.5)
inversex = 1.01*max(signalSmoothed) - signalSmoothed;
[min_pk1 min_pk2]  = findpeaks(inversex);
find(min_pk1 >0.5) 
 Which are the heuristics in order to take only the desired peaks? Moreover the depticted image is an offline example. Generally I want to perform the technique online. EDIT: I wrongfully defined as peak my desired curve result which is the whole wave not just the max value.
@CODE:k=1;  
t = 1;
l=1;

for i =1:length(sm) //sm my signal.

    if (sm(i) > 0.25)
        first(k) = i;
        k = k+1;
        if (sm(i) > 0.5)

            second(t) = i;
            t =t +1;
            if (sm(i) > 0.75)

                third(l) = i;
                l = l+1;
            end
        end
    end
end 0.25 0.5 0.75 signalSmoothed = fastsmooth(sm,50); plot(signalSmoothed)
[max_pk1 max_pk2] = findpeaks(signalSmoothed);

@TITLE:How to get the missing Wifi MAC Address on Android M Preview?
@CONTENT:Android developers looking to get the Wifi MAC Address on Android M may have experienced an issue where the standard Android OS API to get the MAC Address returns a fake MAC Address (02:00:00:00:00:00) instead of the real value. The normal way to get the Wifi MAC address is below: final WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) getApplication().getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);

final String wifiMACaddress = wifiManager.getConnectionInfo().getMacAddress();
 I hope this can help out some developers while Google is still investigating the MAC Address API issue! Thanks for reading.
@CODE:final WifiManager wifiManager = (WifiManager) getApplication().getApplicationContext().getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);

@TITLE:AngularJS : How to use the $q promise feature in this situation to wait for data to be ready?
@CONTENT:I have a Controller which starts an API call in a Factory. Currently I start the call, then I have a function after that call to check the status of the Array. However I'm not sure how to force it to wait here while the data is being gathered, thus the need for some kind of $q implementation. As you can see in the screenshot below, vs.tickers returns an empty Object, or Array. Then finally the console.log in GetTickersFactory fires: 1st Controller if (root.tickerType === 'portfolio') {

    // Call to factory to start the API GETS:
    GetTickersFactory.getTickers('portfolio');

    // I then call a function in the Factory to return the array
    // Which isn't ready yet of course since it returns undefined...
    vs.tickers = GetTickersFactory.returnPortfolioTickers();

    console.log('portfolio');
    console.log('vs.tickers = ', vs.tickers);
}
 getTickers function in the GetTickersFactory | Perhaps this helps: the Gist for the full Factory. function getTickers(type, load, searchedTicker) {
    load = load || loadString; searchedTicker = searchedTicker || '';

    var portfolioTickersArray = [], searchedTickersArray  = [];

    tickersPane.loadingTickersDone = false;

    switch(type) {
        case 'searched':
            ....
            break;

        case 'portfolio':

            if (portfolioCached) {
                // The API Call (cached)
                ApiFactory.getWatchList().then(function(data) {
                    portfolioTickersArray = renderTickers(data.data.tickers, undefined, type);
                    portfolioTickers.that = portfolioTickersArray;
                    tickersPane.loadingTickersDone = true;
                    console.log('portfolioTickersArray: ', portfolioTickersArray);
                    return portfolioTickersArray;
                });

            } else {
                // The API Call (not cached)
                ApiFactory.getWatchListRefresh().then(function(data) {
                    portfolioTickersArray = renderTickers(data.data.tickers, undefined, type);
                    portfolioTickers.that = portfolioTickersArray;
                    portfolioCached = true;
                    tickersPane.loadingTickersDone = true;
                    console.log('portfolioTickersArray: ', portfolioTickersArray);
                    return portfolioTickersArray;
                });
            }
            break;
    }

    function renderTickers(data, searchedTicker, type) {
        ....
    }
}
 The return Array function I'm using inside of the getTickersFactory.js I believe I shouldn't use this however and figure out how to use promises instead: function returnPortfolioTickers() {
    return portfolioTickers.that;
}
 Note I did originally try this, but with the same results: vs.tickers = GetTickersFactory.getTickers('portfolio');
 vs.tickers would return undefined
@CODE:Array $q vs.tickers console.log if (root.tickerType === 'portfolio') {

    // Call to factory to start the API GETS:
    GetTickersFactory.getTickers('portfolio');

    // I then call a function in the Factory to return the array
    // Which isn't ready yet of course since it returns undefined...
    vs.tickers = GetTickersFactory.returnPortfolioTickers();

    console.log('portfolio');
    console.log('vs.tickers = ', vs.tickers);
} function getTickers(type, load, searchedTicker) {
    load = load || loadString; searchedTicker = searchedTicker || '';

    var portfolioTickersArray = [], searchedTickersArray  = [];

    tickersPane.loadingTickersDone = false;

    switch(type) {
        case 'searched':
            ....
            break;

        case 'portfolio':

            if (portfolioCached) {
                // The API Call (cached)
                ApiFactory.getWatchList().then(function(data) {
                    portfolioTickersArray = renderTickers(data.data.tickers, undefined, type);
                    portfolioTickers.that = portfolioTickersArray;

@TITLE:How to call REC Registery API and store returned JSONs into some kind of database
@CONTENT:I'd like to break this into smaller, tighter questions but I don't know what I don't know enough to do that yet. So hopefully a can get specific answers to help do that. The scope of the solution requires receiving & parsing a lot of records, 2013 had ~17 million certificate(s) transactions while I'm only interested in very small subsets of the order 40,000 records. In pseudo code: iterate dates(thisDate) send message to API for thisDate receive JSONS as todaysRecords examine todaysRecords to look for whatever criteria match inside the structure append a subset of todaysRecords to recordsOut save recordsOut to a SQL/CSV file. There's a large database of Renewable Energy Certificates for the use under the Australian Government RET Scheme called the REC Registery and as well as the web interface linked to here, there is an API provided that has a simple call logic as follows http://rec-registry.gov.au/rec-registry/app/api/public-register/certificate-actions?date=<user provided date> where: The date part of the URL should be provided by the user Date format should be YYYY-MM-DD (no angle brackets & 1 date limit) A JSON is returned (with potentially 100,000s of records on each day). The API documentation (13pp PDF) is here, but it mainly goes into explaining the elements of the returned structure which is less relevant to my question. Includes two sample JSON responses. While I know some Javascript (mostly not in a web context) I'm not sure how send this message within a script and figure I'd need to do it server side to be able to process (filter) the returned information and then save the records I'm interested in. I'll have no issue parsing the JSON (if i can use JS) and copying the objects I wish to save I'm not sure where to even start doing this. Do I need a LAMP setup to do this (or MAMP since I'm on OS X) or is there a more light-weight JS way I can execute this. I've never known how to save file from within web-browser JS, I thought it was banned for security reasons but I guess theres ways and means. If i can rewrite this question to be more clear and effective in soliciting an answer I'm happy for edits to question also. I guess maybe I'm after some boilerplate code for calling a simple API like this and the stack or application context in which I need to do it. I realise there's potential several ways to execute this but looking for most straightforward for someone with JS knowledge and not much PHP/Python experience (but willing to learn what it takes). Easy right?

@TITLE:Google Webmasters API for Java returns empty site list
@CONTENT:I have written a simple site list query code which uses Oauth with service account based on Google's documentation. The authentication key file (.p12) being used is valid as well as the account. The problem is that sites list method returns an empty list. service.sites().list().execute();
 Also if I explicitly try to get sitemaps of a validated site, by calling service.sitemaps().list("my.sample.site.com").execute();
 I got a 403 Forbidden - "User does not have sufficient permission for site 'sample.site.com'. See also: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2451999." error from the API. According to my debugging, the API perfectly loads the key file (.p12) and manages the access tokens etc. with no problems. Nevertheless there might be a problem with my service account authentication. Dependencies: <dependency>

@TITLE:MaybeT and Transactions in runDb
@CONTENT:For my previous question on chaining failures, Michael Snoyman had suggested I use MaybeT to run them so if any of them fails, it will just short-circuit to Nothing. I was under the impression runDb runs everything in a transaction. So shouldn't a failure at any point in code automatically rollback the transaction? mauth <- runDb $ runMaybeT $ do
            valid    <- MaybeT $ return $ listToMaybe errs 
            uid      <- MaybeT $ insertUnique u 
            vid     <- MaybeT $ getBy $ UniqueField v -- this step fails but previous insert does not roll back
            auth     <- liftIO $ createAuthToken uid
            return auth
 When I run the above code, the getBy fails but user was still inserted. Am I misunderstanding that runDb will rollback on a Nothing inside MaybeT? Do I need to use some other Monad for this to work? Appreciate your thoughts on how to best rollback on failure. Update: This is what I ended up doing per Michael's suggestion. mauth <- runDb $ do
          ma <- runMaybeT $ do
                   valid <- ... 
          case ma of
            Just _ -> return ma
            Nothing -> liftIO $ throwIO MyException
 Now I need to figure out how to catch this exception nicely outside and return a proper error message back. Thanks!

@TITLE:How to find the least common multiple of a range of numbers?
@CONTENT:Given an array of two numbers, let them define the start and end of a range of numbers. For example, [2,6] means the range 2,3,4,5,6. I want to write javascript code to find the least common multiple for the range. My code below works for small ranges only, not something like [1,13] (which is the range 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13), which causes a stack overflow. How can I efficiently find the least common multiple of a range? function leastCommonMultiple(arr) {
    var minn, max;
    if ( arr[0] > arr[1] ) {
        minn = arr[1];
        max = arr[0];

        minn = arr[0];
        max = arr[1];
    }
    function repeatRecurse(min, max, scm) {
        if ( scm % min === 0 && min < max ) {
            return repeatRecurse(min+1, max, scm);
        } else if ( scm % min !== 0 && min < max ) {
            return repeatRecurse(minn, max, scm+max);

 I want all my arrays to create an hash in which there are keys containing the different classes that are in my Array. Their values will be the actual elements for each class. So it would look like this: {Fixnum=>[4, 3, 7], String=>["hello", "seven"], Symbol=>[:d, :a]}
 I want to solve the whole thing without using flatten, but doing it recrusive. Te flatten solution could look like this: def deep_collect_by_elem_type_as_hash1()
    e = {}
    flat= self.flatten()
    flat.each(){|x|

      end
    }
    return e
  end
 For those wondering why I do not want to use flatten: I still have problems fully understanding how to implement recursive methods, and therefore this is a question to give me a better understanding. I think I somehow have to implement merge with a block, but I cannot figure out a proper block. merge(x.deep_collect_by_elem_type_as_hash(){|k,v1,v2| help}

 The problem is I'm not sure how to convert sections like that into readable text. I get the API is calling a link between a class and its properties using unique IDs but I'm still stuck. Is this actually possible at present or am I barking up the wrong tree?

@LINK:/questions/31264607/using-graphicbuffers-to-fast-read-from-a-texture
@TITLE:Using GraphicBuffers to fast read from a texture
@CONTENT:I am working on some code that runs some GPGPU code on Android using shaders. Usually a Framebuffer is used so the result of the computation is stored in a texture. Also the input data is usually a texture. To improve performance it would be great to get rid of glTexImage2D and glReadPixels to upload and download images to and from the GPU memory space. All the code related to OpenGL is native. On Android GraphicBuffer can be used on Android for this propose because in mobile devices gpu memory is just host RAM memory. This structure allows to use memcpy to transfer data with the GPU. This should be faster than using OpenGL functions. I have been using this very cited articles [1][2][3] to successfully upload textures to the Android's GPU memory space using GraphicBuffer. Later I tried to use the same method to move the texture data back into CPU space but I'm still having some problems with it. According to answer [7] it should not be possible. But further reading of some other answers in StackOverflow seem to tell otherwise. Some cases of a successful replacement of glReadPixels by a memcpy from a GraphicBuffer are reported in [4][5][6]. Most seem to say that placing glFinish just before locking and reading the GraphicBuffer makes its content updated as expected by the time it is read. In my experience it did not work out of the box but there really seem to be a timing problem. Just calling glFinish does not seem to be enough but if I wait a few milliseconds before reading the buffer (i.e. placing a sleep) then the content seem to be correct. This is really not a solution as it ends up being slower than the original glReadPixels solution (and anyway it wouldn't be a very reliable solution), but shows that the content IS actually updated at some point. My questions would be: Is it really true that GraphicBuffer can not be read directly as said in [7], or has something changed since then? Is it just a coincidence that it seem to work for other people? Is there a better way to enforce the memory to be updated (e.g. a stronger glFinish call)?

@CONTENT:Does anyone have any idea how to go about getting "Shared with Everyone" information from SharePoint and OneDrive for business? I've been scratching my head for a few days trying to figure it out, but I'm having no luck. What I need to do is create a report of any users in our Office 365 tenant that have files in their "Shared with Everyone" folder. If anyone could even point me in the right direction, I'd certainly appreciate it. I'm a fair hand with PowerShell, but that isn't even helping much. Thank you!

    public long execute(Realm realm, long l) {
        l += 1;
        return l;
    }

        table.addColumn(ColumnType.INTEGER, "key");
        table.addColumn(ColumnType.STRING, "value");
        table.setPrimaryKey("key");
        version += 1;
    }

    return version;

And on his website, he says that the answer is 2, however I can't understand how to achieve 2, because to remove maximum we need to first exchange the max element with the last one, decrease N, and then sink the last one down from the top into its place, which takes logN exchanges. So, how do you achieve 2? Exchange & remove-max: Then we need to sink, that L node, which means we need do logN more exchanges.

@TITLE:Redefinition inconsistency in clang between struct and int
@CONTENT:The following program gives no error when compiling with clang: namespace X {
    struct i {};
}

namespace Y {
    using X::i;
    struct i {};
}

int main() {}
 Let's use int instead of struct, then we get: namespace X {
    int i;
}

namespace Y {
    using X::i;
    int i;
}

int main() {}
 This program gives a redefinition error when compiling with clang. The only difference between the programs is the kind of entity used (struct or int), but one compiles without errors and the other gives a redefinition error. Does this indicate a bug in clang? Maybe the standard is ambiguous what a redefinition is when it comes to using-declarations. But shouldn't a compiler make its interpretation consistently? The programs can be compiled here: http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/Cixqs9EJcxeYb53E http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/QmZ8ehXyozvKnZST

@TITLE:Clone draggable after dropping in targeted area with jQuery UI
@CONTENT:I want some images to drop in a targeted area as many times as possible. But the image drops for only one time. My jQuery UI code:  $(function() {
    $( ".draggable img").draggable({ 
        revert: "invalid",
        appendTo: "#droppable",
        helper: "clone"

    $( "#droppable" ).droppable({

           var image = $(".ui-draggable");
           $( "<img />" ).image.src.appendTo( this );
        }
    });
});
 Please see the demonstration here: jsFiddle example From the example you see that the image drops in the div area only the first time. But I want the user to have the ability to drag and drop the same image as many times as they want in the targeted area. So for example a user can drag and drop the image 5 times and there will be 5 images cloned in the targeted area. How can I do that?
@CODE:$(function() {
    $( ".draggable img").draggable({ 
        revert: "invalid",
        appendTo: "#droppable",
        helper: "clone"

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use streams to send data to the browser with Hapi, but can't figure our how. Specifically I am using the request module. According to the docs the reply object accepts a stream so I have tried: reply(request.get('https://google.com'));
 The throws an error. In the docs it says the stream object must be compatible with streams2, so then I tried: reply(streams2(request.get('https://google.com')));
 Now that does not throw a server side error, but in the browser the request never loads (using chrome). I then tried this: var stream = request.get('https://google.com');
stream.on('data', data => console.log(data));
reply(streams2(stream));
 And in the console data was outputted, so I know the stream is not the issue, but rather Hapi. How can I get streaming in Hapi to work?
@CODE:reply reply(request.get('https://google.com')); reply(streams2(request.get('https://google.com'))); var stream = request.get('https://google.com');

My JSON response returns the resized image url (set by 'url' in the response) and that is the image that is shown in the CKEditor window after the successful file upload. But the img tag inserted has the height and width attributes set with the values from the original image, not my resized image. Is there a way to return the new height and width values? Or does anyone have an idea of how to hack around this? And more generally, is there any resource which describes all possible values in the JSON response?

CodeSign error: code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 8.3' EDIT: I managed to build the product for archive and then I tried to go on XCode->Archives and selected "submit to app store" as well as "export" and Save for Ad Hoc Deployment. But in both cases I get the error shown below: A colleague was telling me that the only way to solve this problems is sometimes to delete all the key/certificates in the keychain and recreate them all. However I don't really want to go down this route as I got several and it would be a pain (spending then days to reconfigure all the other XCode projects I got...). I have made sure that I recreated and re-imported the developer and distribution profile for this test. The purpose is to create a build that I can submit to iTunes connect and then distribute via TestFlight. The iTunes connect record exists and I am following the apple guide on this. This is driving me crazy :-)... Same happens when I choose "use local signing assets".

@TITLE:Is it possible to have dead letter queue for individual queues
@CONTENT:I currently have a Queue in my ActiveMQ server called hello.world. Whenever a message fails to be processed, ActiveMQ creates a default directory called ActiveMQ.DLQ. Is it possible to change that name to something like hello.world.DLQ? The reason being is that I might have several queues in the future and I want it to be something like <queue_name>.DLQ
@CODE:hello.world ActiveMQ.DLQ hello.world.DLQ <queue_name>.DLQ

@TITLE:How-to: Grails 3.0.2 + Oracle Database 12c?
@CONTENT:I am making my first steps with Grails and try to create a hello world application with an Oracle Database 12c. Unfortunately the tutorial documentation on the database specific part at www.grails.org seems not that comprehensive (in contrast for example to that of Ruby on Rails, which I used now several years) - especially when it comes to non-H2 databases. Is there some recent tutorial on how to get a Grails 3.0.2 app up and running with an Oracle Database 12c? Mainly I am interested on a) where to put the corresponding JDBC driver and b) how the database configuration should look like. For a) grails.org talks about a "lib" directory but does not explain, where it exists or should be created. Other sources say, that the "lib" directory is outdated since several Grails versions and that JDBC drivers should be loaded via dependencies from some repositories - which is obviously not possible with the closed-source Oracle JDBC driver. For b) Currently, I have created basic database configuration at <my-app>/grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy for Oracle 12c: dataSource {
        url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@my-server:my-port:my-sid"
        driverClassName = "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"
        dialect = "Oracle10gDialect"
        username = "my-user"
        password = "my-pass"
}
 Should that be enough for a simple hello world app? Everything I have found so far at the web is outdated either on the Grails side (covering versions 2.x oder 1.x) and/or the Oracle side (covering versions 10* oder 11*). Thanks for any hints! Update (just for the record and to bring together the comments below): 1) Edit <myapp>/grails-app/conf/application.yml. hibernate:
    jdbc:
        use_get_generated_keys: true
(...)
dataSource:
    pooled: true
    jmxExport: true
    driverClassName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
    username: <myuser>
    password: <mypassword>
(...)
environments:
    development:
        dataSource:
            dbCreate: create
            url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@<myserver>:<myport>:<mysid>
(...)
 2) Get the corresponding Oracle JDBC driver that fits your JDK and Oracle DB release. In my case (openJDK 7 + Oracle 12c) this was ojdbc7.jar release 12.1.0.2.0 from the Oracle Website: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index.html 3) Place this JDBC driver in <myapp>/lib (create this directory, if it does not yet exists). 4) Add details of this JDBC driver to the dependencies section of <myapp>/build.gradle (modify if necessary to fit your environment/releases): (...)
dependencies {
    (...)
    runtime "com.oracle.ojdbc7:12.1.0.2.0" 
    (...)
}
(...)
 5) Create a Maven artifact (modify if necessary to fit your environment/releases): mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/ojdbc7.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc7 -Dversion=12.1.0.2.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
 6) Add the path to the JDBC driver to your CLASSPATH: export CLASSPATH=/<somewhere>/<myapp>/lib/ojdbc7.jar 7) Enjoy ...

@TITLE:Sending form with POST method and Polymer iron-form?
@CONTENT:i use Polymer starter kit 1.0.2 and i'm trying to use iron-form based on (little) documentation i found. My method form is "post" and contain only one input. My form "action" is a PHP script (add.php) showing content of $_GET and $_POST: print_r($_POST);
print_r($_GET);
 My form component (form_eclp.html) is: <dom-module id="my-form">
    <template>
        <div class="horizontal center-center layout">
            <div>

        function clickHandler(event) {
            Polymer.dom(event).localTarget.parentElement.submit();
        }

        Polymer({
            is: 'my-form',
            listeners: {
                'iron-form-response': 'formResponse'
            },
            formResponse: function(e) {
                // ?????????
            }
        });
    </script>
</dom-module>
 I call if from: <link rel="import" href="form_eclp.html">
<my-form></my-form>
 When i click the submit button after entering the text 'test' in name input, i can see in the network tab of the browser developper tools that it's a POST request, ok, but the url is add.php?name=test, and in the response tab i have: Array
(
)
Array
(
    [name] => test
)
 According to my form action (add.php script), first array is for $_POST and the second $_GET. I can see, despite form method="post", it's a "get" request because only $_GET is populated, there is nothing in $_POST. I don't understand, is it a bug ?

print_r($_GET); <dom-module id="my-form">

@TITLE:Javascript ES6 computational/time complexity of collections
@CONTENT:What time complexity (in big-O notation) is provided by the ES6 specification for the Keyed Collections (Set, Map, WeakSet, and WeakMap)? My expectation, and I expect that of most developers, is that the specifications and implementations would use widely accepted performant algorithms, in which case Set.prototype.has, add and delete to all be O(1) in the average case. The same for the Map and Weak¡V equivalents. It is not entirely apparent to me whether the time complexity of the implementations was mandated e.g. in ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification - 6th Edition ¡X 23.2 Set Objects. Unless I misunderstand it (and it's certainly very possible I do), it looks the ECMA spec mandates that the implementations (e.g. Set.prototype.has) are to use a linear time (O(n)) algorithm. It would strike me as exceedingly surprising that more performant algorithms would not be mandated or even permitted by the spec, and I would be very interested in an explanation for why this is the case.

@TITLE:params.getBehaviour() returns null value
@CONTENT:I was playing with the new Android Design Library. The CollapsingToolbarLayout works perfectly. However, I am having trouble setting default state of toolbar as Collapsed. I am trying to implement the solution shown here and here I am calling following code in my onResume of Activity:    CoordinatorLayout.LayoutParams params = (CoordinatorLayout.LayoutParams) appBarLayout.getLayoutParams();
    AppBarLayout.Behavior behavior = (AppBarLayout.Behavior) params.getBehavior();
    if(behavior!=null)
    {
        Log.d("DEBUG", "Behaviour is Not Null ");
        int[] consumed = new int[2];
        behavior.onNestedPreScroll(coordinator, appBarLayout, null, 0, 1000,consumed);
//      behavior.onNestedFling(coordinator, appBarLayout, null, 0, 10000, true);
     }
     else
          Log.d("DEBUG", "Behaviour is Null " );
 However, the behaviour returned by params is null. My xml is code same as here, except i am not using drawer and CordinatorLayout is my root Layout. EDIT: I earlier tried switching AppBarLayout.Behavior to AppBarLayout.ScrollingViewBehavior and setting layout_behavior for AppBarLayout to @string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior, but it resulted in weird layout. Robin's answer works nicely. To Complement that, the behavior can also set in xml using following tag in AppBarLayout: app:layout_behavior="android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout$Behavior"
@CODE:CoordinatorLayout.LayoutParams params = (CoordinatorLayout.LayoutParams) appBarLayout.getLayoutParams();
    AppBarLayout.Behavior behavior = (AppBarLayout.Behavior) params.getBehavior();
    if(behavior!=null)
    {
        Log.d("DEBUG", "Behaviour is Not Null ");
        int[] consumed = new int[2];
        behavior.onNestedPreScroll(coordinator, appBarLayout, null, 0, 1000,consumed);
//      behavior.onNestedFling(coordinator, appBarLayout, null, 0, 10000, true);
     }
     else
          Log.d("DEBUG", "Behaviour is Null " ); app:layout_behavior="android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout$Behavior"

@TITLE:Append list variable to another list in Ansible
@CONTENT:is it possible to append a variable list to a static list in ansible? I can define the whole list as a variable: my_list:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
 and then use it in a playbook as something: {{my_list}}
 But I cannot seem to find how to do this (pseudo code): list_to_append: 
  - 3
  - 4
 and then in the playbook: something:
  - 1
  - 2
  - {{append: list_to_append}}
 If that is in fact impossible, what would you suggest for my use case? I have a list of items in a parameter but some of them are optional and should be modifiable using variables. In other words: I have default values + optional values that could or could not be added via variables. The optional values are not known in advance, I could add 1, 2 or 100 of them, so they are not static. I basically have a default static list ++ a configurable variable list to append. thank you edit: I found this but it's only for with_items and I need it in a normal parameter:   with_flattened:
   - "{{list1}}"
   - "{{list2}}"
@CODE:my_list:
  - 1

@CONTENT:I'm stuck trying to select one instance from many at runtime. Really is a kind of Backend. I'm able to do it if I select one instance or other at compile time. UPDATED probably I want some similar to Database.Persist (it define a fully behavior but many instances: mongodb, sqlite, postgresql, ...). But is too complex to me.

  var app = new AppObject { bee = makeOneOrOtherBehavior(); }
....
 I've tried many ways (and lots of extensions :D) but none works. Informally I want to define one class with certain behavior and use this generic definition into some application, after it, select at runtime one instance from some. The generic behavior (not real code) class Behavior k a where
  behavior :: k -> IO ()
  foo :: k -> a -> Bool
  ...
 (I think k is needed since each instance could need their own context/data; other restrictions like key/value may be exist) Two instances data BehaviorA
instance Behavior BehaviorA where
  behavior _ = print "Behavior A!"

data BehaviorB

  behavior _ = print "Behavior B!"

@TITLE:High performance variable blurring in very big images using Python
@CONTENT:I have a large collection of large images (ex. 15000x15000 pixels) that I would like to blur. I need to blur the images using a distance function, so the further away I move from some areas in the image the more heavier the blurring should be. I have a distance map describing how far a given pixel is from the areas. Due to the large amount of images I have to consider performance. I have looked at NumPY/SciPY, they have some great functions but they seem to use a fixed kernel size and I need to reduce or increase the kernel size depending on the distance to the previous mentioned areas. How can I solve this problem in python? UPDATE: My solution so far based on the answer by rth: # cython: boundscheck=False
# cython: cdivision=True
# cython: wraparound=False

import numpy as np
cimport numpy as np

def variable_average(int [:, ::1] data, int[:,::1] kernel_size):
    cdef int width, height, i, j, ii, jj
    width = data.shape[1]
    height = data.shape[0]
    cdef double [:, ::1] data_blurred = np.empty([width, height])
    cdef double res

    for i in range(width):
        for j in range(height):
            weight = 0
            res = 0
            sigma =  kernel_size[i, j]
            for ii in range(i - sigma, i + sigma + 1):
                for jj in range(j - sigma, j + sigma + 1):
                    if ii < 0 or ii >= width or jj < 0 or jj >= height:
                        continue
                    res += data[ii, jj]
                    weight += 1
            data_blurred[i, j] = res/weight

kernel = np.random.randint(256, size=(1024,1024)) + 1
result = np.asarray(variable_average(data, kernel))
 The method using the above settings takes around 186seconds to run. Is that what I can expect to ultimately squeeze out of the method or are there optimizations that I can use to further increase the performance (still using Python)?

@TITLE:In java, what does such class type compile to?
@CONTENT:Below is the code that defines class type: package annotationtype;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args){


    }
}
 that gets functionally compiled by javac to: public class annotationtype.Example{
    public static Class<annotationtype.Example> class;
    {
        class = Class.forName("annotationtype.Example")
    }
    public annotationtype.Example(){}
    public static void main(java.lang.String[] args){}
}
 My major focus is on the Class<annotationtype.Example> class static member variable in the above code. In addition, this member variable Class<annotationtype.Example> class is actually pointing to an object of type class Class that maintains meta data of class Example after class Example gets loaded into memory. Is my understanding correct?
@CODE:class package annotationtype;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args){


    }
} javac public class annotationtype.Example{
    public static Class<annotationtype.Example> class;

@TITLE:Is implementing LMS Scorm Tracking without an authoring package feasible for a beginner?
@CONTENT:Prior to building an eLearning solution, I am determining whether to use an authoring package such as Captivate or Storyline or to create HTML pages which utilize JS calls for tracking. If I avoid using an authoring tool, I get flexibility in terms of the content and reuse of existing assets. For example, Storyline is outputting SWF files which I cannot pass around my team like a simple HTML page for review. However, I am new to SCORM.. and I am wondering is it feasible to get up to speed with implementing SCORM LMS tracking JS calls along with my custom HTML pages, or would the preferable approach be to start with an authoring tool?

@TITLE:Apple id account belonging to two teams getting ¡§Your account already has a valid iOS Distribution certificate¡¨
@CONTENT:Assumption: this should not be a duplicate question of this, but however is somehow related. I got an apple id associated to two different teams and I get the following error: This Q/A is not useful for me because it relates to having 2 different app ids. I cannot be removed from one of the two teams and I am pretty sure that there must be a way to be able to fix this. I tried exporting/importing and recreating the developer profile but none of these options helps. I incur in this error when I choose Product->Archive and set my code signing identity to iOS Distribution. I created the iOS Distribution profile and installed it locally.. however the build error say that: Code Sign error: No code signing identities found: No valid signing identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair) matching the team ID ¡§xxxxxxxxxxxxxx¡¨ were found. CodeSign error: code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 8.3' EDIT: I managed to build the product for archive and then I tried to go on XCode->Archives and selected "submit to app store" as well as "export" and Save for Ad Hoc Deployment. But in both cases I get the error shown below: A colleague was telling me that the only way to solve this problems is sometimes to delete all the key/certificates in the keychain and recreate them all. However I don't really want to go down this route as I got several and it would be a pain (spending then days to reconfigure all the other XCode projects I got...). I have made sure that I recreated and re-imported the developer and distribution profile for this test. The purpose is to create a build that I can submit to iTunes connect and then distribute via TestFlight. The iTunes connect record exists and I am following the apple guide on this. This is driving me crazy :-)... Same happens when I choose "use local signing assets".

["1","2","10"],
["4","5"],
["8","9","11"]

 I need to match all the values inside a nested array but only one of the nested arrays needs to be a match for the document to be a match. So, in this example only the second nested array is a match because "4" and "5" are both present in the search array (therefore my document is a match). What kind of query should I use to achieve this?

@LINK:/questions/31126177/how-to-grails-3-0-2-oracle-database-12c
@TITLE:How-to: Grails 3.0.2 + Oracle Database 12c?
@CONTENT:I am making my first steps with Grails and try to create a hello world application with an Oracle Database 12c. Unfortunately the tutorial documentation on the database specific part at www.grails.org seems not that comprehensive (in contrast for example to that of Ruby on Rails, which I used now several years) - especially when it comes to non-H2 databases. Is there some recent tutorial on how to get a Grails 3.0.2 app up and running with an Oracle Database 12c? Mainly I am interested on a) where to put the corresponding JDBC driver and b) how the database configuration should look like. For a) grails.org talks about a "lib" directory but does not explain, where it exists or should be created. Other sources say, that the "lib" directory is outdated since several Grails versions and that JDBC drivers should be loaded via dependencies from some repositories - which is obviously not possible with the closed-source Oracle JDBC driver. For b) Currently, I have created basic database configuration at <my-app>/grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy for Oracle 12c: dataSource {
        url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@my-server:my-port:my-sid"
        driverClassName = "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"
        dialect = "Oracle10gDialect"
        username = "my-user"
        password = "my-pass"
}
 Should that be enough for a simple hello world app? Everything I have found so far at the web is outdated either on the Grails side (covering versions 2.x oder 1.x) and/or the Oracle side (covering versions 10* oder 11*). Thanks for any hints! Update (just for the record and to bring together the comments below): 1) Edit <myapp>/grails-app/conf/application.yml. hibernate:
    jdbc:
        use_get_generated_keys: true
(...)
dataSource:
    pooled: true
    jmxExport: true
    driverClassName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
    username: <myuser>
    password: <mypassword>
(...)

        dataSource:
            dbCreate: create
            url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@<myserver>:<myport>:<mysid>
(...)
 2) Get the corresponding Oracle JDBC driver that fits your JDK and Oracle DB release. In my case (openJDK 7 + Oracle 12c) this was ojdbc7.jar release 12.1.0.2.0 from the Oracle Website: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index.html 3) Place this JDBC driver in <myapp>/lib (create this directory, if it does not yet exists). 4) Add details of this JDBC driver to the dependencies section of <myapp>/build.gradle (modify if necessary to fit your environment/releases): (...)
dependencies {
    (...)
    runtime "com.oracle.ojdbc7:12.1.0.2.0" 
    (...)
}
(...)
 5) Create a Maven artifact (modify if necessary to fit your environment/releases): mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/ojdbc7.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc7 -Dversion=12.1.0.2.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
 6) Add the path to the JDBC driver to your CLASSPATH: export CLASSPATH=/<somewhere>/<myapp>/lib/ojdbc7.jar 7) Enjoy ...

@CONTENT:I want to implement a layout in which the action bar is below an image. And, on sliding the screen up, the actionbar should also move up, along with the image. The action bar should then go to the topmost point of the screen and stop. This is implemented in many apps like the grofers app. I don't mind using an external library for the same. Thanks.

@TITLE:Javascript ES6 computational/time complexity of collections
@CONTENT:What time complexity (in big-O notation) is provided by the ES6 specification for the Keyed Collections (Set, Map, WeakSet, and WeakMap)? My expectation, and I expect that of most developers, is that the specifications and implementations would use widely accepted performant algorithms, in which case Set.prototype.has, add and delete to all be O(1) in the average case. The same for the Map and Weak¡V equivalents. It is not entirely apparent to me whether the time complexity of the implementations was mandated e.g. in ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification - 6th Edition ¡X 23.2 Set Objects. Unless I misunderstand it (and it's certainly very possible I do), it looks the ECMA spec mandates that the implementations (e.g. Set.prototype.has) are to use a linear time (O(n)) algorithm. It would strike me as exceedingly surprising that more performant algorithms would not be mandated or even permitted by the spec, and I would be very interested in an explanation for why this is the case.

@TITLE:params.getBehaviour() returns null value
@CONTENT:I was playing with the new Android Design Library. The CollapsingToolbarLayout works perfectly. However, I am having trouble setting default state of toolbar as Collapsed. I am trying to implement the solution shown here and here I am calling following code in my onResume of Activity:    CoordinatorLayout.LayoutParams params = (CoordinatorLayout.LayoutParams) appBarLayout.getLayoutParams();
    AppBarLayout.Behavior behavior = (AppBarLayout.Behavior) params.getBehavior();

     }
     else
          Log.d("DEBUG", "Behaviour is Null " );
 However, the behaviour returned by params is null. My xml is code same as here, except i am not using drawer and CordinatorLayout is my root Layout. EDIT: I earlier tried switching AppBarLayout.Behavior to AppBarLayout.ScrollingViewBehavior and setting layout_behavior for AppBarLayout to @string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior, but it resulted in weird layout. Robin's answer works nicely. To Complement that, the behavior can also set in xml using following tag in AppBarLayout: app:layout_behavior="android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout$Behavior"

@CONTENT:is it possible to append a variable list to a static list in ansible? I can define the whole list as a variable: my_list:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
 and then use it in a playbook as something: {{my_list}}
 But I cannot seem to find how to do this (pseudo code): list_to_append: 
  - 3
  - 4
 and then in the playbook: something:
  - 1
  - 2
  - {{append: list_to_append}}
 If that is in fact impossible, what would you suggest for my use case? I have a list of items in a parameter but some of them are optional and should be modifiable using variables. In other words: I have default values + optional values that could or could not be added via variables. The optional values are not known in advance, I could add 1, 2 or 100 of them, so they are not static. I basically have a default static list ++ a configurable variable list to append. thank you edit: I found this but it's only for with_items and I need it in a normal parameter:   with_flattened:
   - "{{list1}}"
   - "{{list2}}"

  behavior :: k -> IO ()
  foo :: k -> a -> Bool

@LINK:/questions/31021166/high-performance-variable-blurring-in-very-big-images-using-python
@TITLE:High performance variable blurring in very big images using Python
@CONTENT:I have a large collection of large images (ex. 15000x15000 pixels) that I would like to blur. I need to blur the images using a distance function, so the further away I move from some areas in the image the more heavier the blurring should be. I have a distance map describing how far a given pixel is from the areas. Due to the large amount of images I have to consider performance. I have looked at NumPY/SciPY, they have some great functions but they seem to use a fixed kernel size and I need to reduce or increase the kernel size depending on the distance to the previous mentioned areas. How can I solve this problem in python? UPDATE: My solution so far based on the answer by rth: # cython: boundscheck=False
# cython: cdivision=True
# cython: wraparound=False

import numpy as np
cimport numpy as np

def variable_average(int [:, ::1] data, int[:,::1] kernel_size):
    cdef int width, height, i, j, ii, jj
    width = data.shape[1]
    height = data.shape[0]
    cdef double [:, ::1] data_blurred = np.empty([width, height])
    cdef double res
    cdef int sigma, weight

    for i in range(width):
        for j in range(height):
            weight = 0
            res = 0
            sigma =  kernel_size[i, j]
            for ii in range(i - sigma, i + sigma + 1):
                for jj in range(j - sigma, j + sigma + 1):
                    if ii < 0 or ii >= width or jj < 0 or jj >= height:
                        continue
                    res += data[ii, jj]
                    weight += 1
            data_blurred[i, j] = res/weight

    return data_blurred
 Test: data = np.random.randint(256, size=(1024,1024))
kernel = np.random.randint(256, size=(1024,1024)) + 1
result = np.asarray(variable_average(data, kernel))
 The method using the above settings takes around 186seconds to run. Is that what I can expect to ultimately squeeze out of the method or are there optimizations that I can use to further increase the performance (still using Python)?

@TITLE:How can I create an internal spiral for a polygon?
@CONTENT:For any shape how can I create a spiral inside it of a similar shape. This would be a similar idea to bounding (using Minkowski sum). Rather than creating the same shape inside the shape though it would be a spiral of same shape. I found this - http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/13su/lectures/Spiral.java It creates a spiral based on the parameters passed so it can be for any regular shape. I want the above for all shapes i.e. irregular polygons too. I am not hugely familiar with geometric terminology but I have looked up Involutes and an Internal Spiral Search Algorithm too but haven't been useful to me. Does anyone have any idea where I'd find an algorithm such as this or at least ideas of how I'd come up with one?

@TITLE:Why does XGrabKey return BadRequest?
@CONTENT:So I'm working on a Gtk/X11/Linux app that does screen capture to .gif and one of the methods of stopping the capture is a key press (Esc, Space or End). You can also use a timeout. However to implement the key press to end capture I have to be able to grab the key such that I can get an event even though my window doesn't have focus (it's actually invisible during capture). I believe XGrabKey is the right X11 function for this task: Window w = Gtk::gdk_x11_drawable_get_xid(Gtk::gtk_widget_get_window(Handle()));
KeyCode kc = XKeysymToKeycode(Gtk::gdk_display, HotKeyCode);
int r = XGrabKey(   Gtk::gdk_display,
                    kc,
                    0               /* modifiers */,
                    w               /* grab_window */,
                    TRUE            /* owner_events */,
                    GrabModeAsync   /* pointer_mode */,
                    GrabModeAsync   /* keyboard_mode */);
printf("XGrabKey(%p, 0x%x/%x)=%i\n", w, HotKeyCode, kc, r);
 Where 'HotKeyCode' is say XK_Escape or something e.g.: XGrabKey(0x3e00003, 0xff1b/9)=1
 XGrabKey is returning '1' or BadRequest. What am I doing wrong here? FYI the actual Xorg Xserver code in question appears to be here. Edit: The latest incarnation of the code is: int x_err_callback(Display *d, XErrorEvent *e)
{
    char msg[256];

    XGetErrorText(d, e->error_code, msg, sizeof(msg));

@LINK:/questions/30994081/how-to-combine-multiple-filters-together-to-filter-task-rows-using-jquery
@TITLE:How to combine multiple FIlters together to filter Task Rows using jQuery?
@CONTENT:I have hacked together a basic example Task List Table with HTML and using jQuery. I have attached some on change events to my Filter DropDown Selection Fields Demo: http://codepen.io/jasondavis/pen/MwOwMX?editors=101 I have a Filter Selection Field for each of these: Assigned User Task Status Milestone Priority Tags Independently they all work to get the job done in filtering out non matching results from my Task List Table. For each Task Row, I store the value of each filterable option in a Data Attribute like this example Task Row HTML:       <tr id="task-3"
          class="task-list-row" 
          data-task-id="3"
          data-assigned-user="Donald"
          data-status="Not Started"
          data-milestone="Milestone 1"
          data-priority="Low"
          data-tags="Tag 3">
        <td>Task title 3</td>
        <td>11/16/2014</td>
        <td>02/29/2015</td>
        <td>Low</td>
        <td>Milestone 1</td>
        <td>Donald</td>
        <td>Tag 3</td>
      </tr>
 So the actual Text for the Task row does not matter because the Task row will not show all the properties. WHat matters is the value stored in the Task Row Data Attributes. A Task row/record with a Miledstone set to Milestone 2 will have a Data Attribute like this data-milestone="Milestone 2" An example JavaScript/jQuery Filter code: // Task Milestone Dropdown Filter
$('#milestone-filter').on('change', function() {
  var taskMilestone = this.value;

  if(taskMilestone === 'None'){
    $('.task-list-row').hide().filter(function() {
      return $(this).data('milestone') != taskMilestone;
    }).show();
  }else{
    $('.task-list-row').hide().filter(function() {
      return $(this).data('milestone') == taskMilestone;
    }).show();  
  }
});
 So as I mentioned. I can get each of my "FIlters" to work by thereself, however as soon as I try to apply more than 1 filter at a time, it will not work with this current code. I would appreciate any help in modifying my code to make a working multi-filter example please? My current demo is here: http://codepen.io/jasondavis/pen/MwOwMX?editors=101 Update Test 2 After some thought, I am thinking that perhaps I need to store all the current Filter values into variables and then on each change event instead of this:  return $(this).data('milestone') != taskMilestone;
 It would instead need to be more like this...  return $(this).data('milestone') != taskMilestone
        && $(this).data('priority') != taskPriority
        && $(this).data('tags') != taskTags
        && .... for all filters;
 Does that sound about right? Nevermind, just tried this with no luck!
@CODE:on change Filter DropDown Selection Fields Data Attribute <tr id="task-3"
          class="task-list-row" 
          data-task-id="3"
          data-assigned-user="Donald"
          data-status="Not Started"
          data-milestone="Milestone 1"
          data-priority="Low"
          data-tags="Tag 3">
        <td>Task title 3</td>
        <td>11/16/2014</td>
        <td>02/29/2015</td>
        <td>Low</td>
        <td>Milestone 1</td>
        <td>Donald</td>
        <td>Tag 3</td>
      </tr> Miledstone Milestone 2 data-milestone="Milestone 2" // Task Milestone Dropdown Filter
$('#milestone-filter').on('change', function() {
  var taskMilestone = this.value;

  if(taskMilestone === 'None'){
    $('.task-list-row').hide().filter(function() {
      return $(this).data('milestone') != taskMilestone;
    }).show();
  }else{
    $('.task-list-row').hide().filter(function() {
      return $(this).data('milestone') == taskMilestone;
    }).show();  
  }
}); change return $(this).data('milestone') != taskMilestone; return $(this).data('milestone') != taskMilestone
        && $(this).data('priority') != taskPriority
        && $(this).data('tags') != taskTags

@TITLE:How to add android expansion files using Qt
@CONTENT:I am currently developing an Android app using Qt / QML and my app will be a lot larger than the 50 MB Google Play Store limit due to media files that are to be bundled, so I have to use extension files. After some searching I found on a page a line saying that Qt resource system can help make .obb extension files: "For large resources that do not fit into the Google Play store 50 MB limit, qrc can generate rcc files that can be put in obb" but I can not find any information on how to do this or how to access those files from my code. EDIT: I have made an .rcc file using Qt. Trying to convert it to .obb now. Anyone done this using the jobb tool? I was also thinking that I could just upload the .rcc file directly as Google Play accepts any file format for expansion files, but then I would not be able to get it encrypted.. but how could I access the .rcc file? Do I have to write some Java code or could I get it to work from Qt C++/QML? EDIT: I figured it out. I created an external binary resource file using the rcc tool available in Qt command prompt. Using QResource class I can load the external binary resource file and access it as it was a normal qrc resource file.

@TITLE:Why am I getting ¡§could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle¡¨ error?
@CONTENT:This is based off my last question as well. Following this tutorial, I cloned the project into my machine and am trying to get the project to build properly. In the process of fixing the error I got in my last question, I encountered a new error. This is the section of the build script I am trying to fix/edit buildscript {

      }
 }
 Following the instructions on how to check Gradle version, I checked mine and saw that I was running Gradle version 2.2.1. Based off that, I changed     classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3'
 to    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.1'
 However after changing that build script code, and attempting to rebuild my project, I get the above mentioned error(full stack trace below)     Error:Could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.1.

 According to this question java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: org.apache.http.message.BasicLineFormatter.INSTANCE from Mashape Unirest in Java application I tried to use the following code to get the ClassLoader Ressource. ClassLoader classLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
URL resource = classLoader.getResource("org/apache/http/impl/client/HttpClientBuilder.class");
return resource;
 and it returns the following "jar:file:/some/path/WEB-INF/lib/httpclient-4.3.5.jar!/org/apache/http/impl/client/HttpClientBuilder.class"
 You can see that the jar-versions are the same. Every similar question I looked at had incoherent jar-versions as the source of failure. Could there be another reason for this error? Update After the discussion in the comments I'll update my question: Dependency tree: So now I could see the version conflict and I removed the neo-java-web-api. The classLoader now returns version 4.3.2 again. But I still get the error from the beginning. The new, complete dependency tree without the neo-java-web-api now looks like the following:

@TITLE:Why are button's discouraged from navigation*?
@CONTENT:This may be an opinionated question, but I was looking around the web and it seems like web developers like to style <a> tags to look like buttons, rather than use a specific <button> tag. I've noticeably seen this when looking at navigations After a bit of research, I found this: Buttons are not search friendly, since the text within is invisible to search engines. Buttons are harder to update than links, requiring Photoshop and a new image for every update. Buttons load more slowly that links, making them especially bad for mobile visitors. Buttons are less accessible to the visually impaired. Buttons are unnecessary, even if you want to use non-standard fonts, thanks to tools like TypeKit. ~ quoted from here However, most of these 'reasons' seems quite flimsy and answers like 'you need photoshop' seem... well... invalid? So I was wondering: Is there an actual reason why the <button> tags aren't used when creating navigation menus, and instead style <a> tags to look like buttons? Why aren't buttons the norm? Is this not what they're made for? * I do not wish for your opinion here, nor viewpoint. Only factual information as to why this is the case

    }
 This works as intended. The same code written with async/await is (obviously) simpler: async Task<T> ExecAsync<T>( string connectionString, SqlCommand cmd, Func<SqlCommand, T> resultBuilder, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken) )
{
    SqlConnectionProvider p = GetProvider( connectionString );
    using( IDisposable openTask = await p.AcquireConnectionAsync( cmd, cancellationToken ) )
    {
        await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync( cancellationToken );
        return resultBuilder( cmd );
    }
}
 I had a quick look at the generated IL for the 2 versions: the async/await is bigger (not a surprise) but I was wondering if the async/await code generator analyses the fact that a continuation is actually synchronous to use TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously where it can... and I failed to find this in the IL generated code. If anyone knows this or have any clue about it, I'd be pleased to know!
@CODE:Task<T> ExecAsync<T>( string connectionString, SqlCommand cmd, Func<SqlCommand, T> resultBuilder, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken) )
    {
        var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<T>();

@TITLE:How to incrementally iterate through all possible values of a byte array of size n?
@CONTENT:For my question n=16, but a generic answer would be appreciated too. So I have a byte array: byte[] key;
 My problem is that I want to iterate through all possible values of each element in this array, combined. I know this will take ages, and I'm not looking to actually complete this loop, just to make a loop which will at least attempt this. So e.g.: First iteration: //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
}
 Second iteration: //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
}
 Third iteration: //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
}
 Final iteration: //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255};
}
 Obviously I have just hardcoded the array above. I need a way of doing this in a proper way. Again, I know there are many different combinations. All I need is a way to start iterating through all possible values. How can I do this in my loop? I.e. what should I replace the body of my loop with, in order to iterate through all possible values of a byte array of size 16. What I have tried: In the body of the loop I have tried the following: key = new byte[16] { (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i, (byte)i };
 Obviously wrong, will only test a small subset of possible values. Will just try i= 0,...,255 and then start over for when i=256 --> (byte)i = 0. I suspect I need some more nesting. Possibly up to 16 nested loops, which sounds insane and probably wrong? I can't get my head around this problem, any help would be much appreciated! Purpose: The purpose of this question is to demonstrate how inefficient brute force cryptanalysis is in practice. The rest of my program works, I'm just stuck in this loop.
@CODE:byte[] key; //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
} //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
} //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?
byte[] key;
for(int i = 0; i < Math.Pow(2,128); i++)
{
   key = new byte[16] {2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
} //Math.Pow(2,128) is the max no. of iterations right?

@TITLE:Bluetooth LE app, how to build it cross-plaftorm (iOS-Android)?
@CONTENT:I am working on an app that talks to a Bluetooth LE device. I would like some way to avoid developing it twice, for iOS and for Android. Is there a cross-platform app framework that has good support for Bluetooth LE? I have had a quick look at frameworks like Cordova (PhoneGap), Appcelerator, Xamarin etc (the usual suspects: for example this list) but I can't figure out if they (a) support Bluetooth LE on each platform at all, and (b) if they do, whether it is via native calls (accessed how?) or some kind of wrapper to the native API (what does the wrapper look like?), and (c) if it is a wrapper, how complete it is, and how stable it is. If you have experience with these, could you summarize the status of Bluetooth LE support in different frameworks? EDIT A bit of info from digging into various options and from the answers below: Cordova: several open-source plugins, for example https://github.com/evothings/cordova-ble https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE (not a complete list). Evothings is a nice Cordova + bluetooth setup. Do these work in other Cordova-based app frameworks like Appery.io, Telerik AppBuilder, Ionic Creator? Xamarin: this just uses the native APIs via MonoTouch.CoreBluetooth and Android.Bluetooth. This means the code using them is not actually cross-platform, but they are likely to work the same as the native API (because they essentially are the native API). Appcelerator has third-party commercial plugins for Bluetooth (https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/3834 and https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/6611), no built-in support. Do these work? P.S. Besides Bluetooth my needs are pretty minimal: this app will have a lot of UI elements but not of a complicated kind, just a bunch of buttons/checkboxes/sliders on a bunch of different screens (which would be very tedious to maintain on two platforms). I'd also need to make a few calls to a REST API. Speed is not super important, there isn't that much app logic (it is mostly written in C now), and native UI look is not that important. However working on older versions of the platforms is important, ideally back to Android 4.3 and iOS 7.0.

@TITLE:How to get AWS command line interface to work in cygwin
@CONTENT:I installed the AWS command line interface on my Windows 7 box, and it worked immediately when I called commands from a DOS shell. But DOS, the worst language ever invented, is hideous for any serious scripting. So, I would like to to use the AWS CLI from bash via cygwin. In my case, the installed AWS CLI is the Windows version. In principle, that should not be a problem because Windows commands are executable from cygwin. (cygwin includes your Windows environmental variables, such as PATH, in its own environment.) Unfortunately, when I first tried to execute an AWS CLI command from cygwin/bash, I got an error: $ aws s3 cp code.tgz s3://xyz/
upload failed: .\code.tgz to s3://xyz/code.tgz
Unable to locate credentials
 This error is likely because the AWS CLI is looking in the wrong directory for the credentials file. On Windows, it expects that file to be in %UserProfile%.aws and in unix in ~/.aws. One hack work around is that in my home directory I created a new file named config_credentials which contains a union of the contents of that directory's files config and credentials. I then made a new Windows System env var named AWS_CONFIG_FILE whose value is the path to config_credentials. Success: AWS CLI commands issued from cygwin now work. I am wondering if there is a better solution? I am curious why AWS CLI initially failed to search in the correct home directory for the config and credentials files. I also wonder if there is a way to correct that (this would eliminate the need for the AWS_CONFIG_FILE env var).

@TITLE:Optimizing a slow XQuery query in BaseX
@CONTENT:I've got a BaseX XML database with only one small XML file. These file basically consists of two structures. One is PlatformCategory with 46 instances, the other one PlatformGenericType with 213 instances. PlatformGenericType has references to PlatformCategory in the href attribute. <PlatformGeneralType id="/plib/platformgeneraltypes/pgt1">
  <name>No statement</name>
  <enum>NO_STATEMENT</enum>
  <isOfPlatformCategory href="/plib/platformcategories/pc1"/>
  <readOnly>true</readOnly>
</PlatformGeneralType>

<PlatformCategory id="/plib/platformcategories/pc1">
  <name>No statement</name>
  <enum>NO_STATEMENT</enum>
  <environment>AIR</environment>
  <readOnly>true</readOnly>
</PlatformCategory>
 When I perform following query, it takes about six seconds to get the result: //PlatformGeneralType[isOfPlatformCategory/@href=//PlatformCategory[environment="AIR"]/@id]
 What can I do to optimize this query? Note that I ran "optimize all". Update: The issue on the previous query seems to be solved. But when I extends the query with following, the query takes 44,28 seconds: /PLib/PlatformSpecificTypes/PlatformSpecificType
[isOfPlatformGeneralType/@href=/PLib/PlatformGeneralTypes/PlatformGeneralType
    [isOfPlatformCategory/@href=/PLib/PlatformCategories/PlatformCategory
        [environment='AIR']/@id]/@id]
 The there are 8939 instances of PlatformSpecificType and its structure: <PlatformSpecificTypes>
    <PlatformSpecificType id="/plib/platformspecifictypes/DataShip.3">
        <name>Meko 360H2</name>
        <lethalityLevel>LOW</lethalityLevel>
        <isOfPlatformGeneralType href="/plib/platformgeneraltypes/pgt62"/>
        <ownedByCountry href="/plib/countries/10"/>
    </PlatformSpecificType>
</PlatformSpecificTypes>

 Update two: I suspect the structure of PlatformSpecificTypes prevents indexing. I am wondering if I change it as below, will it improves the query performance? <PlatformSpecificTypes>
    <PlatformSpecificType id="/plib/platformspecifictypes/DataShip.3">
        <name>Meko 360H2</name>
        <lethalityLevel>LOW</lethalityLevel>

</PlatformSpecificTypes>
 Update three: I have uploaded the XML file in a gist, so that you can inspect it. Now, when I execute following query, I takes about 28 seconds to get the result. /root/PlSpTys/PlSpTy[isOfPlGeTy/@href=/root/PlGeTys/PlGeTy[isOfPlCt/@href=/root/PlCts/PlCt[environment='AIR']/@id]/@id]

@TITLE:How to extract specific data from XML data
@CONTENT:I am using the following code snippet to parse and convert some XML data to CSV. I can convert the entire XML data and dump it into a file, however my requirements have changed and now I'm confused. public void xmlToCSVfiltered(string p, int e)
        {                 
            string all_lines1 = File.ReadAllText(p);

            doc_all.LoadXml(all_lines1);
            StreamWriter write_all = new StreamWriter(FILENAME2);
            XmlNodeList rows_all = doc_all.GetElementsByTagName("XML");

 My input looks something like the following... My objective now is to only convert those "events" and compile into a CSV which have a certain number. Lets say, for example, I only want to convert to CSV those events who's 2nd data value under element <EVENT> is 4627. It would only convert those events and in the case of the input below, both mentioned below. <XML><HEADER>1.0,770162,20121009133435,3,</HEADER>20121009133435,721,5,1,0,0,0,00:00,00:00,<EVENT>00032134826064957,4627,</EVENT><DRUG>1,1872161156,7,0,10000</DRUG><DOSE>1,0,5000000,0,10000000,0</DOSE><CAREAREA>1 </CAREAREA><ENCOUNTER></ENCOUNTER><ADVISORY>Keep it simple or spell

.. goes on
 What my approach has been so far is to convert everything to CSV and store it in some sort of data structure and then query that data structure line by line and look if that number exists and if yes, write it to a file line by line. My function takes the path of the XML file and the number we are looking for in the XML data as parameters. I'm new to C# and I cannot understand how I would go about changing my function above. Any help will be appreciated!

@TITLE:Bad Swing UI scaling on high resolution (MS Surface)
@CONTENT:I'm currently working on a little Java application, that involves Swing GUIs. On my development PC everything looks fine but when I run it on my MS Surface, some icons seem to be too large for the components (or the components too small for the icons). Here's what I mean: Google research has lead me to conclude that this is due to Surface's high resolution and Win8's zooming to let some items appear a little larger. So I reset that zoom to 100% and it actually fixed the bad scaling. Unfortunately, this doesn't really fix my problem. Everything is far too small without the zoom, so I'd rather not disable it. But is there any clever way to solve this? Can I just "unscale" my program's or Java's icons? Ideally, I would even like upscale the entire frame, because everything is rather small. Edit: obviously, I've also tried just resizing the actual JFrame but it has no effect on the dialog size. I'm calling the dialog by JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, msg, "Information", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
 by the way.

@LINK:/questions/30747633/compilers-detail-of-this-pointer-virtual-function-and-multiple-inheritance
@TITLE:compiler's detail of this pointer, virtual function and multiple-inheritance
@CONTENT:I'm reading Bjarne's paper: Multiple Inheritance for C++. In section 3, page 370, Bjarne said that "The compiler turns a call of a member function into an "ordinary" function call with an "extra" argument; that "extra" argument is a pointer to the object for which the member function is called." I'm confused by the extra this argument. Please see the following two examples: Example 1:(page 372) class A {
    int a;
    virtual void f(int);
    virtual void g(int);
    virtual void h(int);
};
class B : A {int b; void g(int); };
class C : B {int c; void h(int); };
 A class c object C looks like: C: -----------                vtbl:
+0:  vptr -------------->  -----------
+4:  a                     +0: A::f
+8:  b                     +4: B::g
+12: c                     +8: C::h
-----------                -----------  
 A call to a virtual function is transformed into an indirect call by the compiler. For example, C* pc;
pc->g(2)
 becomes something like: (*(pc->vptr[1]))(pc, 2)
 The Bjarne's paper told me the above conclusion. The passing this point is C*. In the following example, Bjarne told another story which totally confused me! Example 2:(page 373) Given two classes class A {...};
class B {...};
class C: A, B {...};
 An object of class C can be laid out as a contiguous object like this: pc-->          ----------- 
                  A part
B:bf's this--> -----------  
                  B part
               ----------- 
                  C part
               -----------
 Calling a member function of B given a C*: C* pc;
pc->bf(2); //assume that bf is a member of B and that C has no member named bf.
 Bjarne wrote: "Naturally, B::bf() expects a B* (to become its this pointer)." The compiler transforms the call into: bf__F1B((B*)((char*)pc+delta(B)), 2);
 Why here we need a B* pointer to be the this? If we just pass a *C pointer as the this, we can still access the members of B correctly I think. For example, to get the member of class B inside B::bf(), we just need to do something like: *(this+offset). this offset can be known by the compiler. Is this Right? Follow up questions for example 1 and 2: (1) When it's a linear chain derivation (example 1), why the C object can be expected to be at the same address as the B and in turn A sub-objects? There is no problem to use a C* pointer to access class B's members inside the function B::g in example 1? For example, we want to access the member b, what will happen in runtime? *(pc+8)? (2) Why can we use the same memory layout (linear chain derivation) for the multiple-inheritance? Assuming in example 2, class A, B, C have exactly the same members as the example 1. A: int a and f; B: int b and bf (or call it g); C: int c and h. Why not just use the memory layout like:  -----------               
+0:  a                     
+4:  b                    
+8: c                     
-----------   
 (3) I've wrote some simple code to test the differences between the linear chain derivation and multiple-inheritance. class A {...};
class B : A {...};
class C: B {...};
C* pc = new C();
B* pb = NULL;
pb = (B*)pc;
A* pa = NULL;
pa = (A*)pc;
cout << pc << pb << pa
 It shows that pa, pb and pc have the same address. class A {...};
class B {...};
class C: A, B {...};
C* pc = new C();
B* pb = NULL;
pb = (B*)pc;
A* pa = NULL;
pa = (A*)pc;
 Now, pc and pa have the same address, while pb is some offset to pa and pc. Why the compile make these differences? Example 3:(page 377) class A {virtual void f();};
class B {virtual void f(); virtual void g();};
class C: A, B {void f();};
A* pa = new C;
B* pb = new C;
C* pc = new C;
pa->f();
pb->f();
pc->f();
pc->g()
 (1) The first question is about pc->g() which relates to the discussion in example 2. Does the compile do the following transformation: pc->g() ==> g__F1B((*B)((char*)pc+delta(B)))
 Or we have to wait for the runtime to do this? (2) Bjarne wrote: On entry to C::f, the this pointer must point to the beginning of the C object (and not to the B part). However, it is not in general known at compile time that the B pointed to by pb is part of a C so the compiler cannot subtract the constant delta(B). Why we cannot know the B object pointed to by pb is part of a C at the compile time? Based on my understanding, B* pb = new C, pb points to a created C object and C inherits from B, so a B pointer pb points to part of C. (3) Assume that we do not know B pointer to by pb is part of a C at the compile time. So we have to store the delta(B) for the runtime which is actually stored with the vtbl. So the vtbl entry now looks like: struct vtbl_entry {
    void (*fct)();
    int  delta;
}
 Bjarne wrote: pb->f() // call of C::f:
register vtbl_entry* vt = &pb->vtbl[index(f)];
(*vt->fct)((B*)((char*)pb+vt->delta)) //vt->delta is a negative number I guess
 I'm totally confused here. Why (B*) not a (C*) in (*vt->fct)((B*)((char*)pb+vt->delta))???? Based on my understanding and Bjarne's introduction at the first sentence at 5.1 section an 377 page, we should pass a C* as this here!!!!!! Followed by the above code snippet, Bjarne continued writing: Note that the object pointer may have to be adjusted to po int to the correct sub-object before looking for the member pointing to the vtbl. Oh, Man!!! I totally have no idea of what Bjarne tried to say? Can you help me explain it?

@TITLE:Recovering an ECPublicKey from JavaCard to Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement ECDH between a terminal (simulated by my computer) and a smart card (Java Card). I fixed the elliptic curve that I want to use, and on the card side I have the following code to run the first part of the protocol :         ECPublicKey pubKey = (ECPublicKey) KeyBuilder.buildKey(
            KeyBuilder.TYPE_EC_FP_PUBLIC, (short) 0x0100, false);
        pubKey.setFieldFP(p, (short) 0x0001, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setA(a, (short) 0x0001, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setB(b, (short) 0x0000, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setR(r, (short) 0x0001, (short) 0x0020);
        pubKey.setG(g, (short) 0x0000, (short) g.length);

        ECPrivateKey privKey = (ECPrivateKey) KeyBuilder.buildKey(
            KeyBuilder.TYPE_EC_FP_PRIVATE, (short) 0x0100, false);

        KeyPair keypair = new KeyPair(pubKey, privKey);
        keypair.genKeyPair();

        pubKey.getW(apduBuffer, (short) 0x0000);
        setOutgoingAndSend((short) 0x0000, (short) 0x0041);
 So I create a KeyPair for ECDH and I send the public one to my terminal. My problem is the following : I am not able to reconstruct an ECPublicKey given the response APDU I get... I did not find any way to do this in Java (even using external library as Bouncy Castle). Could someone help me ? Thank you in advance.

@LINK:/questions/30732774/modelica-compute-minimum-maximum-of-continuous-variable-over-time
@TITLE:modelica: compute minimum/maximum of continuous variable over time
@CONTENT:As stated above: I wish to compute the minimum (and/or maximum) of a continuous variable over time. Here is a minimal example to demonstrate: model MinMaxTest
  Real u;
  Real u_min(start = 10);
  Real u_max(start = -10);
equation
  u = sin(time / 180 * Modelica.Constants.pi);
  u_min = min(u, u_min);
  u_max = max(u, u_max);
  annotation(experiment(StartTime = 0, StopTime = 360, Tolerance = 1e-06, Interval = 1));
end MinMaxTest;
 u is the arbitrary continuous variable (for demo purposes a simple sinus wave). u_min/u_max is the minimum/maximum over time. Obviously the expected result is u_min=-1 and u_max=1. Unfortunately the simulation crashes with a "Matrix?singular!" error. Can anyone direct me how to avoid that? EDIT 1 I'm using OpenModelica 1.15 (was 1.9.2) EDIT 2 As I'm quite new to Modelica, I'm struggling to understand the differences between the following approaches: u_min = if noEvent(u < u_min) then u else pre(u_min); if noEvent(u < u_min) then u_min = u; else u_min = pre(u_min); end if; u_min = if noEvent(u < u_min) then u else u_min; u_min = if u < u_min then u else pre(u_min); u_min = if u < u_min then u else u_min; when u < u_min then u_min = u; end when; u_min + T*der(u_min) = if u <= u_min then u else u_min; 1 and 2 are equivalent and result in the expected behavior. 3 produces the desired result but gives a "Translation Notification" about an "algebraic loop", why? 4 fails in so far, that the resulting u_min curve is identical to u?! why? 5 combines 3 and 4. 6 fails to compile with Sorry - Support for Discrete Equation Systems is not yet implemented 7 I'm unclear what the idea behind this is, but it works if T is of the suggested size. If I'm understanding the Modelica documentation correctly then 1-5 have in common that exactly one equation is active at all times. noEvent suppresses event generation at the specified zero crossing. I had the impression that this is mostly an efficiency improvement. Why does leaving it out cause 4 to fail? pre refers to the previous value of the variable, so I guess that makes sense if we want to keep a variable constant, but why does 7 work without it? My understanding of when was, that its equation is only active at that precise event, and otherwise keeps the previous value, which is why I tried using it in 6. It seems to work if I compare against constant values (which is of no use for this particular problem). EDIT3 u_min = smooth(0, if u < u_min then u else pre(u_min)); Interestingly, this works also.

@TITLE:Using ng-repeat and filter, how to tell which items are visible?
@CONTENT:I have an array of objects that I'm displaying in my Angular app using ng-repeat. I'm filtering out items using filter and the value of a search input. It works as expected. But, I have a "select all" / "deselect all" option and I only want to select the visibile items in the list (the ones that meet the current search criteria). Without performing the same logic in my controller (i.e. using indexOf the search value on each of my objects), how can I tell which items are currently filtered out by ng-repeat/filter? My view: <input type="text" ng-model="searchValue">
<input type="checkbox" ng-model="checkAll" ng-change="toggleAll()">

<tr ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchValue">
    <td>{{item.id}}</td>
    <td>{{item.name}}</td>
</tr>
 A function in my controller: $scope.toggleAll() {
     for(var i in $scope.items){
         // how can I tell if this item is filtered out in the view?
     }
}
 I have significantly simplified my code samples here for simplicity since this question doesn't need much more detail. Is there a way to do what I'm thinking or do I need to perform the "search" again?

@CONTENT:I have an angular site running on a sails.js backend. I am trying to implement the prerender.io service for my site so that my site can be indexed by search engines. The problem I am running into is that the setup instructions for their node module are specifically for express. Basically they want you to set up this middleware: app.use(require('prerender-node').set('prerenderToken', 'r8c9lN6JsUMMfpzYNlht'));
 Sails doesn't set up middleware this way, but rather through it's policies (for the most part, anyway). This question was raised some time ago here, however it seems it was simply added to a list and never actually addressed. I have also looked at this: How to use custom route middleware with Sails.js?

@CONTENT:I continue to investigate extensible records as in Passing a Shapeless Extensible Record to a Function (continued) : the provided solution works with functions that all takes a parameter that includes at least foo1, foo2 and foo3; that is one can write : fun1(("foo1"->> "hello") :: ("foo2" ->> 1)::("foo3" ->> 1.2)::HNil)
fun1(("foo1"->> "hello") :: ("foo2" ->> 1)::("foo3" ->> 1.2)::("foo4" ->> true::HNil)
 and so on And if we can add a second function fun2 : def fun2[L <: HList : HasMyFields](xs: L) = {
  val selectors = implicitly[HasMyFields[L]]
  import selectors._
  xs("foo1").length + xs("foo2")+ xs("foo3")
}
 So far, so good. Now, let's assume we have a set of fields foo1, foo2,... and a set of functions fun1, fun2,...which take as parameter a record composed with any subset of {foo1, foo2,...}. For example, fun1 could take as parameter a record that contains foo1 and foo3 but not necessarily foo2, fun2 would expects a record with at least foo4 and so on. Is there a way to avoid to declare as many class like HasMyFields as they are possible combinations (if we have n fields, there are 2**n combinations!)?
@CODE:fun1(("foo1"->> "hello") :: ("foo2" ->> 1)::("foo3" ->> 1.2)::HNil)

@TITLE:Solrcloud multicore configuration
@CONTENT:I have a standalone Solr instance with 4 different cores working fine using the embedded Jetty server. I configured the cores for v4.10.3 but since I moved to v5.1 and all seems to work fine without any changes. Before going into production, I need to set it up as a Solrcloud installation, initially with 2 nodes (two different machines) with 1 shard per node (to keep it simple). I have been trying to get it to work but I have not been able to do it. I tried to run it like this (I think using start.jar is not the preferred way), having read that Solr will look for multiple configured cores in any nested folders (which works for standalone Solr): java -DzkRun -DnumShards=2 -Dbootstrap_confdir=solr/ -jar start.jar
 but that did not work, it does not find the needed solrconfig.xml file. My Solr directory looks like this: My solr.xml file is the standard one: <solr>

  <solrcloud>
    <str name="host">${host:}</str>
    <int name="hostPort">${jetty.port:8983}</int>

    class="HttpShardHandlerFactory">
    <int name="socketTimeout">${socketTimeout:0}</int>
    <int name="connTimeout">${connTimeout:0}</int>
  </shardHandlerFactory>

</solr>
 Each core looks like this: And the core.properties just has the name of the core: name=users
 My question is: How do I start Solrcloud v5.1 so the 4 cores are picked up?

@TITLE:HATEOAS paths are invalid when using an API Gateway in a Spring Boot app
@CONTENT:I have two spring boot applications where one of them is acting as an API Gateway (as discussed here Spring Example). The other which is wired into the first one is exposing a profile service using spring-data-rest (spring-data-neo4j-rest). The first application is starting on port 8080 and is using zuul to route requests to the second as follows: zuul:
  routes:
    profiles:
      path: /profiles/**
      url: http://localhost:8083/profiles/  
 This all works fine and requests to http://localhost:8080/profiles are being served from the second app. The problem though is that the HATEOAS links in the response are incorrect. The response from calling that second service are correct: {
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8083/profiles{?page,size,sort}",
            "templated": true
        },
        "search": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8083/profiles/search"
        }
    },
    "_embedded": {
        "profiles": [
            {
                "name": "Andrew Rutter",
                "_links": {
                    "self": {
                        "href": "http://localhost:8083/profiles/0"
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Andrew Rutter",
                "_links": {
                    "self": {
                        "href": "http://localhost:8083/profiles/1"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "page": {
        "size": 20,
        "totalElements": 2,
        "totalPages": 1,
        "number": 0
    }
}
 But when this comes back to my API Gateway, the links are being rewritten to {
  "name": "Andrew Rutter",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/profiles/profiles/0"
    }
  }
}
 Which is the gateway path alias plus the actual service base Uri. Am I missing a zuul option to disable that behavior and just leave the hateoas uri in place with a host adjustment. Or is there a way for my service behind the gateway to be wired to / rather then the default resource endpoint of /profiles (in this case) which would avoid the undesirable path being added in. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a very simple CMake script. Unfortunately, the project uses a *.pde file which is plain C++ or C code. CMake is working with any file ending, but I get a compiler error, because GCC does not know how to handle it. How can I add a global file extension to GCC, so that the *.pde file is compiled as a usual *.cpp file?

@LINK:/questions/30555285/dagger2-injecting-implementation-classes-provided-by-modules-with-component-its
@TITLE:Dagger2: Injecting implementation classes provided by modules with component itself
@CONTENT:Considering modules are all shared among one-another through the Dagger1 specification of complete=false, library=true, you can receive the elements provided by the @Provides methods through a constructor parameter, like so. public class GetUserForUsernameTaskImpl
        implements GetUserForUsernameTask {
    public static final String TAG = GetUserForUsernameTaskImpl.class.getSimpleName();

    private Realm realm;
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public GetUserForUsernameTaskImpl(Realm realm, UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.realm = realm;
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public RealmResults<UserRLM> getUsers() {
        try {
            RealmResults<UserRLM> users = userRepository.findAll(realm);
    ...
}

@Module(includes = {RepositoryModule.class, RealmModule.class})
public class DatabaseTaskModule {
    @Provides
    public GetUsersDatabaseTask getUsersDatabaseTask(Realm realm, UserRepository userRepository) {
        return new GetUsersDatabaseTaskImpl(realm, userRepository);
    }
}
 However, you could also specify only one dependency (the Presenter or the CustomApplication instance) that holds the component graph, and use that component graph to inject your implementation classes. public class GetUserForUsernameTaskImpl
        implements GetUserForUsernameTask {
    public static final String TAG = GetUserForUsernameTaskImpl.class.getSimpleName();

    @Inject
    public Realm realm;
    @Inject
    public UserRepository userRepository;

    protected Presenter presenter;
    private boolean isInjected = false;

    public GetUserForUsernameTaskImpl(Presenter presenter) {
        this.presenter = presenter;
    }

    @Override
    public RealmResults<UserRLM> getUsers() {
        if(!isInjected) {
            presenter.getPresenterComponent().inject(this);
            isInjected = true;
        }
        try {
            RealmResults<UserRLM> users = userRepository.findAll(realm);
            ...
    }
}

@Module(includes = {PresenterModule.class})
public class DatabaseTaskModule {
    @Provides
    public GetUsersDatabaseTask getUsersDatabaseTask(Presenter presenter) {
        return new GetUsersDatabaseTaskImpl(presenter);
    }
}
 And that way, you'd only have to depend on the presenter's object graph, and not have to mess with constructor parameters. Which one is a better approach? EDIT: A clearer and concrete example I have in a not-too-well refactored project is the following: @Module(includes = {ContextModule.class})
public class ClientAuthModule {
    @Provides
    public ClientAuthAuthenticator clientAuthAuthenticator(CustomApplication customApplication) {
        return new ClientAuthAuthenticator(customApplication);
    }
}
 Then public class CustomApplication
        extends Application {
    public static class InjectorInitializedEvent {
    }

    public static class InjectorInitializedEventProducer {
        @Produce
        public InjectorInitializedEvent produceEvent() {
            return new InjectorInitializedEvent();
        }
    }

    private ApplicationComponent applicationComponent;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        applicationComponent = Injector.INSTANCE.initializeApplicationComponent();
        SingletonBus.INSTANCE.getBus().post(new InjectorInitializedEvent());
        SingletonBus.INSTANCE.getBus().register(new InjectorInitializedEventProducer()); //OTTO bus, event producer
    }

    public ApplicationComponent getApplicationComponent() {
        return this.applicationComponent;
    }
}
 Then public class ClientAuthAuthenticator {
    private CustomApplication customApplication;

    @Inject
    public PEMConverter pemConverter;
    @Inject
    public KeyPairCreator keyPairCreator;
    @Inject
    public PKCS10CsrCreator pkcs10CsrCreator;
    @Inject
    public KeyPairReader keyPairReader;
    //...

    public ClientAuthAuthenticator(CustomApplication customApplication) {
        this.customApplication = customApplication;
        SingletonBus.INSTANCE.getBus().register(this);
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void onInjectorInitializedEvent(CustomApplication.InjectorInitializedEvent e) {
        customApplication.getApplicationComponent().inject(this);
        SingletonBus.INSTANCE.getBus().unregister(this);
    }

    ...
 The question: This way, all dependencies are provided from the application's component when the injector is ready, rather than through the constructor. But is this a good approach? Are there any caveats on the long-run? EDIT2: Adding Injector class as per request. public enum Injector {
    INSTANCE;

    private ApplicationComponent applicationComponent;

    ApplicationComponent initializeApplicationComponent() {
        ClientAuthModule clientAuthModule = new ClientAuthModule();
        ServerCommunicationModule serverCommunicationModule = new ServerCommunicationModule();
        CertUtilModule certUtilModule = new CertUtilModule();
        EmmUtilsModule emmUtilsModule = new EmmUtilsModule();
        EncryptUtilsModule encryptUtilsModule = new EncryptUtilsModule();
        OtherUtilsModule otherUtilsModule = new OtherUtilsModule();
        SerializerModule serializerModule = new SerializerModule();
        ContextModule contextModule = new ContextModule();
        LogicModule logicModule = new LogicModule();
        UtilsComponent utilsComponent = DaggerUtilsComponent.builder()
                .emmUtilsModule(emmUtilsModule)
                .encryptUtilsModule(encryptUtilsModule)
                .otherUtilsModule(otherUtilsModule)
                .certUtilModule(certUtilModule)
                .contextModule(contextModule)
                .clientAuthModule(clientAuthModule)
                .serializerModule(serializerModule)
                .build();
        NetworkingComponent networkingComponent = DaggerNetworkingComponent.builder()
                .clientAuthModule(clientAuthModule)
                .contextModule(contextModule)
                .otherUtilsModule(otherUtilsModule)

@TITLE:How to group by projections with Hibernate
@CONTENT:I need to find a list of students that are in a specific group and located in a specific address along with their phone numbers in their location. My main issue is I can not retrieve phone numbers of each student as a collection. For example if I have student1,student2. Phone 1111 for student1 in location1 and phone 2222 and phone 3333 for student2 in location 1 and phone 444 for student2 in location2. Lets say I have Student1 Alex group1 1111 Location1 Street1
Student3 Jack group1 93939 Location2 Street4
Student7 Joe group2 22223 Location4 Street8
Student2 John group1 2222 3333 Location1 Street1
Student2 John group1 4444 Location1 Street2
Student12 Mark group1 4423 Location9 Street9
 Sample Output with data  User asks for all students in group1 and location1 

Student1 Alex Street1 phone 1111 distance30
Student2 John Street1 phones 22222,3333 distance30
Student2 John Street2 phone 4444 distance40
 In other words, I would like to have a list of students along with their locations and phones of the selected location. Hibernate returns following error message against my current code org.springframework.orm.hibernate4.HibernateSystemException:

@LINK:/questions/30553121/add-implicit-conversion-from-unique-ptrt-to-t
@TITLE:Add implicit conversion from unique_ptr<T> to T*
@CONTENT:General Question: Without going into whether or not it's a good idea, how can I add an implicit conversion operator to a class that has already been defined? For example, let's say that I want unique_ptr<T> to implicitly convert to T*, but I can't just add a member conversion operator because I can't change the definition of the unique_ptr class. Options: Is there some c++ voodoo that I can use to make this happen without creating a member function? Answer-So-Far: NO. There is no way to add an implicit conversion away from a type that you can't modify in code. Just ... sadness. Could I derive from std::unique_ptr and add my own member conversion function? Are there any serious downsides to this? Answer-So-Far: Yes (from vsoftco) Downsides are yet to be determined. So far inheriting from std::unique_ptr, inheriting its constructors, and declaring an implicit conversion operator has worked splendidly with hardly any code needing to be written. Am I just going to have to live without this the rest of my life? Answer-So-Far: We'll see... If I can get option 2 up and running without any serious side-effect or burdens, I'll test it out for a while and report back on whether I think it's worth it. We'll see! Example code: #include <algorithm>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

struct MyClass
{
    MyClass(int v) : value(v) {}

    int value;
};

int main()
{
    auto vec = std::vector<std::unique_ptr<MyClass>>();

    vec.push_back(std::make_unique<MyClass>(1));
    vec.push_back(std::make_unique<MyClass>(2));

    // error C2664: 'void (__vectorcall *)(MyClass *)' : cannot convert argument 1 from 'std::unique_ptr<MyClass,std::default_delete<_Ty>>' to 'MyClass *'
    std::for_each(std::begin(vec), std::end(vec), [](MyClass* myClass)
    {
        myClass->value += 3;

@TITLE:Why should I use Runnable instead of Thread? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: ¡§implements Runnable¡¨ vs. ¡§extends Thread¡¨ 32 answers I just learn the theory about thread. And there is Thread and Runnable. class A extends Thread{

 class B implements Runnable{

@TITLE:When to use range.value?
@CONTENT:This ought to be simple, but I cant' find a clear answer. If I'm reading/writing to a range, when do I just use the range name and when do Ineed to use range.value? Does it matter if the range is one cell or multiple cells? Does it matter what the type of the variable is? Or the type of the data in the range? Is there a best practice for this? For example, should I write `a = Range("Test")`
 or should I write `a = Range("Test").value`
 Similarly, `Range("Test") = a`
 or `Range("Test").value = a`
@CODE:`a = Range("Test")` `a = Range("Test").value` `Range("Test") = a` `Range("Test").value = a`

@TITLE:std::sort doing lots of unnecessary swaps
@CONTENT:I have the following code where I try a lexicographical comparison of two simple vectors class ExpensiveClass {
public:
  static int increment;
  std::vector<int> bigVector;

  ExpensiveClass() {
    for (int j = 0; j < 1 + increment; ++j)
      bigVector.emplace_back(j);
    ++increment;
  }
  ExpensiveClass(const ExpensiveClass& other) {
    std::cout << "Expensive copy constructor called!" << std::endl;
    this->bigVector = other.bigVector;
  }
};

int ExpensiveClass::increment = 0;

bool sortFunc(const ExpensiveClass& a, const ExpensiveClass& b) {
  bool ret = a.bigVector < b.bigVector;
  if (ret == false)
    std::cout << "Need to swap" << std::endl;
  return ret;
}

int main()
{
  std::vector<ExpensiveClass> vectorOfVectors;
  vectorOfVectors.reserve(100);
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
    vectorOfVectors.emplace_back();

  std::cout << "Start sorting.." << std::endl;
  std::sort(vectorOfVectors.begin(), vectorOfVectors.end(), sortFunc);
}
 and I'd like to know why is std::sort doing lots of swaps even on a sorted vector?

 It works fine until recently in new browser like Firefox Aurora and Chrome Canary, it rejects with (in Firefox's case): An error occurred during a connection to localhost:8443. SSL received a weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key in Server Key Exchange handshake message. (Error code: ssl_error_weak_server_ephemeral_dh_key) There is no way to accept it manually. So, I should re-generate a stronger key? Or it's a configuration in jetty?

@LINK:/questions/30517546/how-does-extern-work-in-namespaces
@TITLE:How does extern work in namespaces?
@CONTENT:I'm running a simple program similar to what I found here. It's meant to reduce code bloat when including constants in multiple files. It does this by using const global variables within a namespace with their respective extern forward declarations. globals.h #ifndef GLOBALS_H_
#define GLOBALS_H_

namespace Constants
{
    // forward declarations only
    extern const double pi;
    extern const double avogadro;
    extern const double my_gravity;
}

#endif
 globals.cpp namespace Constants
{
    // actual global variables
    extern const double pi(3.14159);
    extern const double avogadro(6.0221413e23);
    extern const double my_gravity(9.2); // m/s^2 -- gravity is light on this planet
}
 source.cpp #include <iostream>
#include <limits>

#include "globals.h"

int main()
{
    double value_of_pi = Constants::pi;

    std::cout << value_of_pi;

    std::cin.clear();
    std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
    std::cin.get();

    return 0;
}
 I assume that Constants::pi gets the value pi contained in the globals.cpp Constants namespace, and is able to do so because it has access to the namespace itself from the included globals.h. What I don't understand is why the const global definitions/initializations in globals.cpp need the extern keyword? I tried removing the extern keywords in globals.cpp thinking that it wasn't needed, but my program won't run without them. I thought extern was only used for forward declarations? Why are they needed for the const global definitions/initializations? Has it something to do with the namespace they are defined in?
@CODE:extern #ifndef GLOBALS_H_
#define GLOBALS_H_

namespace Constants
{
    // forward declarations only
    extern const double pi;
    extern const double avogadro;
    extern const double my_gravity;
}

#endif namespace Constants
{
    // actual global variables
    extern const double pi(3.14159);
    extern const double avogadro(6.0221413e23);
    extern const double my_gravity(9.2); // m/s^2 -- gravity is light on this planet
} #include <iostream>
#include <limits>

#include "globals.h"

int main()
{
    double value_of_pi = Constants::pi;

    std::cout << value_of_pi;

    std::cin.clear();
    std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
    std::cin.get();

    return 0;

@LINK:/questions/30511823/predictable-exit-code-of-crashed-process-in-windows
@TITLE:Predictable exit code of crashed process in Windows
@CONTENT:For a process exiting normally in Windows, the exit code of the process is generally either the return value from main, or the exit code passed to std::exit. %ERRORLEVEL% can then be used to query the exit code, and that can be used to determine whether the program executed either correctly, or there were some exceptional inputs/failures that indicate a particular problem (application specific). However, I'm interested in the exit code if the process crashes. Take a very simple example program: int main()
{
    int * a = nullptr;
    *a = 0xBAD;
    return 0;
}
 When I compile this and run in Windows, on the command line I get: MyCrashProgram.exe -> crashes
echo %ERRORLEVEL%  -> -1073741819
 The exit code is consistently this number. Which leads me to several questions: Was the exit code -1073741819 somehow predicable, based on the invalid write crash? If so, is there some way to determine the type of crash, based on the exit code? Does this change with the compiler used (I used MSVC 2012)? Does this change with the version of Windows being used (I used Win10 TP)? Does this change with the architecture (eg. x64 - I used Win32)? Note, I am not interested in how to modify the program to catch the exception. I am interested in classifying crashes that can happen in existing programs, that I may not be able to modify.
@CODE:main std::exit %ERRORLEVEL% int main()
{
    int * a = nullptr;
    *a = 0xBAD;
    return 0;
} MyCrashProgram.exe -> crashes

@CONTENT:I am using laravel in a project. On my local machine the server I have to access is just laraveltest.dev. When I open this URL the project works fine and without problems. However, when I upload this on a testing server, where the stuff is located in a sub-foder, like this: laraveltest.de/test2/. The public folder is at laraveltest.de/test2/public/, but when calling laraveltest.de/test2/public the application always returns an 404 error. I thought this might be because of the base path, so I did the following in the bootstrap/app.php $app = new Laravel\Lumen\Application(
    realpath(__DIR__.'/../') . env('APP_BASE_PATH')
);
 where env('APP_BASE_PATH') is the subfolder. So app->basePath() returns /var/www/laraveltest/test2/public. However, when now opening laraveltest.de/test2/public I'm always getting the 404 error and I don't know why. What am I doing wrong?

@TITLE:Angular.JS API using a factory
@CONTENT:I've written a backend service which is used by a Angular.JS frontend using a factory, like so: angular.module('app.social', ['ngResource'])
    .factory('Social', function($http) {
        return {
            me: function() {
                return $http.get('http://localhost:3000/me');
            },
            likeVideo: function(link) {
                return $http.post('http://localhost:3000/like/video', { link : link });
            },
            post: function(link) {
                return $http.post('http://localhost:3000/post', { link : link });
            },
            postVideo: function(link) {
                return $http.post('http://localhost:3000/post/video', { link : link });
            },
            friends: function() {
                return $http.get('http://localhost:3000/friends');
            },
            taggableFriends: function() {
                return $http.get('http://localhost:3000/friends/taggable');
            },
            videos: function() {
                return $http.get('http://localhost:3000/videos');
            }
        };
    });
 The Social.me endpoint receives profile information from the REST backend. This function is used in various Angular controllers, however (profile page, item detail page, header account button etc.). This means that for every view, profile information is requested from http://localhost:3000/me. Is this good practice, or is it a better idea to cache the information within the factory? EDIT: Updated code (based on answer from @Rebornix): angular.module('app.social', ['ngResource'])
    .service('SocialService', function() {
        var serviceData = {
            me: null
        };
        return serviceData;
    })
    .factory('Social', function($http, SocialService) {
        return {
            me: function() {
                if (SocialService.me === null) {
                    return $http.get('http://localhost:3000/me').then(function(response) {
                        SocialService.me = response.data;
                        return SocialService.me;
                    });
                } else {
                    return SocialService.me;
                }
            }
        }
    };
});
 In the controller, I use: angular.module('app.profile', [])
    .controller('ProfileCtrl', ['$window', '$scope', 'Social', function($window, $scope, Social) {
        $scope.me = Social.me();
    }])
 And the view: <div ng-controller="ProfileCtrl">
    <h1 class="profile-name">{{ me.name }}</h1>
</div>
 But the view is not updated as the Facebook.me value get initialized on the first request. I guess I have to manually trigger $scope.$apply() somehow?
@CODE:angular.module('app.social', ['ngResource'])
    .factory('Social', function($http) {
        return {
            me: function() {
                return $http.get('http://localhost:3000/me');
            },
            likeVideo: function(link) {
                return $http.post('http://localhost:3000/like/video', { link : link });
            },

                return $http.post('http://localhost:3000/post', { link : link });
            },
            postVideo: function(link) {
                return $http.post('http://localhost:3000/post/video', { link : link });
            },

@CONTENT:I'm having a problem with React Native and Parse JS SDK. I'm using https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseReact I have built a login, sign up and a main view, Sign up and log in works well but after i logged in -> directed to main view and when I refresh the app (CMD+R) in my simulator, it brings me back to the login view again, i should be brought to Main view. As you can see I have set a state for initialComponent: this.state = {

@LINK:/questions/30488022/how-to-use-expression-tree-to-safely-access-path-of-nullable-objects
@TITLE:How to use Expression Tree to safely access path of nullable objects?
@CONTENT:When I get deserialized XML result into xsd-generated tree of objects and want to use some deep object inside that tree a.b.c.d.e.f, it will give me exception if any node on that query path is missing. if(a.b.c.d.e.f != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 I want to avoid checking for null for each level like this: if(a != null)
if(a.b != null)
if(a.b.c != null)
if(a.b.c.d != null)
if(a.b.c.d.e != null)
if(a.b.c.d.e.f != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 First solution is to implement Get extension method that allows this: if(a.Get(o=>o.b).Get(o=>o.c).Get(o=>o.d).Get(o=>o.e).Get(o=>o.f) != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 Second solution is to implement Get(string) extension method and use reflection to get result looking like this: if(a.Get("b.c.d.e.f") != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 Third solution, could be to implement ExpandoObject and use dynamic type to get result looking like this: dynamic da = new SafeExpando(a);
if(da.b.c.d.e.f != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 But last 2 solutions do not give benefits of strong typing and IntelliSense. I think the best could be fourth solution that can be implemented with Expression Trees: if(Get(a.b.c.d.e.f) != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 or if(a.Get(a=>a.b.c.d.e.f) != null)
    Console.Write("ok");
 I already implemented 1st and 2nd solutions. Here is how 1st solution looks like: [DebuggerStepThrough]
public static To Get<From,To>(this From @this, Func<From,To> get)
{
    var ret = default(To);
    if(@this != null && !@this.Equals(default(From)))
        ret = get(@this);

    if(ret == null && typeof(To).IsArray)
        ret = (To)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(To), 0);

    return ret;
}
 How to implement 4th solution if possible ? Also it would be interesting to see how to implement 3rd solution if possible.
@CODE:if(a.b.c.d.e.f != null)
    Console.Write("ok"); if(a != null)
if(a.b != null)
if(a.b.c != null)
if(a.b.c.d != null)
if(a.b.c.d.e != null)
if(a.b.c.d.e.f != null)
    Console.Write("ok"); if(a.Get(o=>o.b).Get(o=>o.c).Get(o=>o.d).Get(o=>o.e).Get(o=>o.f) != null)
    Console.Write("ok"); if(a.Get("b.c.d.e.f") != null)
    Console.Write("ok"); dynamic da = new SafeExpando(a);

        ret = get(@this);

    if(ret == null && typeof(To).IsArray)
        ret = (To)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(To), 0);

    return ret;

@LINK:/questions/30485295/measure-i-o-demands-for-method-invocations
@TITLE:Measure I/O demands for method invocations
@CONTENT:I am interested in performance measurements (CPU and disk I/O demands) of Java EE applications. For CPU I already figured out how to measure the CPU demand of each method invocation. By invoking java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadCpuTime() at the beginning and at the end of each method (e.g. using an EJB interceptor) I can get the ("pure") time which the CPU needed for processing this method (CPU Demand). Unfortunately, the I/O demand (disk: read and write time for each method invocation) seems to be really hard to measure. The ThreadMXBean does not provide such data. Just substracting the above measured CPU demand from the complete response time of each method is not sufficient due to Suspension and Sync time (also it would be nice to distinguish between read and write if possible). I was thinking about digging further down to the Operating System interfaces to try to invoke Syscalls or parse other kernel information. Currently I am trying to understand how tools like "sar" measure the "iowait" time and how I could map such data to my Java threads and respective methods. But I am not sure if I am heading in the right direction as my deeper OS knowledge is limited. Long story short: How can I measure I/O Demand (disk read and write times) for each of my method invocations? Thanks in advance, bkk

@LINK:/questions/30461839/sending-a-delete-request-from-a-form-in-django
@TITLE:Sending a DELETE request from a form in Django
@CONTENT:I am trying to send a DELETE request from a form in Django taking help from jQuery referring following link below; https://baxeico.wordpress.com/2014/06/25/put-and-delete-http-requests-with-django-and-jquery/ What I have are the following scripts; <script src="jquery-1.11.3.js"></script>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function(){
    $.ajax({
      id : 'delete',
      headers : {'X_METHODOVERRIDE': 'DELETE'}
    });
  });
</script>
 (I intend to have) acting on the following form; <form method="post" id="delete" name="delete" action="">
  {% csrf_token %}
  <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
</form>
 And the following middleware; from django.http import QueryDict

class HttpPostTunnelingMiddleware(object):
    def process_request(self, request):
        if request.META.has_key('HTTP_X_METHODOVERRIDE'):
            http_method = request.META['HTTP_X_METHODOVERRIDE']
            if http_method.lower() == 'put':
                request.method  = 'PUT'
                request.META['REQUEST_METHOD'] = 'PUT'
                request.PUT = QueryDict(request.body)
            if http_method.lower() == 'delete':
                request.method  = 'DELETE'
                request.META['REQUEST_METHOD'] = 'DELETE'
                request.DELETE = QueryDict(request.body)
        return None        
 I have it added to the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES list in my settings.py; MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'stationrunner.middleware.HttpPostTunnelingMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
)
 It's the 3rd entry, before the CsrfViewMiddleware taking words of @Daniel Roseman into consideration. And finally in my class based view I have the delete method delete the corresponding object; class StationHome(View):
    .
    .
    .
    def post(self,request, pk):
        station = Station.objects.get(pk=pk)
        form = StationForm(request.POST, instance=station)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("home_station",
                                                kwargs={'pk':pk},
                                            )
                                    )
        else:
            return HttpResponse("Form Invalid!")

    def delete(self, request, pk):
        Station.objects.get(pk=pk).delete()
        return HttpResponseRedirect(
            reverse("list_create_station")                      
            )
    .
    .
 I expect the middleware and the script make a DELETE request sent to the view but things ain't flying. A POST method itself is being sent. Django is finding an invalid form and gives me the response; "Form Invalid!" (else: return HttpResponse("Form Invalid!") Please bare with me if you find stupid things here. I am new to Django and have made acquaintance with jQuery only today. Update I have updated the script to look like; <script>
  $(document).ready(function(){
    $('#delete').submit.function(e){
      e.preventDefault();
      var station_id = {{ station.id }}
      $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: '/station/' + station_id,
        headers: {'X_METHODOVERRIDE': 'DELETE'}
      });
    });
  });

 I have the object passed to the template as station and I have used the Django template language inside the script (var station_id = {{ station.id }}) taking inspiration from http://stackoverflow.com/a/6008968/4672736 The result is the same :/ Update Debugging js found that the browser wasn't finding the jQuery file. Now with static files properly configured and also, the csrf protection set with help of jquery.cookie.js I have the below code in my template; <script src="{% static "stationrunner/jquery-1.11.3.js" %}"></script>
<script src="{% static "stationrunner/jquery.cookie.js" %}"></script>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function(){
    var csrftoken = $.cookie('csrftoken');
    function csrfSafeMethod(method) {
      // these HTTP methods don't require CSRF protection
      return(/^(GET|HEAD|OPTIONS|TRACE)$/.test(method));
    }
    $.ajaxSetup({
      beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) {
        if(!csrfSafeMethod(settings.type) && !this.crossDomain) {
          xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken", csrftoken);
        }
      }
    });
    $('#delete').submit(function(e){
      e.preventDefault();
      $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: '{% url 'home_station' station.id %}',
        headers: {'X_METHODOVERRIDE': 'DELETE'}
      });
    });
  });
</script>
 Now I have no errors on the front end but success ain't met yet. The submission of the form gets me a 200 response instead of 302. Is this expected with an AJAX request? It seems the request is not yet getting passed to the view as a delete request. I tried adding success: function(){alert('Object deleted!')} to $.ajax and the alert do pop up. Update The final hurdle was that I had to use dashes in the custom header passed instead of underscores. I changed headers: { 'X_METHODOVERRIDE': 'DELETE' } to headers: { 'X-METHODOVERRIDE': 'DELETE' }. The letters need not be passed in capital letters too. Django will anyway convert them to capitals. So x-methodoverride or x-MeThODoveRrIDE for that matter is fine too. I don't know why dashes instead of underscores though. I figured that out as the other headers passed were carrying dashes and not underscores. Earlier the middleware wasn't finding the key HTTP_X_METHODOVERRIDE. Now it does and my view gets a delete request :). Thanks to @baxeico for all the help.

@TITLE:Counting elements of a Stream
@CONTENT:I want to count the different elements of a stream and am wondering why Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("a", "b", "a", "c", "c", "a", "a", "d");
Map<String, Integer> counter1 = stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(s -> s, 1, Integer::sum));
 doesn't work. Eclipse tells me The method toMap(Function, Function, BinaryOperator) in the type Collectors is not applicable for the arguments (( s) -> {}, int, Integer::sum) By the way, I know about that solution: Map<String, Long> counter2 = stream.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(s -> s, Collectors.counting()));
 So I have two questions: What is the mistake in my first approach? How would you implement such a counter? EDIT: I solved the first question by myself: Map<String, Integer> counter1 = stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(s -> s, s -> 1, Integer::sum)); 
 Java is expecting a function as second argument.
@CODE:Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("a", "b", "a", "c", "c", "a", "a", "d");
Map<String, Integer> counter1 = stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(s -> s, 1, Integer::sum)); Map<String, Long> counter2 = stream.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(s -> s, Collectors.counting())); Map<String, Integer> counter1 = stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(s -> s, s -> 1, Integer::sum)); Map<String, Integer> .collect(groupingBy(s -> s, summingInt(s -> 1))); counting()

@TITLE:C++: call pure virtual function from member function of same class
@CONTENT:I know there are already these type of questions asked on SO, but my question is different. so please read my question entirely before marking it as duplicate. Consider following 2 programs. #include <iostream>
using std::cout;
class Base {
    public:
        virtual void f()=0;
        void g() {
            f();
        }
        virtual ~Base() { }
};
class Derived : public Base
{
    public:
    void f() {
        cout<<"Derived::f() is called\n";
    }
     ~Derived() {}
};
class Derived1 : public Base
{
    public:
    void f() {
        cout<<"Derived1::f() is called\n";
    }
    ~Derived1() { }
};
int main() {
    Derived1 d;
    Base& b=d;
    b.g();
    b.f();
}
 Compiles & runs fine and gives expected outcome.. #include <iostream>
using std::cout;
class Base {
    public:
        virtual void f()=0;
        Base() {
            f();    // oops,error can't call from ctor & dtor
        }
};
class Derived : public Base
{
    public:
        void f() {
            std::cout<<"Derived::f() is called\n";
        }
};
int main() { Derived d; Base& b=d; b.f(); }
 The above program fails in compilation. Why it is allowed to call pure virtual function from the member function of same class in which pure virtual function is declared? Is it fine to do this or is it undefined behavior because derived class still not provide implementation of pure virtual function? Why pure virtual function can't be called from constructor & destructor of the same class? I know that Derived class constructors can call pure virtual function of the base class. What the C++ standard says about this? Thanks

 My Problems that not solved are The app is not working when I add an onItemclicklistener to the list view. bluetooth search result is filling with the same device name. I cannot access the buttons after viewing pairing devices and scanned devices(it seems like that the same layout is popping to screen). Anyone please help me to solve these issues. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Difficulty in understanding complex multi threading in Android app
@CONTENT:I have big problem with understanding multi threading in my application and because of that finding a bug. I've checked I think all possibilities and still I am getting various (sometimes unexpected) errors. Maybe someone here will be able to advice me, what I should do. In my project I am using two external libraries: GraphView - provides views for graph drawing EventBus - provides interface for easy communication between app components As for the app it has the structure like this:            MainActivity
            /        \
           /          \
        Thread        Fragment
   (ProcessThread)   (GraphFragment)
 The idea is that ProcessThread computes data and provides constant stream of values to GraphFragment throught EventBus. In GraphFragment I have one Series required by GraphView. To update graphs in real time according to the example I need to make a new Runnable so I did one: private class PlotsRun implements Runnable{

        @Override
        public void run() {
            mSeries1.appendData(new DataPoint(counter, getRandom()), true, 100);
            counter++;
            mHandler.post(this);
        }
}
 and when I start it from fragment's onResume() method everything is working like a charm. Unfortunately as I've mentioned I am using external data from another thread. To get it inGraphFragment I am using (according to the documentation) onEventMainThread() method. And in here no matter what I'll do I can't pass data to update my graph in PlotsRun object. So far I've tried: using Queue - add value in onEventMainThread and get in PlotsRun. It turned out that runnable is reading faster than method is able to update queue. creating various buffers - the result is quite this same as with Queue. calling mSeries1.appendData(new DataPoint(counter, getRandom()), true, 100); directly from onEventMainThread - at some point it gets freez. creating onEvent() method inside my runnable and call from there mHandler.post() - it is blocking UI and updates looks like snapshots. using everything mentioned with or without synchronized() block. What is quite difficult for me to understand is this runnable which is working correctly (at some point). As it is said on official Android blog you can't update UI from non UI thread. This is why I can't use another thread inside GraphFragment. But when I've checked my runnable it is running on main thread (UI). This is why I can't create infinite while loop there instead have to call mHandler.post(this). And still it behaves like another thread because it is faster (called more frequently) then onEventMainThread method. What can I do to be able to update my graphs (or where I should look) using data from ProcessThread? EDIT1: Answering on @Matt Wolfe request I am including what I think is the most important part of a code for this problem with all required variable shown how they are declared. It is very simplified example: MainActivity: private ProcessThread testThread = new ProcessThread();

 @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        testThread.start();
    }


    private class ProcessThread extends Thread{
        private float value = 0f;
        private ReadingsUpdateData updater = new ReadingsUpdateData(values);
        public void run() {
            while(true) {
                value = getRandom();
                updater.setData(value);
                EventBus.getDefault().post(updater);
            }
        }
    }
 GraphFragment: private LineGraphSeries<DataPoint> mSeries1;
    long counter = 0;
    private Queue<ReadingsUpdateData> queue;

    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        mTimer2.run();
    }

    public void onEventMainThread(ReadingsUpdateData data){
        synchronized(queue){
            queue.add(data);
        }
    }

    private class PlotsRun implements Runnable{

        @Override
        public void run() {
            if (queue.size()>0) {
                mSeries1.appendData(new DataPoint(counter, queue.poll()), true, 100);
                counter++;
            }
            mHandler.post(this);
        }
    }
 The if in runnable is added for protection because of this to fast reading problem. But it shouldn't be here because there should always be something (at least I expect that). One more thing to add - when I put simple Log.d and counting variable inside onEventMainThread it was updating and displaying it's value correctly, but unfortunately logcat isn't main UI. EDIT2: This is mainly response for @MattWolfe comment The mHandler is just variable declared and created in GrapgFragment: private final Handler mHandler = new Handler();
private Runnable mTimer2;
 Yes, that is right I am using mHandler.post() without any delay. I'll try using some delay to see if there is any difference. What I didn't mention earlier is that the ProcessThread is providing also data to other fragments - don't worry they don't interfere with each other or share any resources. This is why I am using EventBus. EDIT3: This a code that I've used as my another idea with another thread in GraphFragment and runOnMainThread method: private MyThread thread = new MyThread();

    private class MyThread extends Thread {
        Queue<ReadingsUpdateData> inputList;
        ReadingsUpdateData msg;

        public MyThread() {
            inputList = new LinkedList<>();
        }

        public void run() {
            while(true) {
                try{
                    msg = inputList.poll();
                } catch(NoSuchElementException nse){
                    continue;
                }
                if (msg == null) {
                    continue;
                }
                getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        mSeries1.appendData(new DataPoint(counter, getRandom()), true, 100);
                        counter++;
                    }
                });
            }
        }

        public void onEvent(ReadingsUpdateData data){
            inputList.add(data);
        }
    }
 Unfortunately, it isn't working neither.

@TITLE:Guice : Set bindings from an XML file
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Guice and make all the bindings with the help of an XML file. In my module (let's say "CustomModule"), I would like to load an XML file and parse it to set all the bindings. I'm able to load the XML file and retrieve all the values needed (below is an exemple of my XML file), but I'm unable to use those values to bind(interfaceValue).to(implementationValue);. What I've tried so far: Load the XML file, retrieve all the values and use them as : bind(Class.fromName(Ivalue)).to(Class.fromName(Value)); where Ivalue is InterfaceFoo and Value is Foo. Load the XML file as a Properties file and use Names.bindProperties(binder(), properties);. Bind manually, which is not what I want. Results: Doesn't work, because Guice cannot verify if the implementation is an implementation of the interface. Gives an error No implementation for interface was bound. Works, but it is not wanted since I have to edit my CustomModule to change the bindings (in the case if I want Bar to be the implementation of InterfaceFoo). I've looked at this, but with not so much success since there is not very much documentation on it. I also looked for a solution here on SO, but most of the time the questions are about properties or the use of annotation. Is there a simple way to specify the Interfaces / Implementations in a file and give it to Guice as a "configuration"? My XML file: <bindings>
  <binding>
    <interface>interfaces.IReaderService</interface>
    <implementation>implementation.MemsReaderService</implementation>
  </binding>
  <binding>

 So, the non-dplyr, "dumb" way to do it would be count <- 0
for (i in 1930:1931){
  count <- count + 1
  temp <- filter(fertility, Year == i)
  mod <- mgcv::gam(fertility ~ s(AGE), data=temp)
  pred[length(15:44) * (count - 1) + 1:30] <- predict(mod, newdata = data.frame(AGE = 15:44))
}

fertility1 <- mutate(fertility, pred = pred)
 But I'd like a method in dplyr. My thought was to use do to create a model for each column, then use predict to obtain the values. The first step I can do, but I'm struggling to implement the second part in dplyr: library(mgcv)
library(dplyr)

  fertility %>%
    #filter(!is.na(fertility)) %>%  # not sure if this is necessary
    group_by(Year) %>%
    dplyr::do(model = mgcv::gam(fertility ~ s(AGE), data = .)) %>%
    left_join(fertility, .) %>%
    mutate(smoothed = predict(model, newdata = AGE))
 I get the error message Error in UseMethod("predict") : 
  no applicable method for 'predict' applied to an object of class "list"
 which presumably means dplyr doesn't remember that model is a model, rather than just a list element.

@TITLE:Warning: Attempt to present <UIAlertController: 0x7facd3946920> on <¡K> which is already presenting (null)
@CONTENT:I have a long press gesture set on a UITableView that presents a UIAlertController containing the cell's text. When the UIAlertController is presented I get this warning: Attempt to present <UIAlertController: 0x7fd57384e8e0>  on <TaskAppV2.MainTaskView: 0x7fd571701150> which is already presenting (null)
 From my understanding, MainTaskView (the UITableView) is already presenting a view, so it shouldn't present a second view, the UIAlertController. So I tried this solution from a similar question. It does not work as I get the same warning. What can I do to solve this warning? See below for code: func longPressedView(gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer){

    /*Get cell info from where user tapped*/
    if (gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerState.Ended) {
        var tapLocation: CGPoint = gestureRecognizer.locationInView(self.tableView)

        var tappedIndexPath: NSIndexPath? = self.tableView.indexPathForRowAtPoint(tapLocation)
        if (tappedIndexPath != nil) {
            var tappedCell: UITableViewCell? = self.tableView.cellForRowAtIndexPath(tappedIndexPath!)
            println("the cell task name is \(tappedCell!.textLabel!.text!)")
        } else {
            println("You didn't tap on a cell")
        }
    }

    /*Long press alert*/
    let tapAlert = UIAlertController(title: "Long Pressed", message: "You just long pressed the long press view", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert)
    tapAlert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .Destructive, handler: nil))
    /*
    if (self.presentedViewController == nil) {
        self.presentViewController(tapAlert, animated: true, completion: nil)
    } else {
        println("already presenting a view")
    } */

    self.presentViewController(tapAlert, animated: true, completion: nil)
    println("presented")
}
 Console output: presented
You didn't tap on a cell

presented
 For some reason, both pieces of code are executing in the if statement when the long press gesture happens. The alert is presented and the text is printed to the console. Is this an issue? Edit: As Matt said, I didn't have all my code in the scope of the gesture recognizer test. Moving that in fixed my problem. The code outside of the test was being executed twice, resulting in the UIAlertController being presented twice.

 Faces length is constantly 0. Looks like it doesn't recognise a face properly or I missed something. I know approach with FaceDetector. I just wanted to check how it works with new camera2 Face.

@CONTENT:Having some trouble with this with taking a weird output and turning it into readable screenplay format. So here is the HTML. <div>

<p class="actor">Steve</p>
<p class="line">Yeah.</p>
</div>
 My attempts have solving this have failed. but the basic idea is this... loop through each instance of p.actor store first instance as a var check next instance against var if they are the same append contents of that instance's p.line into the p.line of var else replace var with new p.actor Also, if encounter a p.dirNote next instance of p.actor sets new var basically when finished the html should look like this <div>
<p class="actor">John</p>
<p class="line">I want to buy milk. Milk is expensive.</p>
<p class="dirNote">John grabs the milk</p>
<p class="actor">John</p>

@TITLE:Find a math algorithm for an equation
@CONTENT:I just post a mathematic question at math.stackexchange, but I'll ask people here for a programmatically recursive algorithm. The problem: fill in the blank number from 1 to 9 (once and only once each blank) to finish the equation. Additional conditions: 1. Mathematic priority DOES matter. 
2. All numbers (include evaluation result) should be integers.
Which mean the divide should be divisible (E.g. 9 mod 3 = 0 is OK, 8 mod 3 != 0 is not OK).
3. For those who don't know (as one in the original question), the operations in the diagram are: 
+ = plus; : = divide; X = multiple; - = minus.
 There should be more than 1 answer. I'd like to have a recursive algorithm to find out all the solutions. Original question PS: I'd like to learn about the recursive algorithm, performance improval. I was trying to solve the problem using brute force. My PC freeze for quite a while.

 This used to work fine before I moved my database class to a singleton model. Any suggestions how this should be handled with Robolectric? I couldn't find any documentation or samples on this. EDIT: Running Robolectric 3.0 RC-2 Robolectric is driving my activity which attempts to do some work with the database. In my app DB class, removing the check for instance == null from below 'fixes' the issue (i.e. there's no issue with Robolectric running the test if MySQLiteOpenHelper is recreated every time) public static synchronized MyDataManager getInstance(Context context){
    if (sInstance == null) {
        sInstance = new MyDataManager(context.getApplicationContext());
    }
    return sInstance;
}

private MyDataManager(Context context) {
    dbHelper = new MySQLiteOpenHelper(context);
}
 MySQLiteOpenHelper is a simple extension of SQLiteOpenHelper. The failure is happening on (again, this is inside by db class):         database = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
 Obviously I don't really want to recreate a connection every time in my App - and I think nobody would want that? Which makes me think there should be a way to do this properly in Robolectric and I'm just missing a trick here? EDIT: Also, the test runs successfully in isolation, which makes me think it's something to do with Robolectric moving between the test cases and reusing the database connection? Both tests don't do ANYTHING specific to database or related to any of the DB classes. First test starts a fragment which will access the database to write some data. Second test is failing on attempt to open the db as above.

           on-core-response="{{responseHandler}}">
</core-ajax>
 Now I tried the same thing with iron-ajax. But it sends literally "{{username}}" and "{{password}}" instead of their values. Here is the code: <iron-ajax
           id="ajax"
           method="POST" 
           contentType="application/json"
           url="{{url}}"   
           body='{"username":"{{username}}", "password":"{{password}}"}'
           handle-as="json"
           on-response="responseHandler">
</iron-ajax>
 How to make it work? Thank you for your answers :)

@LINK:/questions/30277242/why-is-my-app-asking-for-phone-id-permission
@TITLE:Why is my app asking for phone id permission?
@CONTENT:In my manifest I only ask for these two permissions: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
 But when I install the app on my phone I also get this notice: Low-risk permissions
Phone ID
Get your phone ID, including IMEI, IMSI, etc.
 From what I gather from this SO answer, I should need to use TelephonyManager and call <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
 to require this permission. But I'm not using TelephonyManager or calling that permission. I don't want to ask users to give this permission. I've looked through my manifest and gradle files. Could it be that some code I used triggered this permission being called without me specifically asking for it? I know I'm not giving you a lot to go on, by I don't know where else to look. Update 1 I created a completely new project in Android Studio and generated a signed APK from it. I installed it but no permissions were asked. (That at least confirmed for me that it wasn't some "new feature" in Android Studio that automatically asked for this permission.) Update 2 As of @antonio's answer I found app/build/outputs/logs/manifest-merger-release-report.txt However, I didn't find any implied permissions being requested. Update 3 Here are the dependencies my app is using (from gradle.build): dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.3'
    compile 'com.readystatesoftware.sqliteasset:sqliteassethelper:+'
}
 I tested a new application with both of these dependencies and no permissions were requested. My next step is to add every activity again from scratch and see if I can find where this permission starts getting called. To be continued... Update 4 I played around with copying everything to a new project and refactoring the project name and removing pieces, but it turned out to be quite complex. I wasn't able to isolate a reason. Update 5 I set the targetSdkVersion to 1. This gives a new message when announcing permissions before installing the app: read phone status and identity Allows the app to access the phone features of the device. This permission allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether the call is active, and the remote number connected by a call. The old Phone ID permission notice that I wrote about at the beginning is still there (showing up after the app is installed). This makes me wonder if it is related to the OS (I'm using MIUI Android on a Xiaomi phone). There is still something about the app that causes this to display in this app but not in other apps. I need to test this out on other devices next.

@CONTENT:I have a package of code that's been written by someone else. I am running a script, which calls some functions, which in turn calls some more functions, etc. I would like to get the list of functions that are not MATLAB built-in functions but are a part of the package. I tried using matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts('file.m'), which gives me a list of such functions, but not all the functions. I can see when I look at the code that there are many more functions called by a function in the script. Does this command only show 'first-level' functions? How can I get the full list?

@TITLE:Why does Jackson 2 not recognize the first capital letter if the leading camel case word is only a single letter long?
@CONTENT:I'm using Spring 4 MVC with Jackson 2 for my service. For one of the operations I have a request object that has an attribute where the leading camel case word this is only one letter in length: private String aLogId;
 This class has the appropriately named getters and setters: public String getALogId() { return aLogId; }
public void setALogId(String aLogId) { this.aLogId = aLogId; }
 However, when I attempt to post a request to this service using the corresponding JSON property: {"aLogId":"This is a log id"}
 I'm receiving a 500 response from the Spring framework saying the field is not recognized and my controller class is never called: Could not read JSON: Unrecognized field "aLogId" (class However, when I change the "L" to lower case, the request is deserialized as expected and my controller class is hit: {"alogId":"This is a log id"}
 Why does Jackson expect the "L" to be lower case when it is obviously the second word in the camel case convention for the attribute and intended to be in upper case? Is it because the first word is only a single letter long? There are other attributes in the request object where the first word is more than one letter and those attributed don't face this same issue with the mismatch in case.
@CODE:private String aLogId; public String getALogId() { return aLogId; }
public void setALogId(String aLogId) { this.aLogId = aLogId; } {"aLogId":"This is a log id"} {"alogId":"This is a log id"} logAId setaLogId getaLogId

@TITLE:How to create a dotted line with symmetrical corners
@CONTENT:I'm creating a dotted line from a UIBezierPath which looks like this: This is the code I use to construct and draw the path: const CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

const CGSize visibleSize = CGSizeMake(self.width - (kIndent * 2), self.height - (kIndent * 2));
UIBezierPath *borderPath = [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:CGRectMake(kIndent, kIndent, visibleSize.width, visibleSize.height) cornerRadius:kCornerRadius];
CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(context, [UIColor colorWithWhite:1.0 alpha:0.5].CGColor);
[borderPath setLineWidth:2.0];
[borderPath setLineCapStyle:kCGLineCapRound];

const CGFloat pattern[] = {6, 6};
[borderPath setLineDash:pattern count:2 phase:0];

 What I want is for each corner of my square to have the exact same curvatures as each other. I know this will ultimately be determined by my pattern values. I have tried calculating different values from the width of the shape (the width changes with screen width), but I can't get my desired look. Has anyone done this before, or have any ideas to share about how I'd do this?

@TITLE:Can Caffe classify pixels of an image directly?
@CONTENT:I would like to classify pixels of an image to "is street" or "is not street". I have some training data from the KITTI dataset and I have seen that Caffe has an IMAGE_DATA layer type. The labels are there in form of images of the same size as the input image. Besides Caffe, my first idea to solve this problem was by giving image patches around the pixel which should get classified (e.g. 20 pixels to the top / left / right / bottom, resulting in 41¡Ñ41=1681 features per pixel I want to classify. However, if I could tell caffe how to use the labels without having to create those image patches manually (and the layer type IMAGE_DATA seems to suggest that it is possible) I would prefer that. Can Caffe classify pixels of an image directly? How would such a prototxt network definition look like? How do I give Caffe the information about the labels? I guess the input layer would be something like layers {
  name: "data"
  type: IMAGE_DATA
  top: "data"
  top: "label"
  image_data_param {
    source: "path/to/file_list.txt"
    mean_file: "path/to/imagenet_mean.binaryproto"
    batch_size: 4
    crop_size: 41
    mirror: false
    new_height: 256
    new_width: 256
  }
}
 However, I am not sure what crop_size exactly means. Is it really centered? How does caffe deal with the corner pixels? What is new_height and new_width good for?
@CODE:IMAGE_DATA IMAGE_DATA layers {
  name: "data"

@TITLE:Convert `BufferedReader` to `Stream<String>` in a parallel way
@CONTENT:Is there a way to receive a Stream<String> stream out of a BufferedReader reader such that each string in stream represents one line of reader with the additional condition that stream is provided directly (before readerread everything)? I want to process the data of stream parallel to getting them from reader to save time. Edit: I want to process the data parallel to reading. I don't want to process different lines parallel. They should be processed in order. Let's make an example on how I want to save time. Let's say our reader will present 100 lines to us. It takes 2 ms to read one line and 1 ms to process it. If I first read all the lines and then process them, it will take me 300 ms. What I want to do is: As soon as a line is read I want to process it and parallel read the next line. The total time will then be 201 ms. What I don't like about BufferedReader.lines(): As far as I understood reading starts when I want to process the lines. Let's assume I have already my reader but have to do precomputations before being able to process the first line. Let's say they cost 30 ms. In the above example the total time would then be 231 ms or 301 ms using reader.lines() (can you tell me which of those times is correct?). But it would be possible to get the job done in 201 ms, since the precomputations can be done parallel to reading the first 15 lines.

@LINK:/questions/30176009/add-an-extension-method-to-all-objects-in-swift
@TITLE:Add an extension/method to all objects in Swift
@CONTENT:In Objective-C, all objects can be treated as type id, and nearly all objects inherit from NSObject. (Blocks don't, but that's about the only exception.) Thus it's possible to create an Objective-C category that extends ALL Objective-C objects. (ignoring blocks) In Objective-C, I created an extension to NSObject that uses associated objects to optionally attach a dictionary to any NSObject. That enabled me to implement methods setAssocValue:forKey: and assocValueForKey: that makes it possible to attach a key/value pair to any NSObject. This is useful in lots of circumstances. It makes it possible to add stored properties to a category, just for example. You just write a getter/setter that uses the associated value methods to attach a stored object, and away you go. It also makes it possible to attach values to existing system objects at runtime. You can hang data or blocks of code on buttons, or do whatever you need to do. I'd like to do the same thing in Swift. However, Swift does not have a common base class for all objects like Objective-C does. AnyObject and Any are protcols. Thus, extension AnyObject
 Won't compile. I'm at a loss as to where to "attach" my setAssocValue:forKey: and assocValueForKey: methods in Swift. I could create a base class for my extension, but that defeats the point of using an extension. I could make my base object an Objective-C NSObject, but that means all my objects have to be NSObjects, and Swift objects are not NSObjects by default. (BTW, this question applies to both the Mac OS and iOS platforms)

In comparison to this question on SO I do not want to touch the Http/Kernel definitions. During application initialization I check whether the requested hostname is known in the database and whether this hostname requires a redirect to a primary hostname or ssl. Because you don't want to touch the Http/Kernel as a package, we need to use the service provider. Requirements: dynamically add middleware without touching Http/Kernel use service provider and response object instead of "hacks"

Some windows I can DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE but some I need info from before they're disposed(). formWindowClosed seems only to fire when the window is disposed of, which I can't always rely on (see above & below) formWindowClosing seems to fire only when the user closes the window from the titlebar's system menu, even though I call System.exit(0) in my own menu action handler According do GC documentation, the dispose() method is not always called and is frequently ignored on app shutdown. I've added a ShutdownHook to run System.runFinalization() but the code is still not being executed. This may be too late anyways, as some windows will have been disposed of by then. How can I ensure that the code is run before the window is disposed of? It is a task that the window should be able to take care of, itself. I'm kind of frustrated at the unreliability of the Closed, Closing and dispose events. What am I missing?

@TITLE:Should I use GCM for real time communication between devices?
@CONTENT:I am making a chat application for android. For that, I decided to use GCM (Google Cloud Messaging). But having researched a bit about it,I have read that it shouldnt be used for something like chat. I will be implementing Upstream messaging (sending data from the device to the GCM directly, without a send-to-sync). Here are my concerns: Will the messages transfer instantly? (will be fast enough that the user can see 'typing'/seen) If all devices are online, what is the guarantee of the message from GCM reaching the client. The main reasons I want to use GCM is GCM uses the least amount of battery life This is an android-only app. If GCM is not what I should use, what should I use?

@TITLE:Need to convert AssetInputStream to FileInPutStream
@CONTENT:I have implemented a data structure which is working on my computer and now I am trying to port it into my android application. I open a raw .dat resource and get a InputStream but I need to get a FileInputStream: FileInputStream fip = (FileInputStream) context.getResources().openRawResource(fileID);
FileChannel fc = fip.getChannel();
long bytesSizeOfFileChannel = fc.size();
MappedByteBuffer mbb = fc.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0L, bytesSizeOfFileChannel);
...
 The code above throws the following exception since an InputStream can not be cast to a FileInputStream but that's just what I need: java.lang.ClassCastException: android.content.res.AssetManager$AssetInputStream cannot be cast to java.io.FileInputStream
 All my code is build on using this FileChannel with a FileInputStream so I want to keep using it. Is there a way to go from having an InputStream from context.getResources().openRawResource(fileID) and then convert it into a FileChannel? Somewhat relevant posts in which I could not find a working solution for my case which android: How to convert InputStream to FileInputStream Converting inputStream to FileInputStream?

@TITLE:Manipulate RMarkdown metadata from within R code chunks
@CONTENT:In short: Is there a way to manipulate RMarkdown's metadata-list generated from the YAML header from within the following R-code chunks? To illustrate, I've tried the following: ---
title: "Untitled"
output: html_document
---

```{r}
rmarkdown::metadata$title <- "New title"
rmarkdown::metadata$title
```
 This throws an error, though. Error in rmarkdown::metadata$title <- "New title" : 
  Object 'rmarkdown' not found
 Background I'm working on a RMarkdown TeX-template. Some parts of the preamble need to be localized depending on the variable lang defined in the YAML header. My current approach is to check the value of metadata$lang and create a list of corresponding terms. I wanted to add the contents of the list to metadata and access the terms in the TeX-template via $loc_wordcount$, for example.
@CODE:metadata ---
title: "Untitled"
output: html_document
---

```{r}

I forgot to add app/config/routing.yml and src/PDI/PDOneBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml at first so here them goes, perhaps this is the missing piece on the puzzle and give you a better idea of where the problem comes from: #app/config/routing.yml

@CONTENT:I have tried to be diligent in looking through documentation and am coming up empty. I am trying to factor or eliminate terms in a expression to matrix form. My problem appears to differ from polynomial factoring (as I plan to implement a function phi(x,y,z) = a_1 + a_2*x + a_3*y + a_4*z) import sympy
from sympy import symbols, pprint
from sympy.solvers import solve

phi_1, phi_2, x, a_1, a_2, L = symbols("phi_1, phi_2, x, a_1, a_2, L")

#Linear Interpolation function: phi(x)
phi = a_1 + a_2*x
#Solve for coefficients (a_1, a_2) with BC's: phi(x) @ x=0, x=L
shape_coeffs = solve([Eq(phi_1, phi).subs({x:0}), Eq(phi_2, phi).subs({x:L})], (a_1, a_2))
pprint(shape_coeffs)
#Substitute known coefficients
phi = phi.subs(shape_coeffs)
pprint(phi)
 This works as expected, however, I would like to factor this to matrix form, where : I have tried factor(), cancel(), as_coefficient() with no success. On paper, this is a trivial problem. What am I missing in the sympy solution? Thanks. A valid method: Taken as the answer C_1, C_2 = symbols("C_1, C_2", cls=Wild)
N = Matrix(1,2, [C_1, C_2])
N = N.subs(phi.match(C_1*phi_1 + C_2*phi_2))
phi_i = Matrix([phi_1, phi_2])
display(Math("\phi(x)_{answered} = " + latex(N) + "\ * " + latex(phi_i)))

@TITLE:UIPageViewController intermediate transitions programmatically?
@CONTENT:I have a UIPageViewController with n (n>>2) pages. The first page is yellow and the second one is blue. When I drag from one page to another I get a nice animation for the intermediate states as shown in the following image: I tried to make to page transition from one to another page programmatically. I got the UIScrollView as: for view:UIView in self.view.subviews as! [UIView] {
  if view.isKindOfClass(UIScrollView.self) {
    self.pageScrollView = view as? UIScrollView
  }
}
 The I set the scroll position like this: self.pageScrollView!.contentOffset.x = screenWidth - deltaX
 The result is the following: The scroll position is updated but the next view is not loaded. This is why there is a white area on the right site. I know I can set the next page with setViewControllers but this will reveal the entire next page. What I want here is to reveal the next page programmatically only partial as I did with the dragging. I know this can be done because the Tinder app is doing this already. When you make a pan gesture on the header the page view controller switches pages very smouth. How can I emulate the page intermediate transitions programmatically?
@CODE:UIPageViewController UIScrollView for view:UIView in self.view.subviews as! [UIView] {

@TITLE:MongoDB (server v 2.6.7) with C# driver 2.0: How to get the result from InsertOneAsync
@CONTENT:I am testing MongoDB (server v 2.6.7) with the C# driver 2.0. When I am using the insert function InsertOneAsync for a document with an _id which exists I am expecting an error like the one you get from the Mongo shell: WriteResult({
    "nInserted" : 0,
    "writeError" : {
            "code" : 11000,
            "errmsg" : "insertDocument :: caused by :: 11000 E11000 duplicate key error index: mydb.Commands.$_id_  dup key: { : 0.0 }"
    }})
 But the problem is that the insert with the C# driver does not throw an exception and I can not find the WriteResult for the insert. When I look in the database it seems nothing have happened. So my question is what to expect from InsertOneAsync when inserting an existing _id? The code in Visual Studio: IMongoCollection<BsonDocument> commandsCollection = db.GetCollection<BsonDocument>("Commands");
var bson = new BsonDocument
        {
            {"_id", i.Value},
            {"label", i.Key}
        };
commandsCollection.InsertOneAsync(bson);
@CODE:InsertOneAsync _id WriteResult({
    "nInserted" : 0,
    "writeError" : {
            "code" : 11000,
            "errmsg" : "insertDocument :: caused by :: 11000 E11000 duplicate key error index: mydb.Commands.$_id_  dup key: { : 0.0 }"
    }}) WriteResult InsertOneAsync _id IMongoCollection<BsonDocument> commandsCollection = db.GetCollection<BsonDocument>("Commands");
var bson = new BsonDocument
        {

@TITLE:Which rules determine whether an object is trivially copyable
@CONTENT:With the introduction of c++11, trivially copyableness has gotten quite relevant. Most notably in the use of 'std::atomic'. The basics are quite simple. A class foo is trivially copyable if: foo* src = new foo();
foo* dest = malloc(sizeof(foo));
memcpy(dest, src, sizeof(foo));
 Has the same effect as: foo* src = new foo();
foo* dest = new foo(src);
 So an object where copying the memory will have the same effect as a copy constructor. However there, of course, is a catch. There's not only copy constructors. But also move constructors, move assignment operators. Etc. std::is_trivially_copyable can be used to test whether an object is trivially copyable. So with trial and error it is possible to make an object trivially copyable. But of course a well defined set of rules would be a bit nicer:). So hereby my request.
@CODE:foo foo* src = new foo();
foo* dest = malloc(sizeof(foo));
memcpy(dest, src, sizeof(foo)); foo* src = new foo();
foo* dest = new foo(src);

@LINK:/questions/30095663/emit-dbcontext-onmodelcreating-on-every-context-creation
@TITLE:Emit DbContext.OnModelCreating on every context creation
@CONTENT:I use entity framework code first to work with my database. I have several tables with different names but same structure, and this tables dynamically appears in database. How could I map EntityFramework to one of that tables at run-time and use data from just like I work this over entities of DbContext? What I've done to make it work: For example, my class what describes structure of dynamically created table is SetElement. Here is my context: public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DataContext()
        : base("RepositoryConnectionString") { }

    string setElementsTableId; // the name of table that need to be dynamicly mapped to 

    // Enforce model recreating
    public DataContext(string setElementsTableId)
        : this()
    {
        this.setElementsTableId = setElementsTableId;
    }


    /* some other entities */

    public DbSet<Entities.SetElement> SetElements { get; set; } // dynamicly mapped entity


    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        /* come configurations */

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(setElementsTableId))
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<Entities.SetElement>().Map(x => x.ToTable(setElementsTableId)); // map SetElements property to dynamicly created table
        }
    }
}
 How I use this: public static void AddSetElements(ICollection<SetElement> setElements, string tableId)
    {
     using (ctx = new DataContext(tableId)) // configere DataContext to map tableId table for entity SetElements
       try
       {
           var num = ctx.SetElements.Count();
           ctx.SetElements.AddRange(setElements);
           ctx.SaveChanges();
       }
       catch (Exception e)
       {
       }
 }
 I have also some methods to get, udtate and remove data from dynamicly created tables that are same to AddSetElements. All works just as I wish but only if AddSetElements runs first, because at the first datacontext creating DbContext.OnModelCreating runs and configure all mappings. But next instance creation doesn't call DbContext.OnModelCreating. So, my question is: how to call DbContext.OnModelCreating everytime of creating an instance of DataContext then I use DataContext(string setElementsTableId) to create it? I know, my question is similar to 'dynamic table mapping in EF' but I found nothing in the results. By the way. If you know another way to solve my problem, you are welcome.
@CODE:SetElement public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DataContext()
        : base("RepositoryConnectionString") { }

    string setElementsTableId; // the name of table that need to be dynamicly mapped to 

    // Enforce model recreating
    public DataContext(string setElementsTableId)
        : this()
    {
        this.setElementsTableId = setElementsTableId;
    }


    /* some other entities */

    public DbSet<Entities.SetElement> SetElements { get; set; } // dynamicly mapped entity


    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {

            modelBuilder.Entity<Entities.SetElement>().Map(x => x.ToTable(setElementsTableId)); // map SetElements property to dynamicly created table
        }
    }
} public static void AddSetElements(ICollection<SetElement> setElements, string tableId)
    {
     using (ctx = new DataContext(tableId)) // configere DataContext to map tableId table for entity SetElements
       try
       {
           var num = ctx.SetElements.Count();
           ctx.SetElements.AddRange(setElements);
           ctx.SaveChanges();

@TITLE:VSO: Single project with a tiered area structure?
@CONTENT:Historically we have always had separate VSO Projects for each logical project undergoing development. This is particularly important as we need to have separate backlogs for each project. Each project has its own Product Owner. We have a team of around 10 developers who work between these projects over 2 week sprints. This setup has led to some serious issues when using VSO's Scrum tools: Multiple burndown, cumulative flow and velocity charts Split team member capacity during sprints This has made it very difficult to monitor work progress during sprints and to plan effectively for the next. This led me to create this StackOverflow question. Based on MrHinsh's answer, I can now have 1 VSO project and then split all the projects into areas: This means we have the following teams in Project (all "mapped" to their relevant areas): Project 1 Team Project 2 Team Project 3 Team Project 4 Team Would is be a good idea to add an extra tier to the area structure? For example, projects belong to some product. A logical grouping could be useful for reporting sake (velocity/burn date/etc). It would fit our organisational model quite well: From my understanding, we would then need to create two more teams: Product A Team Product B Team Additional questions: This would essentially mean that the Product A Team backlog would be an accumulation of the Project 1 and 2 backlogs. BUT, members could still add items to this backlog, which is somewhat wrong. Surely backlog items should only be created in Project 1 and 2? Is there no way of disabling this? I have been playing around with this in VSO and have found that no matter which Area a member belongs to, he/she always seems to have access to all areas in the Project. This means that access control isn't quite possible. Also, it means that I cannot "hide" the Product layer. Additionally, when navigating to a team area, there is no clear indication of the hierarchical structure (see screenshot below). This may be misleading for members. This would be another reason to hide such Product layers. I haven't found a way to do this.

@TITLE:Angular UI Router Reload Controller on Back Button Press
@CONTENT:I have a route that can have numerous optional query parameters: $stateProvider.state("directory.search", {
                url: '/directory/search?name&email',
                templateUrl: 'view.html',
                controller: 'controller'
 When the user fills the form to search the directory a function in the $scope changes the state causing the controller to reload:  $scope.searchDirectory = function () {
            $state.go('directory.search', {
                name: $scope.Model.Query.name,
                email: $scope.Model.Query.email
            }, { reload: true });                   
        };
 In the controller I have a conditional: if($state.params){return data} dictating whether or not my service will be queried. This works great except if the user clicks the brower's forward and/or back buttons. In both these cases the state (route) changes the query parameters correctly but does not reload the controller. From what I've read the controller will be reloaded only if the actual route changes. Is there anyway to make this example work only using query parameters or must I use a changing route?
@CODE:$stateProvider.state("directory.search", {

@TITLE:Escape/Special Characters from user input to HTML5 data-attributes using URL Encode/Decode
@CONTENT:This is my first question on stackoverflow - needing help from all you experts. Our web app allows the user to input escape/special characters. We are doing some testing for extreme cases. I'm able to pass the escape characters through ajax/json. var test = JSON.stringify({
  typeName: $("#typeName").val(),
  invoiceType: 'NewTypeArea'
});
$.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "BackEnd/WebService.php",
  data: {
    newInvoice: test
  },
  dataType: 'json'
}); <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script> My backend developer does their thing with escape/special characters. When I make another call I get the following JSON data [{"propName":"Special '\"'\\","typeName":"type'\"\\"}]
 This data returned is correct. For simplicity - I have only one object for this example - I take this data and put it into a dropdown list. $.each(data, function(i, val) {
var output = '<option class="type" id="' + this.qfInvoiceNum + '" value="' + this.typeName + '">' + this.typeName +'</option>';
$('select#typeList').append(output);
 }); It displays all the escape/special characters correctly. For instance: "type'\"\" displays as type'\"\ The user then selects one of the list items. I've tried capturing the typeName numerous ways with data-attributes, value, etc. Here is one example: $( '.selectChange1').change(function() {
typeGrab = $('select option.type:selected').val();
pullArea();
});
 But this is where the problem comes in. If they select a list item with special/escape characters the value from the console returns "type'"
 not "type'\"\\"
 So of course when I pass in the var typeGrab for the JSON/AJAX call it is wrong. Is there a good solution on on how to get escape/special characters from a dropdown? Or maybe I'm going wrong with $.each when I loop through the data? Or, quite possibly, I'm missing something very simple. Any help or insight would be great. Thank you. Additional Info. The first solution does work. However, I didn't use this initially due to the fact that there are a couple of times where the displayed text is not what I want to grab - which is why I was trying data*-attributes. For example: $.each(data, function(i, val) {
var output = '<option id="' + this.qfInvoiceNum + '" class="type" data-index="' + this.typeName + '" >' + this.typeName +' | #' + this.qfInvoiceNum +'</option>';
$('select#typeList').append(output);
}); 
 If I want the value of this.typeName with escape/special characters the provided solution does not work. I can't use data-attributes or the html option value. However, after much research, I found a great solution for this problem if you are looking to pass in values to data-attributes that have escape/special characters. Please my answer below.
@CODE:var test = JSON.stringify({
  typeName: $("#typeName").val(),
  invoiceType: 'NewTypeArea'
});
$.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "BackEnd/WebService.php",
  data: {
    newInvoice: test
  },
  dataType: 'json'
}); <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script> [{"propName":"Special '\"'\\","typeName":"type'\"\\"}] $.each(data, function(i, val) {
var output = '<option class="type" id="' + this.qfInvoiceNum + '" value="' + this.typeName + '">' + this.typeName +'</option>';
$('select#typeList').append(output); $( '.selectChange1').change(function() {
typeGrab = $('select option.type:selected').val();
pullArea();
}); "type'" "type'\"\\" $.each(data, function(i, val) {
var output = '<option id="' + this.qfInvoiceNum + '" class="type" data-index="' + this.typeName + '" >' + this.typeName +' | #' + this.qfInvoiceNum +'</option>';

@TITLE:WPF ListBox with CheckBox data template - Binding Content property of Checkbox not working
@CONTENT:I am following Kelly Elias' excellent article on making a WPF checkListBox. However, in my case, I have to create my objects in code using reflection. The ListBox item source is populating appropriately and the data template is styling the ListBox correctly, resulting in a list of CheckBoxes, but no Content is being shown for the CheckBox. What am I doing wrong with the binding in my data template? For brevity here, see the link above for the CheckedListItem class; mine is unchanged. The Charge class, of which we will type CheckedListItem: public class Charge
{
    public int ChargeId;
    public int ParticipantId;
    public int Count;
    public string ChargeSectionCode;
    public string ChargeSectionNumber;
    public string ChargeSectionDescription;
    public DateTime OffenseDate;
}
 The DataTemplate in XAML: <UserControl.Resources>
    <DataTemplate x:Key="checkedListBoxTemplate">
        <CheckBox IsChecked="{Binding IsChecked}" Content="{Binding Path=Item.ChargeSectionNumber}" />
    </DataTemplate>
</UserControl.Resources>
 The code behind: CaseParticipant participant = _caseParticipants.Where(q => q.ParticipantRole == content.SeedDataWherePath).FirstOrDefault();
ObservableCollection<CheckedListItem<Charge>> Charges = new ObservableCollection<CheckedListItem<Charge>>();

if (participant != null)
{
    foreach (Charge charge in participant.Charges)
    {
        Charges.Add(new CheckedListItem<Charge>(charge));
    }

    ((ListBox)control).DataContext = Charges;
    Binding b = new Binding() { Source = Charges };

    ((ListBox)control).SetBinding(ListBox.ItemsSourceProperty, b);
    ((ListBox)control).ItemTemplate = (DataTemplate)Resources["checkedListBoxTemplate"];
}
 The Result The ChargeSectionNumber property of the underlying Charges have the values "11418(b)(1)", "10", "11" and "13". Thank you for your assistance!

@TITLE:Multiple event handlers for the same event and element with Reactjs
@CONTENT:I'm writing an extended version of the input element. Here is a simplified version of it: var MyInput = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return (
            <div>
                <input type="text" onChange={this.changeHandler} {...this.props} />
            </div>
        );
    },

    changeHandler: function(event){
        console.log('Trigger me first');
    }
});
 I'm using it in a context like this: <MyInput placeholder="Test" value={this.state.myValue} onChange={function(event){
    console.log('Trigger me second');
}} />
 As you are probably suspecting one onChange overrides the other depending on the order of the attributes. With that in mind, what do you think would be the cleanest way to implement support for multiple event handlers for the same event, for the same element in cases like this one? Edit I was able to swap onChange and {...this.props} in the component and use changeHandler: function(event)
{
        console.log('input_changeHandler change');
        this.props.onChange(event);
}
 But I'm concerned if it's safe.
@CODE:var MyInput = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return (
            <div>
                <input type="text" onChange={this.changeHandler} {...this.props} />
            </div>
        );
    },

    changeHandler: function(event){
        console.log('Trigger me first');
    }
}); <MyInput placeholder="Test" value={this.state.myValue} onChange={function(event){
    console.log('Trigger me second');
}} /> onChange onChange {...this.props} changeHandler: function(event)
{
        console.log('input_changeHandler change');
        this.props.onChange(event);

In an equation for `it': it = foo True
 However, if I specify the return type, it works: foo True :: Int -- gives 0
 Why is this needed? The parameter type of Bool should be enough to resolve the ambiguity. Also: Is this the "best" way to achieve similar behaviour? (without renaming the functions to fooBool and fooDouble)
@CODE:{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

class MyClass a b where
    foo :: a -> b

instance MyClass Bool Int where
    foo True = 0
    foo False = 1

instance MyClass Double Double where
    foo x = -x foo True No instance for (MyClass Bool b0) arising from a use of `foo'
The type variable `b0' is ambiguous
Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
Note: there is a potential instance available:
  instance MyClass Bool Int -- Defined at test.hs:6:10
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (MyClass Bool b0)
In the expression: foo True
In an equation for `it': it = foo True foo True :: Int -- gives 0 fooBool fooDouble MultiParamTypeClasses Functional dependencies

 What happens is this (I ran gradlew uploadJavadoc --info --debug --stacktrace). You want to look at lines 611 and 664, where it says: could not put file: 425 Could not open data connection to port 55080: Connection timed out Apparently it works fine at least for Vazkii, the author of Botania, a minecraft mod, but it does not for me. The server I specified in private.properties works fine with a FTP client like FileZilla, I do not time out. I have also tried the same with a local FTP server, but since the transport has no bandwith limitation, the transport was instant. What can I do to prevent the timeout? And is the port 55080 something I should be concerned about? I also did some debugging earlier and I ensured the priv.host, priv.user and priv.pass variables contained the correct information.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to import a file into a MySQL table using Sequel Pro. I know I need to use STR_TO_DATE, but I can't figure out the right syntax. I'm getting a bunch of these errors for each row: [ERROR in row 1] You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'SET date = STR_TO_DATE(@'11/1/11', '%m/%d/%Y');,'Amazon','USD')' at line 2
 Here is what I'm doing: 1 File > Import. The file comes up and the date field in the CSV is row 14: 2) Select Date > Add expression 3) In the Expression window, add this code: $14, SET date = STR_TO_DATE(@$14, '%m/%d/%Y');
 4) Get this result: 5) Get error above. What is the right syntax? It may be helpful to give you an idea of the table I'm importing into: CREATE TABLE `Amazon_copy4` (
  `key` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

@TITLE:Importing and analysing non-rectangular .csv files in R
@CONTENT:I'm moving to R from Mathematica where I don't need to anticipate data structures during importation, in particular I do not need to anticipate the rectangularness of my data before import. I have many files .csv files formatted as follows: tasty,chicken,cinnamon
not_tasty,butter,pepper,onion,cardamom,cayenne
tasty,olive_oil,pepper
okay,olive_oil,onion,potato,black_pepper
not_tasty,tomato,fenugreek,pepper,onion,potato

 Rows have differing lengths and will only contain strings. In R, how should I approach this problem? What Have You Tried? I've tried with read.table: dataImport <- read.table("data.csv", header = FALSE)
class(dataImport)
##[1] "data.frame"
dim(dataImport)
##[1] 6   1
dataImport[1]
##[1] tasty,chicken,cinnamon
##6 Levels: ...
 I interpret this from the documentation to be a singular column with each list of ingredients as a distinct row. I may extract the first three rows as follows, each row is of class factor but appears to contain more data than what I expect: dataImport[c(1,2,3),1]
## my rows
rowOne <- dataImport[c(1),1];
class(rowOne)
## "factor"
rowOne
## [1] tasty,chicken,cinnamon
## 6 Levels: not_tasty,butter,cheese [...]
 This is as far as I've pursued this problem for now, I would appreciate advice on suitability of read.table for this data structure. My goal is to group the data by the first element of each row, and analyse the difference between each type of recipe. In case it helps influence data structure advice, in Mathematica I would do the following: dataImport=Import["data.csv"];
tasty = Cases[dataImport, {"tasty", ingr__} :> {ingr}]
 Answer Discussion @G.Grothendieck has provided a solution in using read.table and subsequent processing using the reshape2 package - this seems tremendously useful and I'll investigate later. General advice here solved my issue, hence accept. @MrFlick's suggestion of using the tm package was useful for later analysis using DataframeSource

@LINK:/questions/30095663/emit-dbcontext-onmodelcreating-on-every-context-creation
@TITLE:Emit DbContext.OnModelCreating on every context creation
@CONTENT:I use entity framework code first to work with my database. I have several tables with different names but same structure, and this tables dynamically appears in database. How could I map EntityFramework to one of that tables at run-time and use data from just like I work this over entities of DbContext? What I've done to make it work: For example, my class what describes structure of dynamically created table is SetElement. Here is my context: public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DataContext()
        : base("RepositoryConnectionString") { }

    string setElementsTableId; // the name of table that need to be dynamicly mapped to 

    // Enforce model recreating
    public DataContext(string setElementsTableId)
        : this()
    {
        this.setElementsTableId = setElementsTableId;
    }


    /* some other entities */

    public DbSet<Entities.SetElement> SetElements { get; set; } // dynamicly mapped entity


    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        /* come configurations */

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(setElementsTableId))
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<Entities.SetElement>().Map(x => x.ToTable(setElementsTableId)); // map SetElements property to dynamicly created table
        }
    }
}
 How I use this: public static void AddSetElements(ICollection<SetElement> setElements, string tableId)
    {
     using (ctx = new DataContext(tableId)) // configere DataContext to map tableId table for entity SetElements
       try
       {
           var num = ctx.SetElements.Count();
           ctx.SetElements.AddRange(setElements);
           ctx.SaveChanges();
       }
       catch (Exception e)
       {
       }
 }
 I have also some methods to get, udtate and remove data from dynamicly created tables that are same to AddSetElements. All works just as I wish but only if AddSetElements runs first, because at the first datacontext creating DbContext.OnModelCreating runs and configure all mappings. But next instance creation doesn't call DbContext.OnModelCreating. So, my question is: how to call DbContext.OnModelCreating everytime of creating an instance of DataContext then I use DataContext(string setElementsTableId) to create it? I know, my question is similar to 'dynamic table mapping in EF' but I found nothing in the results. By the way. If you know another way to solve my problem, you are welcome.
@CODE:SetElement public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DataContext()
        : base("RepositoryConnectionString") { }

    string setElementsTableId; // the name of table that need to be dynamicly mapped to 

    // Enforce model recreating
    public DataContext(string setElementsTableId)
        : this()
    {
        this.setElementsTableId = setElementsTableId;
    }


    /* some other entities */

    public DbSet<Entities.SetElement> SetElements { get; set; } // dynamicly mapped entity


    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        /* come configurations */

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(setElementsTableId))
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<Entities.SetElement>().Map(x => x.ToTable(setElementsTableId)); // map SetElements property to dynamicly created table
        }
    }
} public static void AddSetElements(ICollection<SetElement> setElements, string tableId)
    {
     using (ctx = new DataContext(tableId)) // configere DataContext to map tableId table for entity SetElements
       try
       {
           var num = ctx.SetElements.Count();

But I want to get the location's name (such as city name) in that way. Most primitive non-smart mobile phones (i.e Nokia 1110) show location name on the home screen.

@LINK:/questions/30077591/vso-single-project-with-a-tiered-area-structure
@TITLE:VSO: Single project with a tiered area structure?
@CONTENT:Historically we have always had separate VSO Projects for each logical project undergoing development. This is particularly important as we need to have separate backlogs for each project. Each project has its own Product Owner. We have a team of around 10 developers who work between these projects over 2 week sprints. This setup has led to some serious issues when using VSO's Scrum tools: Multiple burndown, cumulative flow and velocity charts Split team member capacity during sprints This has made it very difficult to monitor work progress during sprints and to plan effectively for the next. This led me to create this StackOverflow question. Based on MrHinsh's answer, I can now have 1 VSO project and then split all the projects into areas: This means we have the following teams in Project (all "mapped" to their relevant areas): Project 1 Team Project 2 Team Project 3 Team Project 4 Team Would is be a good idea to add an extra tier to the area structure? For example, projects belong to some product. A logical grouping could be useful for reporting sake (velocity/burn date/etc). It would fit our organisational model quite well: From my understanding, we would then need to create two more teams: Product A Team Product B Team Additional questions: This would essentially mean that the Product A Team backlog would be an accumulation of the Project 1 and 2 backlogs. BUT, members could still add items to this backlog, which is somewhat wrong. Surely backlog items should only be created in Project 1 and 2? Is there no way of disabling this? I have been playing around with this in VSO and have found that no matter which Area a member belongs to, he/she always seems to have access to all areas in the Project. This means that access control isn't quite possible. Also, it means that I cannot "hide" the Product layer. Additionally, when navigating to a team area, there is no clear indication of the hierarchical structure (see screenshot below). This may be misleading for members. This would be another reason to hide such Product layers. I haven't found a way to do this.

@TITLE:Angular UI Router Reload Controller on Back Button Press
@CONTENT:I have a route that can have numerous optional query parameters: $stateProvider.state("directory.search", {

                templateUrl: 'view.html',
                controller: 'controller'
 When the user fills the form to search the directory a function in the $scope changes the state causing the controller to reload:  $scope.searchDirectory = function () {
            $state.go('directory.search', {
                name: $scope.Model.Query.name,

            }, { reload: true });                   
        };
 In the controller I have a conditional: if($state.params){return data} dictating whether or not my service will be queried. This works great except if the user clicks the brower's forward and/or back buttons. In both these cases the state (route) changes the query parameters correctly but does not reload the controller. From what I've read the controller will be reloaded only if the actual route changes. Is there anyway to make this example work only using query parameters or must I use a changing route?

@TITLE:Escape/Special Characters from user input to HTML5 data-attributes using URL Encode/Decode
@CONTENT:This is my first question on stackoverflow - needing help from all you experts. Our web app allows the user to input escape/special characters. We are doing some testing for extreme cases. I'm able to pass the escape characters through ajax/json. var test = JSON.stringify({
  typeName: $("#typeName").val(),
  invoiceType: 'NewTypeArea'
});
$.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "BackEnd/WebService.php",
  data: {
    newInvoice: test
  },
  dataType: 'json'
}); <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script> My backend developer does their thing with escape/special characters. When I make another call I get the following JSON data [{"propName":"Special '\"'\\","typeName":"type'\"\\"}]
 This data returned is correct. For simplicity - I have only one object for this example - I take this data and put it into a dropdown list. $.each(data, function(i, val) {
var output = '<option class="type" id="' + this.qfInvoiceNum + '" value="' + this.typeName + '">' + this.typeName +'</option>';
$('select#typeList').append(output);
 }); It displays all the escape/special characters correctly. For instance: "type'\"\" displays as type'\"\ The user then selects one of the list items. I've tried capturing the typeName numerous ways with data-attributes, value, etc. Here is one example: $( '.selectChange1').change(function() {
typeGrab = $('select option.type:selected').val();
pullArea();
});
 But this is where the problem comes in. If they select a list item with special/escape characters the value from the console returns "type'"
 not "type'\"\\"
 So of course when I pass in the var typeGrab for the JSON/AJAX call it is wrong. Is there a good solution on on how to get escape/special characters from a dropdown? Or maybe I'm going wrong with $.each when I loop through the data? Or, quite possibly, I'm missing something very simple. Any help or insight would be great. Thank you. Additional Info. The first solution does work. However, I didn't use this initially due to the fact that there are a couple of times where the displayed text is not what I want to grab - which is why I was trying data*-attributes. For example: $.each(data, function(i, val) {
var output = '<option id="' + this.qfInvoiceNum + '" class="type" data-index="' + this.typeName + '" >' + this.typeName +' | #' + this.qfInvoiceNum +'</option>';
$('select#typeList').append(output);
}); 
 If I want the value of this.typeName with escape/special characters the provided solution does not work. I can't use data-attributes or the html option value. However, after much research, I found a great solution for this problem if you are looking to pass in values to data-attributes that have escape/special characters. Please my answer below.
@CODE:var test = JSON.stringify({
  typeName: $("#typeName").val(),
  invoiceType: 'NewTypeArea'
});
$.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "BackEnd/WebService.php",
  data: {
    newInvoice: test
  },

@CONTENT:I am following Kelly Elias' excellent article on making a WPF checkListBox. However, in my case, I have to create my objects in code using reflection. The ListBox item source is populating appropriately and the data template is styling the ListBox correctly, resulting in a list of CheckBoxes, but no Content is being shown for the CheckBox. What am I doing wrong with the binding in my data template? For brevity here, see the link above for the CheckedListItem class; mine is unchanged. The Charge class, of which we will type CheckedListItem: public class Charge

    public int ParticipantId;
    public int Count;
    public string ChargeSectionCode;
    public string ChargeSectionNumber;
    public string ChargeSectionDescription;
    public DateTime OffenseDate;
}
 The DataTemplate in XAML: <UserControl.Resources>
    <DataTemplate x:Key="checkedListBoxTemplate">
        <CheckBox IsChecked="{Binding IsChecked}" Content="{Binding Path=Item.ChargeSectionNumber}" />
    </DataTemplate>
</UserControl.Resources>
 The code behind: CaseParticipant participant = _caseParticipants.Where(q => q.ParticipantRole == content.SeedDataWherePath).FirstOrDefault();
ObservableCollection<CheckedListItem<Charge>> Charges = new ObservableCollection<CheckedListItem<Charge>>();

if (participant != null)
{
    foreach (Charge charge in participant.Charges)
    {

    }

    ((ListBox)control).DataContext = Charges;
    Binding b = new Binding() { Source = Charges };

    ((ListBox)control).SetBinding(ListBox.ItemsSourceProperty, b);
    ((ListBox)control).ItemTemplate = (DataTemplate)Resources["checkedListBoxTemplate"];
}
 The Result The ChargeSectionNumber property of the underlying Charges have the values "11418(b)(1)", "10", "11" and "13". Thank you for your assistance!

@TITLE:Multiple event handlers for the same event and element with Reactjs
@CONTENT:I'm writing an extended version of the input element. Here is a simplified version of it: var MyInput = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return (
            <div>
                <input type="text" onChange={this.changeHandler} {...this.props} />
            </div>
        );
    },

    changeHandler: function(event){
        console.log('Trigger me first');
    }
});
 I'm using it in a context like this: <MyInput placeholder="Test" value={this.state.myValue} onChange={function(event){
    console.log('Trigger me second');
}} />
 As you are probably suspecting one onChange overrides the other depending on the order of the attributes. With that in mind, what do you think would be the cleanest way to implement support for multiple event handlers for the same event, for the same element in cases like this one? Edit I was able to swap onChange and {...this.props} in the component and use changeHandler: function(event)
{
        console.log('input_changeHandler change');
        this.props.onChange(event);
}
 But I'm concerned if it's safe.
@CODE:var MyInput = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return (
            <div>
                <input type="text" onChange={this.changeHandler} {...this.props} />
            </div>
        );
    },

    changeHandler: function(event){
        console.log('Trigger me first');
    }
}); <MyInput placeholder="Test" value={this.state.myValue} onChange={function(event){
    console.log('Trigger me second');
}} /> onChange onChange {...this.props} changeHandler: function(event)
{
        console.log('input_changeHandler change');
        this.props.onChange(event);
}

@TITLE:It is possible to set the href attribute of a base tag in AngularJs?
@CONTENT:I want to set the href attribute value of base tag based on a constant value. To do so I've declared the base attribute in the head section as follow: <base ng-href="{{baseUrl}}">
 and I set the baseUrl value with this code snippet: app.run(["$rootScope","env", function($rootScope, env){   
    $rootScope.baseUrl = env.baseUrl;
}]);
 where env is the constant map. The locationProvider is configured in this way: .config(function ($locationProvider) {
 $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
})

 but in the console I get this error: Error: [$location:nobase] $location in HTML5 mode requires a <base> tag to be present!

@TITLE:Can I call rs.initiate() and rs.Add() from node.js using the MongoDb driver?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to automate the process of setting up a MongoDb replica set via a sidecar when using Docker and Kubernetes. The above setup isn't terribly important, what it boils down to is that I need to be able to call the mongo replica set commands (e.g. rs.initiate(), rs.add('anotherserver'), rs.conf(), rs.reconfig(), etc) from a node.js application. Note: it doesn't have to be from a node application, if someone knows of another way of getting the same thing done, please share your thoughts. UPDATE: I was able to get this working and have made the sidecar open source for others to use. https://github.com/leportlabs/mongo-k8s-sidecar https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/leportlabs/mongo-k8s-sidecar

@LINK:/questions/30039135/haskell-ad-hoc-polymorphism
@TITLE:Haskell ad hoc polymorphism
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get my head around ad-hoc polymorphism in haskell, that is having the same function provide different behaviour for different argument types. But while the following test code compiles {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

class MyClass a b where
    foo :: a -> b

instance MyClass Bool Int where
    foo True = 0
    foo False = 1

instance MyClass Double Double where
    foo x = -x
 if I try to call it using something like foo True
 ghci yells at me: No instance for (MyClass Bool b0) arising from a use of `foo'
The type variable `b0' is ambiguous
Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
Note: there is a potential instance available:
  instance MyClass Bool Int -- Defined at test.hs:6:10
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (MyClass Bool b0)
In the expression: foo True
In an equation for `it': it = foo True
 However, if I specify the return type, it works: foo True :: Int -- gives 0
 Why is this needed? The parameter type of Bool should be enough to resolve the ambiguity. Also: Is this the "best" way to achieve similar behaviour? (without renaming the functions to fooBool and fooDouble)

 What happens is this (I ran gradlew uploadJavadoc --info --debug --stacktrace).

The server I specified in private.properties works fine with a FTP client like FileZilla, I do not time out. I have also tried the same with a local FTP server, but since the transport has no bandwith limitation, the transport was instant. What can I do to prevent the timeout? And is the port 55080 something I should be concerned about? I also did some debugging earlier and I ensured the priv.host, priv.user and priv.pass variables contained the correct information.

@TITLE:Importing and analysing non-rectangular .csv files in R
@CONTENT:I'm moving to R from Mathematica where I don't need to anticipate data structures during importation, in particular I do not need to anticipate the rectangularness of my data before import. I have many files .csv files formatted as follows: tasty,chicken,cinnamon
not_tasty,butter,pepper,onion,cardamom,cayenne
tasty,olive_oil,pepper
okay,olive_oil,onion,potato,black_pepper
not_tasty,tomato,fenugreek,pepper,onion,potato

 Rows have differing lengths and will only contain strings. In R, how should I approach this problem? What Have You Tried? I've tried with read.table: dataImport <- read.table("data.csv", header = FALSE)
class(dataImport)
##[1] "data.frame"
dim(dataImport)
##[1] 6   1
dataImport[1]
##[1] tasty,chicken,cinnamon
##6 Levels: ...
 I interpret this from the documentation to be a singular column with each list of ingredients as a distinct row. I may extract the first three rows as follows, each row is of class factor but appears to contain more data than what I expect: dataImport[c(1,2,3),1]
## my rows
rowOne <- dataImport[c(1),1];
class(rowOne)
## "factor"
rowOne
## [1] tasty,chicken,cinnamon
## 6 Levels: not_tasty,butter,cheese [...]
 This is as far as I've pursued this problem for now, I would appreciate advice on suitability of read.table for this data structure. My goal is to group the data by the first element of each row, and analyse the difference between each type of recipe. In case it helps influence data structure advice, in Mathematica I would do the following: dataImport=Import["data.csv"];
tasty = Cases[dataImport, {"tasty", ingr__} :> {ingr}]
 Answer Discussion @G.Grothendieck has provided a solution in using read.table and subsequent processing using the reshape2 package - this seems tremendously useful and I'll investigate later. General advice here solved my issue, hence accept. @MrFlick's suggestion of using the tm package was useful for later analysis using DataframeSource

        HttpEntity entity = new StringEntity(usuari.toString());
        HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
        HttpDeleteWithBody httpDeleteWithBody = new HttpDeleteWithBody(getResources().getString(R.string.IPAPI) + "produsuaris/produsuari");

return resul;
 Furthermore, I've tried to do this: HttpDeleteWithBody delete = new HttpDeleteWithBody(getResources().getString(R.string.IPAPI) + "produsuaris/produsuari");
StringEntity se = new StringEntity(usuari.toString(), HTTP.UTF_8);
se.setContentType("application/json");

delete.setEntity(se);
 however, it doesn't work... the log says: D/Response ---------->¡R HTTP/1.1 200 OK This is how I call the method: JSONObject deleteproduct = new JSONObject();
try {
    deleteproduct.put("idProducte", String.valueOf(IDPROD));
    deleteproduct.put("idusuari", String.valueOf(IDUSU));
} catch (JSONException e) {
    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
    e.printStackTrace();
}
Log.i("Json test per afegir prod --> ", deleteproduct.toString());
TareaWSInsertar tarea = new TareaWSInsertar();
tarea.execute(String.valueOf(IDPROD), String.valueOf(IDUSU));
 I've added on my Google Chrome a plug-in called "PostMan" and when I try to do this by this way, it's deleting correctly... What I'm doing wrong? EDIT I tried to use cURL, and this is the result: It is returning me false, when I put the same JSON as PostMan; nevertheless, if I put the same JSON on PostMan, it works fine. EDIT 2 I implemented ion library and I did it like :  JSONObject usuari = new JSONObject();
            try {
                usuari.put("idProducte", params[0]);
                usuari.put("idusuari", params[1]);
            } catch (JSONException e) {
                // TODO Auto-generated catch block
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            try {
                String url = getResources().getString(R.string.IPAPI) + "produsuaris/produsuari";
                Log.d("CURL", "curl -X DELETE -d '" + usuari.toString() + "' " + url);

                Builders.Any.F builder = Ion.with(getActivity().getApplicationContext())
                        .load(HttpDelete.METHOD_NAME, url)
                        .setTimeout(15000).setStringBody(usuari.toString());


                String response = builder.toString();
                Log.d("TEST", "Req response -->" + response);
            }
            catch (Exception ex){
                resul = false;
            }
 And it still returning that it's OK, and don't delete anything.

@TITLE:Functional reactive operator for custom filter based on another Observable
@CONTENT:For fun and to learn I'm trying to implement an undo system in my app using functional reactive programming. I have a stream of state changes, which need to be saved onto the undo stack. When the user clicks undo, I take a value from the stack and update application state accordingly. The problem is that this update itself also generates an event in the state change stream. So what I would like is to derive another stream from state changes, which ommits state change right after undo. A simple diagram: states   ----S----S----S----
undos    -------U-----------     
save     ----S---------S----
 The first line is the stream of application state changes, the second line are undo events triggered by the user and the third line is the stream I'd like to implement and listen to instead of the first stream. What is the best way to express such intent in FRP?
@CODE:states   ----S----S----S----
undos    -------U-----------     
save     ----S---------S---- S1-U1-S0-S2 S1-S2 [{a:1}, {a:2}, {x: !0}, {a:3}, {a:4}, {a:5}].reduce(function(a,v){ if (v.x) {a.pop()} else a.push(v) ; return a; }, []) yourMergedStream.reduce(function removePreviousUndo(a,v) {/*...*/})

@LINK:/questions/30004793/running-same-asynctask-multiple-times-sequentially
@TITLE:Running same Asynctask multiple times sequentially
@CONTENT:I am trying to execute same Asynctask sequentially. For example, Let there be an Asynctask A. Now assume A checks if some server is busy or not. If it's busy, it checks again.... And so on. Let's say it checks this for 5 times then let users know that the service is unavailable. So same Asynctask can obviously be used. Trying to achieve it with loops may yield unexpected result as according to this link, Asynctask is a fire-and-forget instance and AsyncTask instances can only be used one time.. So looping 5 times means Asynctask will be called 5 times. But if the server is free on the 2nd attempt, I don't need additional checking. Also android application may hang(mine did). Correct me if I'm wrong on this topic. Also the answer was, "calling task like new MyAsyncTask().execute("");" So if i do like this -- for example, new someAsyncTask() {
            @Override
            protected void onPostExecute(String msg) {
                new someAsyncTask() {
                    @Override
                    protected void onPostExecute(String msg) {
                      ....and so on 5 times.
                   }
               }.execute(this);
            }
        }.execute(this);
 It should be called 5 times sequentially and no problems should occur. Is it the only way to do this or any other solution is present?
@CODE:calling task like new MyAsyncTask().execute(""); new someAsyncTask() {
            @Override
            protected void onPostExecute(String msg) {
                new someAsyncTask() {
                    @Override
                    protected void onPostExecute(String msg) {
                      ....and so on 5 times.
                   }
               }.execute(this);
            }
        }.execute(this);

@TITLE:backBarButtonItem image in iOS 8
@CONTENT:Assume that I have a ViewControllerA that points to ViewControllerB, I can set the title of Back button in ViewControllerB via this in ViewControllerA: navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(title: "", style: .Plain, target: nil, action: nil)  //set title to blank
navigationController?.pushViewController(destinationVC, animated: true)
 However, how can I replace the image? I tried this but I still only see the default "Back" image, instead of a custom image: navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(image: UIImage(named: "back-toolbar"), style: UIBarButtonItemStyle.Plain, target: nil, action: nil)
 I want to use this image: After reading many other SO posts, I don't want to implement a leftButtonItem for each destination view like ViewControllerB and have to manage the back Action and swipe left gesture. I also can't set the image in AppDelegate because I use one image for some views and another image for other views. UPDATE: Per @rounak's tip, I was able to set the backBarButton, but the position seems wrong. Any way to adjust it?
@CODE:ViewControllerA ViewControllerB ViewControllerB ViewControllerA navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(title: "", style: .Plain, target: nil, action: nil)  //set title to blank

@TITLE:Camel http4 download file using Basic authentication over Https
@CONTENT:I am trying to download a file from a Https url which requires Basic authentication. I am using HTTP4 I am trying to download from url - https://ebc.cybersource.com/ebc/DownloadReport/xxx.csv?authMethod=Basic&authUsername=scott&authPassword=tiger After the file is downloaded I need to save it to a folder. Here's what my code looks like from(xxx)
.to("http4://ebc.cybersource.com/ebc/DownloadReport/xxx.csv?authMethod=Basic&authUsername=scott&authPassword=tiger")
.to("file:target/messages/download");
 Here's the error I get - java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot consume from http endpoint

 Now the documentation says I need to use HttpContext,     public class HttpContextFactory {

  private String httpHost = "localhost";
  private String httpPort = 9001;

  private BasicHttpContext httpContext = new BasicHttpContext();
  private BasicAuthCache authCache = new BasicAuthCache();
  private BasicScheme basicAuth = new BasicScheme();

  public HttpContext getObject() {
    authCache.put(new HttpHost(httpHost, httpPort), basicAuth);

    httpContext.setAttribute(ClientContext.AUTH_CACHE, authCache);

    return httpContext;
  }

  // getter and setter
}
 I tried that but I am still getting errors. UPDATE I am actually using a quartz scheduler to trigger  from("quartz2://foo?cron=0/2+*+*+?+*+MON-FRI").multicast().stopOnException().to("direct:downLoadFile");

        from("direct:downLoadFile")
                .to("http4://ebc.cybersource.com/ebc/DownloadReport/2015/04/16/us_voip/us_voip.au.response.ss.csv?authMethod=Basic&authUserName=xxxx&authPassword=yyyy")
                .log("File Downloaded");
 When I run this I get the below error. [                          main] QuartzComponent                INFO  Starting scheduler.

 FINAL UPDATE: SOLVED Thanks to @Claus Ibsen who provided the correct component. All I had to was use use https4 instead of http. Note this information is missing in camel documentation. Here's the final code, that download the file from the website and saves in in target/download folder. import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;

/**

public class SchedulerRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    String userCredentials ="userName:Password";
    String basicAuth = "Basic " + new String(new Base64().encode(userCredentials.getBytes()));
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        //from("timer://foo?fixedRate=true&period=6000").to("bean:logBean?method=sayHello");

@TITLE:How to create item objects from reading a text file?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to read data from a text file and create Item Objects with it. Item Objects have fields String title, String formatt, boolean onLoan, String loanedTo and String dateLoaned. In my save()method, I print every object to a text file in a new line and the fields are seperated by "$" (dollar sign). How can I read the text file line by line and create a new object from each line and add it to an array. TextFile Example: StarWars$DVD$false$null$null Aliens$Bluray$true$John$Monday public void save() {
    String[] array2 = listForSave();

            printer.close();

    while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
        strings = line.split("\\$");
        String title = strings[0];
         String format = strings[1];
         boolean onLoan = Boolean.parseBoolean(strings[2]);
         String loanedTo = strings[3];
         String dateLoaned = strings[4];

         MediaItem superItem = new MediaItem(title,format, onLoan,loanedTo,dateLoaned);
         items.add(superItem);

    }
    fileReader.close();

@TITLE:Rails: Conditional path in form partial
@CONTENT:I have two forms for new and edit that I want to extract to a partial, but, to my begginer knowledge in Rails, they need different paths in order to work. This is my edit form: <%= simple_form_for [@user, @wiki], url: user_wiki_path do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title %>
  <%= f.input :body %>
  <%= f.submit class: "btn btn-success"  %>

<% end %>

@TITLE:Linking and UIC order in a CMake Qt project
@CONTENT:Talking about a Qt 5.3.2 project which is buildt using cmake. This is a calling order problem between UIC execution and target_link_libraries... unfortunately not in that order. Below this text you will find 1.) a (still functional) excerpt section of my CMakeLists.txt and 2.) an excerpt of the the output of the command 'cmake .' 3.) the output of a following call to 'make' without using the generated headers like 'ui_main.h'. If (in the source of my library libqt.a) I require 'ui_main.h' the make process crashes not finding the header. Looking at the non-crashing make output shows why: [..]
Scanning dependencies of target qt
[ 29%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/qt.dir/home/kochmn/projects/sentinel/src/qt/form_main.cpp.o
[ 35%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/qt.dir/qt_automoc.cpp.o
Linking CXX static library libqt.a
[..]
[ 52%] Generating ui_main.h
[..]
 Make would generate libqt.a before generating the required header file. So I experimented using code like target_link_libraries(sentinel
  ${Qt5Widgets_LIBRARIES} ${Qt5Gui_LIBRARIES} ${Qt5Core_LIBRARIES})

add_library(optimization "${DIR_SRC}/optimization/linalg.cpp")
add_library(qt "${DIR_SRC}/qt/form_main.cpp")

target_link_libraries(sentinel qt optimization)
 to no avail. The question: How can I motivate cmake to first run UIC generating the ui-header files and then compiling my libqt.a? Appendix # 2.8.11 instead of 2.8 required for automatic linking to the qtmain.lib
# library if this ever should expand to Windows.

@CONTENT:I recently started working on my Android app and I needed a login and registration system. I found a tutorial on androidhive.info but I constantly get errors. I'm using a volley library for sending HTTP requests and the error in LogCat is related to that library. I used a public IP address of my server on DigitalOcean and I think it might have something to do with that because in the tutorial they store the php scripts on localhost.

 In my class AppConfig I stored the path to location where the php scripts are (Public IP) package foi.hr.air.asocijacije.main;

public class AppConfig {

public static String URL_LOGIN = "http://95.85.57.105/android_login_api/";

public static String URL_REGISTER = "http://95.85.57.105/android_login_api/";
}
 And this is the error log that I'm getting in LogCat 04-29 11:35:18.440: E/Volley(1742): [180] BasicNetwork.performRequest:   Unexpected response code 500 for http://95.85.57.105/android_login_api/
04-29 11:35:18.916: E/RegisterActivity(1742): Registration error: null
 I hope that you can help me get this thing right, I tried using POST method on Mozilla plugin HttpRequester to try to store data in my online MySQL database just to be sure that the php scripts are working fine, but I don't know what content should I send in JSON format. If needed I will post additional data so you could understand where the problem is.

@TITLE:How to set same button events for ListBox (value) index or treeview nodes?
@CONTENT:I have C# Win-form as shown below. I also have few array as a menu for List-box. public string[] ArrayMain = {"1.Water","2.Air","3.Soil","4.Fire"};
public string[] ArrayWater = {"1.Salty","2.Fresh", "3.Contaminated"};
public string[] ArraySalty = {"1.AA", "2.BB", "3.CC"};
public string[] ArrayFresh = {"1.DD", "2.EE", "3.FF"};
public string[] ArrayContaminated = {"1.XX", "2.YY", "3.ZZ"} ;
public string[] ArrayAir = {"1.Fresh", "2.Contaminated"};
public string[] ArraySoil = {"1.Normal", "2.Contaminated"};
public string[] ArrayFire = {"1.Low","2.Mid","3.High"};
 When the application start in the Main List-box loaded with first array values. public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    ListBoxMain.Items.AddRange(ArrayMain);
    listView1.Items.Add(ArrayMain[0])
    // User choose: 1.Water
}
 If user press button 1 then application clears the Main List-box and loads with that selection. This time List-box loaded with; ListBoxMain.Items.AddRange(ArrayWater);
listView1.Items.Add(ArrayMain[0])
// User choose: 1.Salty
 Now if the user press button 2 then application clears the Main List-box and the Selected Menus List-Box will have values like; 1.Water 1.Salty 2.BB Then application will get the first letter (number) as fixed with format like; 112 and send it to WFC service. WFC services will know what to do with "112". My major problem is that I have to set all my button for List-box index (or combo-box as I say). Example if user press button 1 first time then user have to select that menus array into List-box. And again if user press button 1 then button 1 have to be connected List-box index (new values). In my previous question for this interesting problem user @Eugene suggested to me that I can turn the logic into tree-view. And he stated as; where nodes contain Items for combo-box (key-string to show, value - value to use later). When you push buttons you will add respective node item into some queue and load new items. In leaf nodes you will contain Action> that will call respective service method (for many options it can be the same action) I try to apply many logic and I spend nearly 10 days to make a simulator works as expected, but I failed. I realy like to have some information so I can set my button 1 events to ListBox (index) or Treview (nodes). If someone point me, even how to set my button 1 events as I stated above then rest will be easy for me. Kind Regards, First Time the app start: After the user press buttons:
@CODE:public string[] ArrayMain = {"1.Water","2.Air","3.Soil","4.Fire"};
public string[] ArrayWater = {"1.Salty","2.Fresh", "3.Contaminated"};
public string[] ArraySalty = {"1.AA", "2.BB", "3.CC"};
public string[] ArrayFresh = {"1.DD", "2.EE", "3.FF"};
public string[] ArrayContaminated = {"1.XX", "2.YY", "3.ZZ"} ;
public string[] ArrayAir = {"1.Fresh", "2.Contaminated"};
public string[] ArraySoil = {"1.Normal", "2.Contaminated"};
public string[] ArrayFire = {"1.Low","2.Mid","3.High"}; public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    ListBoxMain.Items.AddRange(ArrayMain);
    listView1.Items.Add(ArrayMain[0])
    // User choose: 1.Water
} ListBoxMain.Items.AddRange(ArrayWater);
listView1.Items.Add(ArrayMain[0])
// User choose: 1.Salty

@TITLE:Why does one .o file in my project has no Provisioning Profile?
@CONTENT:Im trying to submit a version of my app and after building im seeing the following screen My app has a valid provisioning profile except one .o file that is for some reason not included in it.. That has been the case for a while now, and i have managed to submit the app without it being a problem. A couple of day ago, after submiting a new version, i recived an email from apple saying : We have discovered one or more issues with your recent delivery for "xxx". To process your delivery, the following issues must be corrected: Invalid Signature - Code object is not signed at all. The binary at path [xxx.app/FooterCoverflowCollectionViewLayout.o] contains an invalid signature. Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level (which override any values at the project level). Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose "Clean All" in Xcode, delete the "build" directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target. For more information, please consult https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html Once these issues have been corrected, you can then redeliver the >corrected binary. Regards, The App Store team I've tried the steps they recommended with no luck. Can anyone have any idea how to solve the issue ?

@TITLE:GCDAsyncSocket multiple connections wont accept data from multiple sockets
@CONTENT:I am trying to write an app that connects to multiple sockets at the same time, i'm having trouble with receiving data from the old socket when a new one is connected.

}

func socket(socket : GCDAsyncSocket, didReadData data:NSData, withTag tag:Int32)
{
      //Do stuff like print data
}
 This is my structure to store the sockets struct serverlist 
{ 
    var Serveraddress = String(); 
    var socket = GCDAsyncSocket?();

 In my computer this C# code is taking about 5200ms to run, and the Java version is taking about 2800ms(!!!). I was actually expecting that the .NET version would run faster (or at least close to) than Java, but got very surprised with this result. Note: I ran the .NET version compiled in release mode, outside Visual Studio. Can somebody explain this result? Is this really right? How could I rewrite this code so that the C#.NET version gets closer to the Java one in execution speed? [edit] Well, I know this is not a really valid benchmarking or a fair comparison, but how could I rewrite this code so that the C#.NET version gets closer to the Java one in execution speed? Tried in any forms (manipulating the jagged array directly, via a getter, etc), but the test ran even slower. [edit 2] Edited the test so that I have width and height = 500, and loop = 5000. Now I get about 6300ms for .NET version, and about 3700ms for Java version. ran the test multiple times for each version, of course. [edit 3] Just wrote a similar test using flat arrays instead of 2D arrays, and this time the .NET version runs equally or even faster than Java. So is that it? C#.NET's jagged arrays are just slower than Java's multidimensional arrays?

@TITLE:java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found when loading DataFrame into Spark SQL
@CONTENT:I'm hitting very strange problem when trying to load JDBC DataFrame into Spark SQL. I've tried several Spark clusters - YARN, standalone cluster and pseudo distributed mode on my laptop. It's reproducible on both Spark 1.3.0 and 1.3.1. The problem occurs in both spark-shell and when executing the code with spark-submit. I've tried MySQL & MS SQL JDBC drivers without success. Consider following sample: val driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
val url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test"

val t1 = {
  sqlContext.load("jdbc", Map(
    "url" -> url,
    "driver" -> driver,
    "dbtable" -> "t1",
    "partitionColumn" -> "id",
    "lowerBound" -> "0",
    "upperBound" -> "100",
    "numPartitions" -> "50"
  ))
}
 So far so good, the schema gets resolved properly: t1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: int, name: string]
 But when I evaluate DataFrame: t1.take(1)
 Following exception occurs: 15/04/29 01:56:44 WARN TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, 192.168.1.42): java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql://<hostname>:3306/test

 When I try to open JDBC connection on executor: import java.sql.DriverManager

sc.parallelize(0 until 2, 2).map { i =>
  Class.forName(driver)
  val conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)
  conn.close()
  i
}.collect()
 it works perfectly: res1: Array[Int] = Array(0, 1)
 When I run the same code on local Spark, it works perfectly too: scala> t1.take(1)
...
res0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([1,one])
 I'm using Spark pre-built with Hadoop 2.4 support. The easiest way to reproduce the problem is to start Spark in pseudo distributed mode with start-all.sh script and run following command: /path/to/spark-shell --master spark://<hostname>:7077 --jars /path/to/mysql-connector-java-5.1.35.jar --driver-class-path /path/to/mysql-connector-java-5.1.35.jar
 Is there a way to work this around? It looks like a severe problem, so it's strange that googling doesn't help here.

@TITLE:Matlab: Calculating inverse of covariance matrix for time series model
@CONTENT:is an univariate autoregressive AR model of order p = 2 and data samples N excited by u which is a Gaussian zero mean noise and variance sigma_u^2. I am aware of the function cov(x) but how do I use it to get the pxp covariance matrix C(n) and its inverse, S(n) = C(n) for the coefficients of the AR model. The mathematical formula for inverse covariance matrix, S(n) is expressed as where A_1 and A_2 are the lower triangular Toeplitz matrices. Can I directly do pinv(Cov(coefficients))? I am also unsure how to pass the arguments as the AR coefficients into the function. How to implement this formula? thank you for help

@TITLE:Ember Handling 401s Revisited in 2015
@CONTENT:I can find a ton of old questions asking/answering how to handle 401s from the Rails backend in Ember/Ember Data. Many, if not all, seem to be outdated at this point. I have tried everything I could find. (Ember-Data handling 401¡¦s) But no matter what I do I just keep getting 401 errors in the console while the 401s are never caught in my code. All I want to do is add a redirect to '/' if a 401 is ever encountered in any place/model/anything. I don't need any checking for authentication or anything else. I have tried adding this to the Application Route actions as well as to to the Router itself. error: function (error, transition) {
  console.log("err: " + error.status);
  if (error && error.status === 401) {
    return this.transitionToRoute('/');
  }
}
 I've also tried several variations of this http://stackoverflow.com/a/19063009/1850353. App.ApplicationAdapter = DS.RESTAdapter.extend({
  ajaxError: function(jqXHR) {
    var error = this._super(jqXHR);
    console.log("jqXHR: " + jqXHR.status);
    if (jqXHR && jqXHR.status === 401) {
      #handle the 401 error
    }
    return error;
  }
});
 I'm obviously a noob so maybe I'm missing something simple here. None of my console.log's are getting triggered unless it's for a new error I've introduced trying to get this to work. Is there a current, 'best practice' style way of doing this?
@CODE:error: function (error, transition) {
  console.log("err: " + error.status);
  if (error && error.status === 401) {
    return this.transitionToRoute('/');
  }
} App.ApplicationAdapter = DS.RESTAdapter.extend({
  ajaxError: function(jqXHR) {

@LINK:/questions/29925510/generic-design-mixed-with-curiously-recurring-template-pattern-c
@TITLE:Generic design mixed with curiously recurring template pattern. C++
@CONTENT:Consider this kind of problem. I have a Base class and three classes derived from Base. For instance: DerivedA, DerivedB and DerivedC. Each derived class has its unique container. Hence DerivedA has std::vector<int>, DerivedB has std::set<int> and DerivedC has std::map<int, std::string>. And I want an interface in Base to access the container of derived class on which it is currently pointed to. Base* d1 = new DerivedA;
for(std::vector<int>::iterator iter = d1->begin(); iter != d1->end(); ++iter)
{
     //processing
}
 I tried to wrap each container to separate class and keep a pointer of their base in the Base class. class CollA;

template<class T>
class traits;

template<>
class traits<CollA>
{
  public:
  typedef vector<int> container; 
};


template<class T>
class Coll
{
  public:
    typedef typename traits<T>::container container;
    typename container::iterator begin() const
    {
    }
};


class CollA : public Coll<CollA>
{
  typedef traits<CollA>::container container;
  public:
    container::iterator begin()
    {
      return V.begin();
    }
    private:
    vector<int> V;
};

class Base
{
  public:
    Base()
    {
    }
    // what to do here? I must keep a pointer to Coll; But Coll itself is a template
};
 Suggest me something. I am kind of lost in this horrible design.

@CONTENT:I am working on xcode 6.3.1, OSX 10.10.3 and I have configure crashlytics successfully with my local system. it work fine and it release the build via fabric app. But when I transfer same codebase to teamcity it was showing me following error fatal error: 'Fabric/Fabric.h' file not found fatal error: 'Crashlytics/Crashlytics.h' file not found After investigation, I found that following unknown issue in my teamcity server. Teamcity got the source from git and when I see the source code in teamcity, Crashlytics.framworks & fabric.framworks are available but when you look into folder structure it could not figure out shortcuts for all headers, modules, resources, crashlytics folder (pic-1). I get the other git clone in other folder and manually pull source code, here I can see the all shortcuts for crashlytics & fabrics sub folders. (pic-2). I just copied all folders and pasted in teamcity source code. Now it works but every time when source code changed, teamcity reset to non-shortcut folder structure which will fail my builds. I am not sure this is GIT issue or teamcity or crashlytics issue. Please let me know how to figure out. I appreciate you answers. Thanks Manoj

     },
     "count": {
       "$sum": "$msisdnCount"
     }
   }
 });
 This is giving right result on the basis of time in miliseconds and msisdns - I have to convert time(milliseconds) in date in my query so that it will filter data on the basis of date not on exact time in milliseconds. What is the solution ?

@LINK:/questions/29884776/how-to-inspect-mvc-response-stream-using-owin-middleware-component
@TITLE:How to inspect MVC response stream using OWIN middleware component?
@CONTENT:This question has been asked before in a few forms but I cannot get any of the answers to work, I'm losing my hair and unsure if the problem is just that the solutions were from 2 years ago and things have changed. How can I safely intercept the Response stream in a custom Owin Middleware - I based my code on this, it looks like it should work, but it doesn't OWIN OnSendingHeaders Callback - Reading Response Body - seems to be a different OWIN version, because method signature doesn't work What I want to do is write an OMC that can inspect the response stream from MVC. What I did (amongst several other attempts), is to add an OMC that sets context.Response.Body to a MemoryStream, so I can rewind it and inspect what was written by downstream components:     public async Task Invoke(IDictionary<string, object> env)
    {

        IOwinContext context = new OwinContext(env);

        // Buffer the response
        var stream = context.Response.Body;
        var buffer = new MemoryStream();
        context.Response.Body = buffer;
        .......
 What I find is that the MemoryStream is always empty, unless I write to it from another OMC. So it seems that downstream OMCs are using my MemoryStream, but MVC responses are not, as if the OWIN pipeline completes before the request goes to MVC, but that's not right is it? Complete code: public partial class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        ConfigureAuth(app);
        app.Use(new ResponseExaminerMiddleware());

        // Specify the stage for the OMC
        //app.UseStageMarker(PipelineStage.Authenticate);
    }


}




public class ResponseExaminerMiddleware
{
    private AppFunc next;

    public void Initialize(AppFunc next)
    {
        this.next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(IDictionary<string, object> env)
    {

        IOwinContext context = new OwinContext(env);

        // Buffer the response
        var stream = context.Response.Body;
        var buffer = new MemoryStream();
        context.Response.Body = buffer;

        await this.next(env);

        buffer.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        var reader = new StreamReader(buffer);
        string responseBody = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();

        // Now, you can access response body.
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(responseBody);

        // You need to do this so that the response we buffered
        // is flushed out to the client application.
        buffer.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        await buffer.CopyToAsync(stream);

    }

}
 For what it's worth I also tried a suggestion where the response.Body stream is set to a Stream subclass, just so I could monitor what is written to the stream and bizarrely the Stream.Write method is called, but with an empty byte array, never any actual content...
@CODE:public async Task Invoke(IDictionary<string, object> env)
    {

        IOwinContext context = new OwinContext(env);

        // Buffer the response
        var stream = context.Response.Body;
        var buffer = new MemoryStream();
        context.Response.Body = buffer;
        ....... public partial class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        ConfigureAuth(app);
        app.Use(new ResponseExaminerMiddleware());

        // Specify the stage for the OMC
        //app.UseStageMarker(PipelineStage.Authenticate);
    }


}




public class ResponseExaminerMiddleware
{
    private AppFunc next;

    public void Initialize(AppFunc next)
    {
        this.next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(IDictionary<string, object> env)
    {

        IOwinContext context = new OwinContext(env);

        // Buffer the response
        var stream = context.Response.Body;
        var buffer = new MemoryStream();
        context.Response.Body = buffer;

        await this.next(env);

        buffer.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        var reader = new StreamReader(buffer);
        string responseBody = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();

        // Now, you can access response body.
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(responseBody);

        // You need to do this so that the response we buffered
        // is flushed out to the client application.
        buffer.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        await buffer.CopyToAsync(stream);

@TITLE:Using ES6 modules with traceur in single build file
@CONTENT:I just have a simple question cant get in any place, heve been googling for it all morning. There is no much info about traceur and when there is is not so clear, at least to me. How should be implemented the ES6 modules when im transpiling with traceur a single output file and using it in the browser with traceur-runtime? import and export keeps getting Unexpected token. I am using gulp-traceur and tried already all the modules options //'commonjs' //'amd', 'commonjs', 'instantiate', 'inline', 'register'. One doubt I have is that I keep finding answers about commonjs, but my idea of using ES6 modules is to have differents sources and then from the main import them and have all this result compiled in one single file (what i mean is that I dont need async loading of the modules in the browser) Here is the gulp task gulp.task('scripts', function() {
      del.sync(['bin/js/main.min.js']);
      del.sync(['bin/js/main.min.js.map']);
      gulp.src(["./src/app/init.js", "./src/app/elements/circle.js", "./src/app/app.js"])
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(traceur({modules : 'inline', sourceMaps: 'inline', experimental: "true"})) //'commonjs' //'amd', 'commonjs', 'instantiate', 'inline', 'register'
          .on('error', errorParser)
        .pipe(jshint())
          .pipe(jshint.reporter('jshint-stylish'))
        .pipe(uglify({mangle: true})).on('error', errorParser)
        .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('.'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('bin/js'))
        .pipe(livereload({ auto: true }));
    });
 The unexpected token comes from app when importing import Circle from './elements/circle';
 or import * as Circle from './elements/circle.js';
 (Tried several ways) Also from circle.js when exporting export default Circle; or export Circle; (also tried several ways)
@CODE:gulp.task('scripts', function() {
      del.sync(['bin/js/main.min.js']);
      del.sync(['bin/js/main.min.js.map']);
      gulp.src(["./src/app/init.js", "./src/app/elements/circle.js", "./src/app/app.js"])
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(traceur({modules : 'inline', sourceMaps: 'inline', experimental: "true"})) //'commonjs' //'amd', 'commonjs', 'instantiate', 'inline', 'register'
          .on('error', errorParser)
        .pipe(jshint())

@LINK:/questions/29880908/display-labels-only-to-specific-cities-in-google-maps
@TITLE:Display labels only to specific cities in Google Maps
@CONTENT:I have polylines connecting two points on the map. I want to display labels only for those two points, and hide all other labels. I have explored the Google Maps API to see how Styled Maps work. Using the hiding features, I could achieve hiding and display of labels at various granularities, but what I fail to achieve displaying only two city labels. For instance, if I have a line connecting, San Jose and New York, only San Jose and New York labels should be displayed on the maps, with all other labels hidden. Currently what I see is that I can hide labels at administrative.province level, but it hides San Jose and New York labels as well. Here's a snippet of code that I have for polyline and hiding some features. <!DOCTYPE html>

@TITLE:Questions about using a Radix Tree in android for English dictionary word-lookup in 240k word-list
@CONTENT:App Overview In this game you append a letter to growing chain of letters, but each player tries not to form a word. You have the option to say it's a word after your opponent chose a letter to append to the chain of letters, which needs to be checked to a certain data-structure. I need to implement this data-structure. Requirements of Data-structure I need a data-structure that is able to tell fast if a word exists in a list of 240000 words for a game on an android device. You should be able to play up to 20 games easily Should be written for an android app A nice extra feature would also be to quickly show all possible words from a given word but is not necessary. What I tried A Radix Tree seemed like a good idea for this, see the picture below. Now I might regret the time I put into this, since I think it would require too many objects. Every black dot as well as the numbered circles would be represented as node objects in my code. A radix tree would require at the bare minimum 240k (240,000) nodes and thus objects, each path to every node would be one word, which would result in the 240k word list. Each game would be represented only storing a reference to the current node in the tree, meaning that an extra game requires little extra storage. I also thought that I could implement it as a hashMap with all possible words in it and loop through all the words and narrow down after each letter. This seems like a computational approach, where the Radix Tree would require less computations but a lot more storage. [EDIT] This was a wrong assumption of mine, look below at the picture. Questions I have Is a Radix Tree one of the best data-structure for the requirements given most android devices used today? (answers/comments seem to indicate it is) How does it work in memory when you have so many objects? Are they all stored in ram or also on the disk? I could find this that an app could use a total of 16mb/25mb/32mb of ram. Is it likely I will reach over 16mb of ram when putting 240000 object in ram? You can store and retrieve the large Radix Tree object during runtime from a file right? Which is stored to a disk in the res/raw folder. Would having (let's say) 50 games open with a hash-map in which for every game you have to use a copy of the hashmap, on which you narrow down the possible words, be even possible? How much additional storage can an application claim after installation? Based on the comments: It seemed like my assumption that a Radix Tree would require more space seemed wrong: To see the image larger right click on it and open in new tab

@TITLE:declared Swift empty Array is treated as NSArray if i am not giving type annotation
@CONTENT:while i am playing with Swift Array i came across a problem. Here below is my experiment. var iArray = [] //Here if i see the type details in quick help it is of NSArray type.

var myArray = [Int]() //Here if i see the type details in quick help it is of Swift Array<Int> type.
 Now if i check like below if iArray is NSArray { //it gives error saying it is always true, which is correct.
   println("Confused")
}
if iArray is Array<String> { //Here it is true and printing the message and same is also true if i check for Array<Int>
   println("More Confused")
}
 As per documentation, Swift Arrays are equivalent to NSArray. Should i understand that quick help is giving wrong information? More explanation would be great at this point.
@CODE:var iArray = [] //Here if i see the type details in quick help it is of NSArray type.

var myArray = [Int]() //Here if i see the type details in quick help it is of Swift Array<Int> type. if iArray is NSArray { //it gives error saying it is always true, which is correct.
   println("Confused")
}
if iArray is Array<String> { //Here it is true and printing the message and same is also true if i check for Array<Int>

@TITLE:nameof with Generics
@CONTENT:I was experimenting with nameof with generics. I didn't get the result I was expecting. I'm not sure if this is part of the spec or not. class MainClass
{
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ($"Hello { nameof(FooBar<string>)! }");
    }
}

class FooBar<T> { }
 The output I get is Hello FooBar! I would expect some details about the type parameters. I tried it with a method and that fails with a compiler error: class MainClass
{
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ($"Hello { nameof(Do<string>) }");
    }

    public static T Do<T>() {}
}
 Error CS8084: An argument to nameof operator cannot be method group with type arguments (CS8084) (foo) Is this because nameof is a compile-time construct and generics are types initialized at runtime? Or is there some other limitation?
@CODE:nameof class MainClass

    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ($"Hello { nameof(FooBar<string>)! }");

 If I remove the handler, the problem goes away. I've found one possible solution called groundhog that captures and stores all requests. The library I'm using, clojure-paypal-ipn originally called reset on the stream, but that is not supported by Undertow (or indeed several other Java/Clojure servers), so I worked around it. Here is a related discussion with weavejester, author of compojure. Here are some snippets of my code: (defroutes routes
  ...
  (POST "/paypal/ipn" [] (payment/paypal-ipn-handler 
                          payment/paypal-data 
                          payment/paypal-error 
                          paypal-sandbox?))
  (route/resources "/"))

(defn authenticate-routes

  [routes-set]

      ;; wrap the handler with websocket support
      ;; websocket requests will go to the callbacks, ring requests to the handler
      (web-middleware/wrap-websocket websocket-callbacks))
    args))
 And here are the guts of payment.clj (paypal-data and paypal-error just pprint input right now): (defn req->body-str [req]

 I have tried different settings (NTS, none, all) and changed the connection string to User Id=XXX;password=XXX;Data Source=MyDataSource;, but the error stays the same. Questions What could be causing the ORA-12537 network session end of file exception? Is a reference / dependency missing? Does something have to be configured on the DB server? UPDATE On the server we are getting an ORA-12679: Native services disabled by other process but required error in the alert.log. It seems to have something to do with the encryption. Commenting out the following lines in the servers sqlnet.ora solves the issue. #SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES=(NTS)
#SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER = (rc4_128, rc4_256)
#SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER=REQUIRED
#ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION=
#          (SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=
#                  (DIRECTORY=...\%ORACLE_SID%\wallet)))
 New question How do we configure ManagedDataAccess so it works with the encryption? Update 2 Seems to work now with ODP Managed Driver 12c: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Oracle.ManagedDataAccess/

@CONTENT:while learning through ajax in jQuery, I came accross 2 terms, viz., $.ajaxPrefilter() and $.ajaxSetup(). All I can find out is that these make some changes in ajax before loading or making call to $.ajax(). Can someone simplify and explain these terms in eaziest form along with a slight comparison of the two? http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxprefilter/ http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ I specifically dont understand these 4 VOTEDOWNS. I would like 100 people to vote down, BUT after atleast providing valid responses or answering my question. Some facts about this question: 1) I did not find similar question asked before. 2) I really did not understand the concept behind these 2 points. 3) I provided the links of appropriate explainations, that shows I did atleast some research. 4) NO question is a bad question or foolish question. 5) You yourself do not understand the concept, if you cant explain to a 6 year old kid. 6) If after these 5 valid points you ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY ANSWERS, just voting it down sitting back in AC Rooms, and hunting yourself as Captain Charisma, I think you are those kind of people, who need to understand they are nothing more than Bucky Old Pathetic Ducks!

@TITLE:What is the compatible subset of Intel's and AMD's x86-64 implementations?
@CONTENT:While learning x86-64 assembly, I came across my first incompatibility between Intel 64 and AMD64 implementations of "x86-64": Why does syscall compile in NASM 32 bit output while popa does not compile in 64 bit? syscall is valid in the compatibility mode of one but not the other. Is there a better way of finding out those incompatibilities besides carefully reading both manuals and comparing them, which is error prone and duplicates my manual reading effort when aiming for portability? For example, it would be much easier if there was either: a standard subset which both Intel and AMD claim to follow comments on the Intel manual about AMD compatibility since AMD was the one to invent x86-64. But of course, this would be hard for Intel to maintain, and the Intel manuals don't contain the word AMD. some general official or non-official guideline which assures compatibility of certain parts. For example, something like: compatibility mode may be incompatible, but 64-bit mode not. some well maintained list of incompatibilities by Intel, AMD or some third party

@TITLE:Rotate a quaternion by Euler angles input
@CONTENT:I am writing a code to control robotic arm in 3D space. The robotic arm handle the rotation by quaternion but I want user to control it by changing yaw, pitch and roll since its more sensible for human to use these. I wrote function to get the amount that user wants to rotate the arm in each of directions(roll, pitch, yaw) and output the new quaternion. I saved the current_quaternion as a global variable. I am using C++ and Eigen. Eigen::Quaterniond euler2Quaternion( const double roll,
              const double pitch,
              const double yaw)

Eigen::AngleAxisd yawAngle(yaw,Eigen::Vector3d::UnitZ());

Eigen::Quaterniond q = rollAngle*pitchAngle*yawAngle;
current_q=q*current_q;
return current_q;
}
 I tried many things changing the order of multiplying angles and multiplying UnitX(), UnitY() and UnitZ() by current_q.toRotationMatrix() but non of them worked.

@LINK:/questions/29828746/extending-parent-state-with-extra-views
@TITLE:Extending parent state with extra views
@CONTENT:Using: AngularJS and UI-Router. I am trying to create a page that has two views: menu and main. One is for a menu and the other is for whatever content there may be. However, I do not want to define both views in all states every time. The menu view will not change too often. So I created a parent 'root' state which contains only the menu view. The other states then derive from this and add appropriate views. The code looks like this (in a file app.js): angular
    .module('Admin', ["ui.router"])
    .config(["$stateProvider", function($stateProvider) {
        $stateProvider.state('root', {
            abstract: true,
            views: {
                "menu": {
                    templateUrl: "../static/partials/menu.html",
                    controller: "MenuController"
                }
            }
        }).state('root.main', {
            url: "",
            parent: 'root',
            views: {
                "main": {
                    templateUrl: "../static/partials/landing.html",
                    controller: "MainController"
                }
            }
        }).state('root.login', {
            url: "/login",
            parent: 'root',
            views: {
                "main": {
                    templateUrl: "../static/partials/login.html",
                    controller: "LoginController"
                }
            }
        })
        ;
    }])
    .controller('MainController', ["$scope", "$http", mainController])
    .controller('MenuController', ["$scope", "$http", menuController])
    .controller('LoginController', ["$scope", "$http", loginController])
    ;
 The result is that only the menu view is displayed. The main view is not displayed, unless I also add it to the root state. Anyone know what is wrong? EDIT The HTML that contains the views: <div ng-app="Admin">
    <a ui-sref="root.main">Click me</a>
    <div class="ui menu" ui-view="menu"></div>
    <div class="ui segment">
        <div ui-view="main"></div>

<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/main_controllers.js') }}"></script>
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/app.js') }}"></script>

@TITLE:Optimizing string parsing with Python
@CONTENT:I have string in the form 'AB(AB(DDC)C)A(BAAC)DAB(ABC)'. Each character represents an element (A, B, C or D). Between parentheses, on the right, there is the child of each element (which may be absent). In example, having 'AB(AB(DDC)C)A(BAAC)DA', the top level would be AB(AB(DDC)C)A(BAAC)DA --> [A, B, A, D, A] and the corresponding children would be [None, AB(DDC)C, BAAC, None, None]. The children are to be parsed as well recursively. I have implemented a solution here: def parse_string(string):

 Although I think it's a bit ugly and I'm sure it is not very efficient. I wonder if there's a way to make this with Python in a cleaner/faster/more elegant way? Using external libraries is allowed (specially if they're written in C! :-P). Update Other examples of strings that should work: ABC(DAB(ACB)BBB(AAA)ABC)DCB In general, the length of the string is not limited, neither the number of children, nor their length, nor the number of nested levels.

@LINK:/questions/29797111/why-is-my-facebook-appinvitedialog-request-not-being-received-by-target-friend
@TITLE:Why is my Facebook AppInviteDialog request not being received by target friend?
@CONTENT:In short: Everything seems to be working on the client side, but nothing received for the Facebook target friend. These are the detailed steps with code and screenshots: AppInviteContent content = new AppInviteConent.Builder()
    .setApplinkUrl("App link url created via the Facebook AppLink creator tool")
    .setPreviewImageUrl("http://www.redacted.com/previewImage.png")
    .build();

appInviteDialog.show(this, content);
 This results in a dialog being shown with a preview of a link to the install of the app, and the option of entering a message at the top: I then click next, select one or more friends and click the top right Send button: The result is a seemingly successful send: I attached a callback as well to make sure it was actually a successful send: appInviteDialog.registerCallback(facebookCallbackManager, new FacebookCallback<AppInviteDialog.Result>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(AppInviteDialog.Result result) {
    Log.d(TAG,"onSuccess result = "+ result.getData().toString()); 
    }

    @Override
    public void onCancel() {}

    @Override
    public void onError(FacebookException e) {
        Log.d(TAG,"onError message = "+ e.getMessage());
    }
});
 This prints out "onSuccess result = Bundle[{didComplete=1}]" Expected result: Friend receives a notification. Actual result: Friend receives nothing. Some more information that might be helpful: App is only available on android. Notification is not received on any platform including Facebook android app. The App link url has been confirmed working by clicking on it in the Facebook android app. (It creates a popup linking to the Google Play Store) Single Sign On has been enabled and user is logged in, although should not be necessary according to the AppInviteDialog documentation on Facebook. Tried this with the target user not already having authorized the app, and also with user that already had the app installed. Same results. The Facebook SDK version I am using is 4.0.0 It's frustrating because everything seems OK, and there is no way (that I know of) to debug this problem. I hope someone can help me or point me in the right direction. Thank you!

# The next tree fields set the sources, sinks and channels used by Cygnus. You could use different names than the
# ones suggested below, but in that case make sure you keep coherence in properties names along the configuration file.

# one of them (this example shows how to configure 3 sink types at the same time). Even, you can define more than one
# sink of the same type and sharing the channel in order to improve the performance (this is like having

 Although I dont use OrionHDFSSink and OrionCKANSink, I didnt touch those configurations because I really am not sure weather I should. When I finally subscribeContext and target cygnus @ default port 5050, I get a normal response, but nothing is created in my database What am I doing wrong here?

@TITLE:How do I make a loading page while I am processing something in the backend with Django?
@CONTENT:I have a main view function for my application. After logging in successfully this main view method is called and is expected to render the template. But I have to perform some calculations in this view method [I am checking certain conditions about the user by making facebook graph api request.] Thus it takes 2~4 seconds to load. How do I show this loading scene since the template is rendered by return statement and thus is executed only when the process is complete. Should I make 2 views , one for showing loading and the other one for calculating and keep making AJAX request to other view method to check if the process is complete or not ?

}
 Note: It's working fine if the file is text file (test.txt) but not working for pdf (test.pdf) But here the text is not getting from PDF as it is, it's getting like byte code. How can I achieve this? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/29762551/group-claims-with-azure-ad-and-oauth2-implicit-grant-in-adal-js
@TITLE:Group claims with Azure AD and OAuth2 implicit grant in ADAL JS
@CONTENT:Background We are developing a multi-tenant SaaS product in Azure which has an AngularJS front-end and Web API back-end. We use Azure AD for authentication and have hooked it up with ADAL JS (using the OAuth2 implicit grant). Being a multi-tenant application, we allow customers to authenticate against their own Azure AD (which may or may not be connected to an on-premise AD). So far this all works nicely. ADAL JS takes the user to the Azure login page and once the user has authenticated, an OAuth2 token is issued. This JWT token is then sent with all API calls as a bearer token where we have our own claims transformation process for mapping the incoming claims from Azure to our application claims. Rather than specify individual users in the claims transformation process, we try to do it by AD groups. This allows our customers to have security groups in their AD and then our application will use that to map to the correct application claims. The problem The JWT token we receive does not contain a groups property, despite having set groupMembershipClaims to SecurityGroup in the AAD application manifest. I have since read in this tweet from Vittorio that The implicit grant will NOT send those claims, as it returns the token in the querystring - it's easy to blow past max length Upon further investigation, I also found this StackOverflow answer from Vittorio that says I verified and in the implicit grant case you will receive groups always via the overage claim. Please refer to https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-GroupClaims-DotNet/tree/master/WebApp-GroupClaims-DotNet - it will show you how to process the overage claim to retrieve groups. I had a look at the JWT token and it does not include any overage claim (identified by _claim_names and _claim_sources). I'm definitely a member of two groups in my Azure AD. I also now appear to have two conflicting statements about whether it is possible to get group information (whether directly or indirectly) in the implicit grant token. Question 1: Should I get an overage claim that I can use to get group information? If so, do I need to do anything to ensure that claim gets sent to me? Graph API Whether I can get an overage claim with a link to the user in the graph API or whether I have to manually craft the link to get the user's groups, I'm still a little unsure how I authenticate with the graph API. I need to contact the graph API from the back-end after receiving a request with a bearer token (from ADAL JS). Question 2: Can I send the same bearer token to the graph API to read that user's directory information? Or do I need to authenticate directly from my application to the graph API tenant in the context of the application rather than the user?

@TITLE:Is there an equivalent to the string function String(format: ¡K) using Swift formatting
@CONTENT:I'm starting to like the Swift string formatting since it uses variable names in the string rather than ambiguous formatting tags like "%@" I want to load a large string from a file that has Swift-style formatting in it (like this) Now is the time for all good \(who) to come to babble incoherently.
 Then I want to feed the contents of that String variable into a statement that lest me replace \(who)
 with the contents of the constant/variable who at runtime. The code below works with a string constant as the formatting string. let who = "programmers"
let aString = "Now is the time for all good \(who) to come to babble incoherently."
 That code does formatting of a quoted string that appears in-line in my code. Instead I want something like the code let formatString = "Now is the time for all good %@ to come to babble incoherently."
aString = String(format: formatString, who)
 But where I can pass in a Swift-style format string in a constant/variable I read from a file. Is that possible? I didn't have any luck searching for it since I wasn't exactly sure what search terms to use. I can always use C-style string formatting and the String class' initWithFormat method if I have to...

@CONTENT:can someone please guide me on how to build github projects using Jitpack. I tried to follow this instruction and always got an error. I forked a project and added some changes on it so I need to get the current commit id as version. To get a GitHub project into your build: Step 1. Add the JitPack maven repository to your build file

    url "https://jitpack.io"

Step 2. Add the dependency in the form:

    Group: com.github.Username
    Artifact: Repository Name
    Version: Release tag or commit id

That's it! The first time you request a project JitPack checks out the code, builds it and sends the Jar files back to you.
 Here is my gradle file buildscript {
    repositories {

@TITLE:Auto Layout proportionally Scaling Views
@CONTENT:I have already found several questions and answers about this topic but I simply cannot get this to work for me. The blue rectangle is a UIView which contains the Test Label and Gear image button. The red one is a second UIView. What I'd like to do is to get the blue bar (which is a UIView) increase in size for larger sized screens, which will result in the scaling of the Label and settings button, while the Red UIView shrink in height so the blue UIView can become larger. So basically the question is, how to proportionally scale the UIViews for different screen sizes. I have tried using aspect ratio constraints, height constraints (greater than/less than) but I just can't get the desired effect. Thanks.

 I want to create a summary table detailing the data for each activity bout (i.e. 1 - 3 in the table). My programming skills are limited so I would simply subset the data and populate a table. I would first convert the dates to ones R can read: bout$Date <- strptime(bout$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")
bout$Time <- strptime(bout$Time, "%H:%M:%S")
 NB - If anyone can help me get the 'Time' function working I should be most grateful - R is adding todays date. I then subset the data and use a few simple functions to calculate some summary data (i.e. date and time of first activity and its duration). bout.1 <- subset(bout, bout==1)
min.Date.1 <- min(bout.1$Date)
min.Time.1 <- min(bout.1$Time)
max.Time.1 <- max(bout.1$Time)
time.bout.1 <- difftime(max.Time.1, min.Time.1)
 ... I would then populate a summary table and repeat for the different bouts. How could I automate this to summary all the bouts in one function (there could be n number of bouts)? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Images seem to have been available via internet. i.e. It is not possible to set an image of a resource from my project. Furthermore I have some trouble understanding what Facebook is requiring. This is how Facebook displays my posting: And this is how my App seem to post the content So the question is: Where is my title and description gone??? Best regards Oliver

@LINK:/questions/29543803/are-single-lettered-word-models-supported-in-emberjs
@TITLE:Are single-lettered word models supported in EmberJS?
@CONTENT:I cannot really pinpoint whether the issue is with Ember or Ember data, or if it's even an issue, but here's what happens: Let's say you've got your model called tell_me_a_story. This will be the name that your JSON should provide, should you be using ActiveModelAdapter. Regardless, when Ember or Ember Data process it internally, it'll camelize it and it becomes tellMeAStory, correctly indicating that "A" and "Story" are two separate words. However, when internally it is decamelized to lookup for the model, the decamelize function will convert it into tell_me_astory. This final behavior seems flawed to me, but when looking at the tests that derived this behavior, it is actually intended to manage acronyms in that fashion. (Compare the following example with the "innerHtml" that I would expect for camel casing multi-letter acronyms.) QUnit.test("converts a camelized string into all lower case separated by underscores.", function() {
  deepEqual(decamelize('innerHTML'), 'inner_html');
  if (Ember.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES) {
    deepEqual('innerHTML'.decamelize(), 'inner_html');
  }
});
 (Source in Ember Runtime) So, which is the correct way to use single-letter words in models with Ember? Are they even supported? Here's an example of what I'm trying to do: // this comes from a separate data source, e.g. REST APIs
var myModelName = 'tell_me_a_story';
// this line will throw if the model file is named "tell-me-a-story"
if (!store.getById(myModelName, 1)) {
  // this line will throw if the model file is named "tell-me-astory"
  store.pushPayload(myModelName, myObject);
}
@CODE:tell_me_a_story tellMeAStory tell_me_astory QUnit.test("converts a camelized string into all lower case separated by underscores.", function() {
  deepEqual(decamelize('innerHTML'), 'inner_html');
  if (Ember.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES) {
    deepEqual('innerHTML'.decamelize(), 'inner_html');
  }
}); // this comes from a separate data source, e.g. REST APIs
var myModelName = 'tell_me_a_story';
// this line will throw if the model file is named "tell-me-a-story"
if (!store.getById(myModelName, 1)) {

 If I remove the delete statement everything works and it's the same with my real anonymous block. I want to point out that I'm the only one using the db so I don't think the table is locked by another user/process. Has anyone experienced that problem?

@LINK:/questions/29477298/setup-py-run-build-ext-before-anything-else
@TITLE:setup.py: run build_ext before anything else
@CONTENT:I'm working with a setup.py that creates a whole bunch of SWIG interface files during the build_ext step. This needs to run first, because subsequent build steps need a full list of the python files to work properly (like copying the python files to the package directory, creating the egg, creating the sources list, etc.). This is what currently happens when you do setup.py install: running install
running bdist_egg
running egg_info
running install_lib
running build_py
running build_ext
 The build_py step tries to copy all the python files that it finds to the build directory. Those files don't exist until build_ext runs (swig creates a bunch of .py files). This answer recommends changing sub_commands but that didn't appear to do anything. I tried just subclassing the install command class like this to run build_ext before anything else: class Build_ext_first(setuptools.command.install.install):
    def run(self):
        self.run_command("build_ext")
        super(Build_ext_first, self).run()
 ..and then working it in to setup with cmdclass: setup(
    ...
    cmdclass = {'install' : Build_ext_first}
)
 But that didn't work because super doesn't work with old-style classes and install apparently doesn't inherit from object. How do I do build_ext first?

@TITLE:Make HTML body background image transparent
@CONTENT:I am trying to make my background image transparent, and the rest of the page not transparent, eg a faded background image on top of non faded HTML and CSS. I have an HTML page with an image as the background using a div. Below is a simplified version of the page: <HTML>

<head>

    <style type="text/css">
        #backgroundImage {
            background-image: url('../Documents/images/Sea.jpg');
            background-repeat: no-repeat;

            width:100%;

<body>

<div id="backgroundImage">

    <div class="main">

    </div>

</div>

</body>
 I found this setup in the following question: How can I make my website's background transparent without making the content (images & text) transparent too? and it almost works, except that the whole page is transparent, not just the background image. I have tried adjusting the Z-index and opacity on the 'main' div, but it is not working. I feel this is a simple fix but I just cant see the solution. I also tried this question, but it did not seem to offer a solution: How do i make my background image transparent in CSS if I have the following code? and this one: CSS background-image-opacity? I do not have sufficient reputation to post an image of what I am trying to achieve.

@LINK:/questions/29442977/volley-jsonobjectrequest-post-parameters-no-longer-work
@TITLE:Volley JsonObjectRequest Post parameters no longer work
@CONTENT:I am trying to send POST parameters in a Volley JsonObjectRequest. Initially, it was working for me by following what the official code says to do of passing a JSONObject containing the parameters in the constructor of the JsonObjectRequest. Then all of a sudden it stopped working and I haven't made any changes to the code that was previously working. The server no longer recognizes that any POST parameters are being sent. Here is my code: RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);
String url ="http://myserveraddress";

// POST parameters
Map<String, String> params = new HashMap<String, String>();
params.put("tag", "test");

JSONObject jsonObj = new JSONObject(params);

// Request a json response from the provided URL
JsonObjectRequest jsonObjRequest = new JsonObjectRequest
        (Request.Method.POST, url, jsonObj, new Response.Listener<JSONObject>()
        {
            @Override
            public void onResponse(JSONObject response)
            {
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), response.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        },
        new Response.ErrorListener()
        {
            @Override
            public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error)
            {
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), error.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });

// Add the request to the RequestQueue.
queue.add(jsonObjRequest);
 Here is the simple tester PHP code on the server: $response = array("tag" => $_POST["tag"]);
echo json_encode($response);
 The response I get is {"tag":null} Yesterday, it worked fine and was responding with {"tag":"test"} I haven't changed a single thing, but today it is no longer working. In the Volley source code constructor javadoc it says that you can pass a JSONObject in the constructor to send post parameters at "@param jsonRequest": https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/+/master/src/main/java/com/android/volley/toolbox/JsonObjectRequest.java /** ?* Creates a new request. ?* @param method the HTTP method to use ?* @param url URL to fetch the JSON from ?* @param jsonRequest A {@link JSONObject} to post with the request. Null is allowed and ?*???????indicates no parameters will be posted along with request. I have read other posts with similar questions, but the solutions haven't worked for me: Volley JsonObjectRequest Post request not working Volley Post JsonObjectRequest ignoring parameters while using getHeader and getParams Volley not sending a post request with parameters. I've tried setting the JSONObject in the JsonObjectRequest constructor to null, then overriding and setting the parameters in the "getParams()", "getBody()", and "getPostParams()" methods, but none of those overrides has worked for me. Another suggestion was to use an additional helper class that basically creates a custom request, but that fix is a bit too complex for my needs. If it comes down to it I will do anything to make it work, but I am hoping that there is a simple reason as to why my code was working, and then just stopped, and also a simple solution.
@CODE:RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);
String url ="http://myserveraddress";

// POST parameters
Map<String, String> params = new HashMap<String, String>();
params.put("tag", "test");

JSONObject jsonObj = new JSONObject(params);

// Request a json response from the provided URL
JsonObjectRequest jsonObjRequest = new JsonObjectRequest
        (Request.Method.POST, url, jsonObj, new Response.Listener<JSONObject>()
        {
            @Override
            public void onResponse(JSONObject response)
            {
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), response.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        },
        new Response.ErrorListener()
        {
            @Override
            public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error)
            {
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), error.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });

// Add the request to the RequestQueue.
queue.add(jsonObjRequest); $response = array("tag" => $_POST["tag"]);
echo json_encode($response); {"tag":null} {"tag":"test"}

@LINK:/questions/29421414/why-does-array-diff-uassoc-compares-keys-whose-value-do-not-match
@TITLE:Why does array_diff_uassoc compares keys whose value do not match
@CONTENT:I just read that question about strange php behaviour, and even though I could research a bit more, I'm nowhere near understanding it. I assume the reader has read the original question and is aware of OP's code block and sample, but in short, OP is trying to compare those two arrays, and while the result is good, the compare function seems to be called erratically: $chomik = new chomik('a');
$a = array(5, $chomik, $chomik, $chomik);
$b = array($chomik, 'b', 'c', 'd');
array_diff_uassoc($a, $b, 'compare');
 The documentation is a bit obscure... but it does state that: The comparison function must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the second. As I understand it, that means that the compare() function should be more like this: function compare($a, $b) {
    echo("$a : $b<br/>");
    if($a === $b) return 0;
    else if ($a > $b) return 1;
    else return -1;
}
 however this still gives very strange results, with even more "duplicates" 
1 : 0
1 : 2
3 : 1
2 : 1
3 : 2
1 : 0
1 : 2
3 : 1
2 : 1
3 : 2
0 : 0
1 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 0
2 : 1
2 : 2
3 : 0
3 : 1
3 : 2
3 : 3
 faced with many doubts, I read the compat php function, and the part where the check actually happens is interesting: foreach ($args[0] as $k => $v) {
    for ($i = 1; $i < $array_count; $i++) {
        foreach ($args[$i] as $kk => $vv) {
            if ($v == $vv) { // compare keys only if value are the same
                $compare = call_user_func_array($compare_func, array($k, $kk));
                if ($compare == 0) {
                    continue 3; // value should not be added to the result
                }
            }
        }
    }
    $result[$k] = $v;
}
 here's the actual source (per comment) The way this code executes the compare function should not be outputting the result we see. Foreach is not able to move back and forth in the keys (AFAIK???), as seems to be the case in the order of the first key here: 
1 : 2
3 : 1
2 : 1
 moreover, it shouldn't check the keys if the value do not match, so why do all these are checked: 
1 : 2
3 : 1
2 : 1
3 : 2
etc...
 How can the topmost foreach() in the source code loop back and forth through the keys?! Why are keys whose values do not match still compared? Do foreach loops actually continue executing even when they've been continued? Is this an example of concurrency? can call_user_func_array somehow be launched and actually execute the echo("$a : $b<br/>"); of the compare function not in the same order they were "launched"??
@CODE:$chomik = new chomik('a');
$a = array(5, $chomik, $chomik, $chomik);
$b = array($chomik, 'b', 'c', 'd');
array_diff_uassoc($a, $b, 'compare'); compare() function compare($a, $b) {
    echo("$a : $b<br/>");
    if($a === $b) return 0;
    else if ($a > $b) return 1;
    else return -1;
} foreach ($args[0] as $k => $v) {
    for ($i = 1; $i < $array_count; $i++) {
        foreach ($args[$i] as $kk => $vv) {
            if ($v == $vv) { // compare keys only if value are the same
                $compare = call_user_func_array($compare_func, array($k, $kk));
                if ($compare == 0) {
                    continue 3; // value should not be added to the result
                }
            }
        }
    }
    $result[$k] = $v;
} continue echo("$a : $b<br/>");

@CONTENT:What exactly does MPI_IN_PLACE do when given as an argument to MPI_Scatter and how should it be used? I can't make sense of man MPI_Scatter: When the communicator is an intracommunicator, you can perform a gather operation in-place (the output buffer is used as the input buffer). Use the variable MPI_IN_PLACE as the value of the root process recvbuf. In this case, recvcount and recvtype are ignored, and the root process sends no data to itself. Because the in-place option converts the receive buffer into a send-and-receive buffer, a Fortran binding that includes INTENT must mark these as INOUT, not OUT. What I want to do is use the same buffer that contains the data on the root as the receive buffer at each other process (like in MPI_Bcast). Will MPI_Scatter with MPI_IN_PLACE let me do this?

@TITLE:Docker Weave and WeaveDNS issues
@CONTENT:I'm having an issue with setting up weaveDNS on a small weave network that I have running on my local machine. For now the problem manifests itself in the fact that when I run 'weave status' I'm not seeing a DNS section in the output (as its suggested in the Troubleshooting section of http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/weavedns.html). I'm running 4 containers. weave ps output is: c1d106ed5717 c2:ce:53:49:98:f6 10.0.1.12/24

 The highlighted container (10.0.1.200) is the weaveDNS container. The final container (2847dd89e90d) is the Weave router container. I'm starting containers with: sudo weave run --with-dns 10.0.1.30/24 -h service.weave.local --name service service_img_name 
 Does anyone have an idea why weave status is not showing a DNS section? If you need me to give you additional info on the Weave setup, please let me know.

@TITLE:Cannot return string from value of element in protractor test
@CONTENT:So I'm trying to get a string value to be returned from the value of an element on the resolution of this promise. I want to pass a raw string value to another function that I'm building inside a protractor test. This is the element: <div style='hidden' >
    <input id="group-sendgrid-hidden-input" ng-model='groupCode' value='dangyo' >
</div>
 I'm looking for a way to get at either the model value or the attribute value (either will work). Model value might even be better. This is my attempt to resolve the a promise here and return a result: // first get the element driver object
var groupCode = element(by.id('group-sendgrid-hidden-input'));

// next resolve a promise provided by this element
groupCode.getAttribute('value').then(function(value){

    console.log( 'should be a string: ' + value);

    return value;
});
 Here the console.log( 'should be a string: ' + value); always returns null for the value and nothing I can do seems to resolve this. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong because I am new to protractor and this seems simple. Does anyone else experience this behavior?
@CODE:<div style='hidden' >
    <input id="group-sendgrid-hidden-input" ng-model='groupCode' value='dangyo' >
</div> // first get the element driver object
var groupCode = element(by.id('group-sendgrid-hidden-input'));

// next resolve a promise provided by this element
groupCode.getAttribute('value').then(function(value){

@CONTENT:I have a panel inside another: The inner panel is aligned alTop: And the outer panel is set to AutoSize=true: And everything sizes. If i changes the height of the inner panel at design time, the outer panel auto sizes to accommodate it: And now runtime Now i need to change the height of the inner panel at runtime: procedure TForm2.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);

 Except when i change the height of the inner panel at runtime, the autosize panel does not autosize: This of course worked in Delphi 5, 7, and probably XE2 - XE5. What's the fix? The workaround is, of course, to bypass Alignment/Autosize and do everything during various OnResize events. But that's distinctly not RAD. I'm sure it's a small bug in the VCL somewhere. And since we already have about two-dozen XE6 VCL bugs that we've patched, it would be better to fix it so nobody else has to think about it. Bonus Chatter I love the line: and, could you please attach sample project? It's almost as if nobody bothered to even try to reproduce it.

@TITLE:Customize templates for `sphinx-apidoc`
@CONTENT:I've recently tried using sphinx-apidoc from Sphinx to help generate Sphinx specific reStructuredText from the API of a Python project. However, the result I'm getting is: Anyone know if I can customize the template sphinx-api uses for its output? Specifically, I'd like to: Get rid of all the "Submodules", "Subpackages" and "Module contents" headings, and Have the results from docstring in my __init__.py files appear directly under the packages, so that if I click a package name, the first thing I see is the package documentation. At the moment, this documentation is placed under the slightly weird "Module contents" heading at the very end of each package section. The "Submodules" and "Subpackages" headings are redundant I think, since the normal headings for packages/modules is "xxx.yyy package" and "xxx.yyy.zzz module". The structure I would like for the above small example is orexplore.components package orexplore.components.mbg120 module orexplore.simulators package orexplore.simulators.test package orexplore.simulators.test.mbg120 module orexplore.simulators.mbg120 module Where clicking the packages, the first thing I'd see on the page would be the package documentation. Or maybe even just orexplore.components orexplore.components.mbg120 orexplore.simulators orexplore.simulators.test orexplore.simulators.test.mbg120 orexplore.simulators.mbg120 if there was some way to visually distinguish packages/modules (color? emblem?) instead of the quite wordy " package" and " module".

@CONTENT:I'm in the process of learning ASP.net, specifically WebAPI and MVC. I'm using Visual Studio Community 2013, .NET 4.5, and C#. I'm a total newb so I'm actually going through this particular walkthrough to understand how things work: http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api It's been ok so far, but I want to move on to connecting a database to populate my dataset. I'm very familiar with using Firebird and was able to install Firebird as a dataprovider (through NuGet and installing the appropriate DDEX files). Unfortunately, I'm having difficulty understanding how to query the database and populate my array. Basically, this is what my code looks like: using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

        {

            new User { ID = 2, CREATED=new DateTime(2012, 2, 22), ISACTIVE='Y', USERNAME="TEST2"}

        }
    }
}
 Currently, if I visit http://localhost/api/user, I get my list of test users via JSON (which is what I want). What I'm hoping to understand is how to change the array that I set to come from my Firebird database (via an SQL query). I know how to get my query (select * from users), I have a valid connection (confirmed through visual studio) and I have seen some tutorials on how to use FBConnection. What I'm having difficulty with is actually using the data from the query and populate the objects in the array. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you could tell me the piece of code that I need to enter, or point me to the right tutorials, or if you think I should be using a specific technology or methodology, that would be great. What I'm trying really trying to accomplish/understand is how to create a Web service that responds with JSON and that is connected to a Firebird database. Thanks in advance for any help!

@TITLE:Laravel 5 - session doesn't work
@CONTENT:Here's config/session.php: return [
    'driver' => 'file',

 My storage/framework/sessions have 755 permissions. When I put these 2 line in my controller Session::set('aa', 'bb');
dd(Session::get('aa'));
 I receive expected "bb" output. But if I comment first line: // Session::set('aa', 'bb');
dd(Session::get('aa'));
 and refresh page, I still expecting "bb" but getting null. Also, storage/framework/sessions is empty. What should I do to make Session working?

@LINK:/questions/29334930/how-to-proxy-methods-on-the-prototype-using-objectproxy-in-ember-js
@TITLE:How to proxy methods on the prototype using ObjectProxy in ember.js?
@CONTENT:I've got a simple ObjectProxy that I'd like to make calling methods on easy(er). For example, the object I plan to "proxy" has a method named foo and bar - they will not be available directly causing me to do something like this. this.get("model").get("content").foo();
this.get("model").get("content").bar();
 Instead I'd much prefer if foo and bar acted like they were on the object this.get("model").foo();
this.get("model").bar();
 I can make this happen (long hand) by hard coding the foo and bar methods on the ObjectProxy itself - then pulling content and invoking the method manually w/ apply like so   return Ember.ObjectProxy.extend({
        content: function() {
            var filter_value = this.get("filter_value");
            return this.get("source").filterBy("id", filter_value).objectAt(0);
        }.property("source.[]"),
        foo: function() {
            var content = Ember.get(this, 'content');
            return content["foo"].apply(content, arguments);
        },
        bar: function() {
            var content = Ember.get(this, 'content');
            return content["bar"].apply(content, arguments);
        }
    }).create({
        filter_value: id,
        source: store.find(type)
    });
 If instead I wanted to proxy each "method" like this - how can I set the prototype in a way that won't hurt the tree that ember has built up already?
@CODE:this.get("model").get("content").foo();
this.get("model").get("content").bar(); this.get("model").foo();
this.get("model").bar(); return Ember.ObjectProxy.extend({
        content: function() {
            var filter_value = this.get("filter_value");
            return this.get("source").filterBy("id", filter_value).objectAt(0);
        }.property("source.[]"),
        foo: function() {
            var content = Ember.get(this, 'content');
            return content["foo"].apply(content, arguments);
        },
        bar: function() {
            var content = Ember.get(this, 'content');
            return content["bar"].apply(content, arguments);
        }
    }).create({

@TITLE:why should I delete feature branches when merged to master
@CONTENT:Most of the git workflows I've seen suggest to delete a branch after it's been merged into master. For example, this gitflow suggests the following: # Incorporating a finished feature on develop 
$ git checkout develop
Switched to branch 'develop'
$ git merge --no-ff myfeature
Updating ea1b82a..05e9557
(Summary of changes)
$ git branch -d myfeature
Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557).
$ git push origin develop
 Why should I delete the branch? I'm also curios what to do when later a bug is discovered that was introduced by the feature - should I create the branch with the same name again, fix bug there, merge into master and again delete the branch?

@TITLE:Intercepting AJAX requests on Chrome for iOS?
@CONTENT:I intercept AJAX requests in my site by altering the XMLHttpRequest.prototype open and send methods. This method worked without any troubles in all the browsers I tested. However, when it comes to Chrome for iOS (iPhone) the code has the weirdest bug: it's like it continuously fire the code I changed in the prototype (ending up crashing, obviously). Here's a super-minimal example of what I am doing: var open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open; // Caching the original
XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function(method, url, async, user, pass) {
    alert('open'); // Here is my code
    open.call(this, method, url, async, user, pass); // Calling the original
 };
 I've assembled a little JSBin doing just that you can visit with your Chrome on iOS: Demo According to this answer, the code I'm using (essentially the same as the one OP in that answer is going to use) is safe and there should be no reason to worry. And, as a matter of fact, Chrome for iOS is the only browser which behaves weirdly. This has been driving me nuts for two days, any suggestion or workaround appreciated.

I get the following error message when loading the web page: "This page was unable to display a Google Maps element. The provided Google API key is invalid or this site is not authorized to use it.

@LINK:/questions/29269124/convenient-way-to-define-all-comparison-operators-for-class-with-one-numeric-dat
@TITLE:Convenient way to define all comparison operators for class with one numeric data member?
@CONTENT:If I have a type that consists of a single numeric data member (say, an int) and various methods, is there a convenient way to tell the compiler to automatically generate all the obvious comparison operators? I.e., instead of this (using inline instead of constexpr for C++03, of course): class MyValueType
{
    private:
        int myvalue;
    public:
        constexpr bool operator<(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue < rhs.myvalue; }
        constexpr bool operator>(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue > rhs.myvalue; }
        constexpr bool operator>=(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue >= rhs.myvalue; }
        constexpr bool operator==(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue == rhs.myvalue; }
        /// .... etc
}
 I want something like Ruby's Comparable mixin, which basically allows you to define one operator and let Ruby take care of the rest. And I'd even assume that the compiler-generated versions would probably be better than mine: should rhs be a const ref for each case? Should I define versions that take forwarding references? What if I forget one of the operators? Etc. So...does something like this exist? (Please forgive me if this is a duplicate; I assumed someone would have already asked this somewhere, because it seems like an obvious feature to want, but I can't find any.) EDIT: Automatic generation of comparison operators has been proposed as a feature: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3950.html
@CODE:int inline constexpr class MyValueType
{
    private:
        int myvalue;
    public:
        constexpr bool operator<(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue < rhs.myvalue; }
        constexpr bool operator>(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue > rhs.myvalue; }
        constexpr bool operator>=(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue >= rhs.myvalue; }
        constexpr bool operator==(MyValueType rhs) const { return myvalue == rhs.myvalue; }
        /// .... etc
} rhs const #define constexpr #define #define MyType int inline #define

@TITLE:UITableViewCells initial load view/display issue
@CONTENT:So I've got a UITableView loading up many columns of quotes. Upon entering the UITableView that displays this data, the cells seem to initially not be loading properly and the text looks really squished and/or cut off, after about a 1/2 second, it loads properly and everything works fine. This occurs every time I load up the table view. For example: Is this a problem with the .estimatedrowheight...or is it because the view cannot load the data into theUITableView` fast enough? I've tried modifying the row height to no avail however. Edit It looks like when I explicity set the height like this - captionsTableView.rowHeight = 80 it works just fine...as in the cells load at 80points in height each, without the initial loading glitch. But using captionsTableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension and captionsTableView.estimatedRowHeight = 80.0 breaks it Edit 2 - code class CaptionsController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource  {

@TITLE:Server mode GC seems to never collect Gen 0 Heap
@CONTENT:Clarified question (tl;dr) After reading and profiling with all the results covered below, the problem seems to boil down to the GC not collecting Gen 0 Heap for our applications when in Server mode, as soon as its changed to Workstation mode the problem goes away. Original question and details My question is somewhat related to:This question and this question. We recently ran into what seemed to be a memory leak in our .NET applications on our test environments, the worker processes would climb to around 450MB usage either quickly when under load or gradually when under no load. The problem could not be replicated on our development environments, the primary difference being that the dev environments are physical servers whereas the test environments are virtualized and controlled by Puppet (apart from that I do not have much knowledge of the environments themselves). In order to hopefully see what objects were responsible for taking up all that memory I ran Ants Memory Profiler on the test server, I found that all of that memory was remaining as unused and was never being released. While researching what could cause this I came across this forum post which in turn lead me to this article. I ended up trying the configuration it recommends, to put the GC into workstation mode: <configuration>
  <runtime>
    <gcServer enabled="false"/>
    <gcConcurrent enabled="false"/>
  </runtime>
</configuration>
 After running iisreset and re running my memory profiling the issue was completely gone, which is great but still doesn't really explain what was happening in the first place. I did do some more reading and found this SO question, which leads me to believe that this configuration change may end up being detrimental to the throughput of our applications. So my question is: What would cause an IIS worker process to accumulate a large amount of unused memory that never gets garbage collected? Edit: To clarify my question a bit more, I believe we have proven that the code is not responsible for this, as the exact same code does not experience this issue on the dev environment. Here are the screenshots I took of my memory profiling before and after the configuration change, there isn't a lot of information here but the graph does show the memory trend nicely. Edit 2: Here are the server specs from what I could gather, I can possibly get more will just take time. Dev Environment: Physical Machine CPU: Single core Memory: 6GB Test Environment: Virtual Machine CPU: 4 Logical threads (I cannot comment on CPU count) Memory: 8GB The only difference in the Machine.Config files is that the dev environment is adding "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagnostics.ServiceModelSink.Behavior" to both endpoint and service behaviours. And the test environment currently has the GC settings previously mentioned in the aspnet.config file. Edit 3: Did some more profiling and noticed a couple more counters that I could add within Ants, notably I added "Gen 0 heap size" and it looks like this is the source of the issues. With the GC in server mode when I trigger the test I'm using for profiling this line immediately jumps up to ~300MB then comes back down to ~230MB but never goes all the way back down (graph below). Running the same profiling with the GC in workstation mode sees the Gen 0 heap size have a much smaller initial spike and return back to essentially zero when the requests have finished (graph below). Doing some more searching on this lead me to another much more related SO question, however his findings were that this memory usage was a non issue, whereas in my case the service actually needs to be manually restarted at least once a day. I also found this article that had the following to say on the issue (which seems to describe what is happening almost perfectly: Generation 0 is likely to have a larger number of objects on a 64-bit system, especially when you use server garbage collection instead of workstation garbage collection. This is because the threshold to trigger a generation 0 garbage collection is higher in these environments, and generation 0 collections can get much bigger. Performance is improved when an application allocates more memory before a garbage collection is triggered. Though the problem still remains that in Server mode the Generation 0 heap is seemingly never collected as opposed to just not as often.

@TITLE:C - Memory map a B-Tree
@CONTENT:I'm trying to memory map a huge file (approx. 100GB) in order to store a B-Tree with billions of key-value pairs.

 The problem is that I receive Cannot allocate memory (errno is 12) if the requested size is bigger than the actual memory or a Segmentation fault if the requested space is outside of the mapped region. I was told that it is possible to map files bigger than the actual memory. Will the system manage the file by itself or am I responsible for mapping only the amount of free memory and when accessing further space I have to unmap and map to another offset.

@CONTENT:I have a data.table in this fashion: dd <- data.table(f = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b"), g = c(1,2,3,4,5))
dd
 I need to sum the values g by factor f, and finally return a single row data.table object that has the maximum value of g, but that also contains the factor information. i.e. ___f|g   
1: b 9
 My closest attempt so far is tmp3 <- dd[, sum(g), by = f][, max(V1)]
tmp3
 Which results in: > tmp3
[1] 9
 EDIT: I'm ideally looking for a purely data.table piece of code/workflow. I'm surprised that with all the speedy fast split-apply-combine wizardry and ability to subset your data in the form of 'example[i= subset, ]` that I haven't found a straight forward way to subset on a single value condition.
@CODE:dd <- data.table(f = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b"), g = c(1,2,3,4,5))

@TITLE:Using ldply with unequal lengths from strsplit
@CONTENT:I am trying to split a data frame column into multiple columns based on some delimiters. I have found various answers on this site, and I'm trying to get different ways to work. I'm having trouble with ldply. The problem is that the output of strsplit is a list of elements of different lengths. Here is some sample data, what has worked, and what I'm attempting with ldply. FirstName <- c("a,b", "c d", "e, f", "gh")
OtherInfo <- c(1:4)
df <- data.frame(FirstName, OtherInfo, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Feels like a hack, and I have "gh" repeated
#Question: Is there a better way using a similar approach?

@CONTENT:I have a Hotels table in my database, and one of the columns is :status (integer). I'm looking to convert these integers into strings, so 1 = "Awaiting Contract", 2 = "Designing" and so on... I have searched Stack for some answers, and the lack of them makes me think that I'm coming at this problem from the wrong angle? I used to do this in PHP whilst pulling the data. New-ish to Rails so any help, or best practise advice would be much appreciated.

@TITLE:Coq case analysis and rewrite with function returning subset types
@CONTENT:I was working is this simple exercise about writing certified function using subset types. The idea is to first write a predecessor function pred : forall  (n : {n : nat | n > 0}), {m : nat | S m = n.1}.
 and then using this definition give a funtion pred2 : forall (n : {n : nat | n > 1}), {m : nat | S (S m) = n.1}.
 I have no problem with the first one. Here is my code Program Definition pred (n : {n : nat | n > 0}) : {m : nat | S m = n.1} :=
  match n with
  | O => _
  | S n' => n'
  end.
Next Obligation. elimtype False. compute in H. inversion H. Qed.
 But I cannot workout the second definition. I trying to write these definition Program Definition pred2 (n : {n : nat | n > 1}) : {m : nat | S (S m) = n.1} 
:= pred (pred n).
 I managed to prove the two first obligations Next Obligation. apply (gt_trans n 1 0). assumption. auto. Qed.
Next Obligation. 
  destruct pred.  
  simpl.
  simpl in e. 
  rewrite <- e in H.
  apply gt_S_n in H; assumption.
Qed.
 But for the last obligation I get stuck because when I try to do a case analysis for the return type of pred the new hypotesis are not rewrited in the goal. I tried the following tactics with no results. destruct (pred (n: pred2_obligation_1 (n ; H))).

destruct (pred (n; pred2_obligation_1 (n ; H))) eqn:?.
rewrite Heqs.
 I know that I can with write pred2 directly, but the idea is to use and compose the function pred.
@CODE:pred : forall  (n : {n : nat | n > 0}), {m : nat | S m = n.1}. pred2 : forall (n : {n : nat | n > 1}), {m : nat | S (S m) = n.1}. Program Definition pred (n : {n : nat | n > 0}) : {m : nat | S m = n.1} :=

@TITLE:How can I use an SVG image as a map marker in OpenLayers-3?
@CONTENT:I am trying to create map "pin-drops" (ie. map markers) in OpenLayers-3 (OL3) using SVG images. Currently, I am using PNG images as the pindrops that reference the ol.style.Icon source (¡§src¡¨) property attribute just fine. However, this fails using an SVG image. Is there some other way to use an SVG in the same manner? Maybe by using a reference besides ol.style.Icon even? There is already a lot of built-in SVG in Open Layers so this should be possible, but I haven't found a way to get this working in OL3. Is there some other way to do this in OL3 that I should consider? Please note: we already tried using an ol.Vector layer, however when the user zooms in/out, the size of the SVG image grows/shrinks which is an inadequate workaround. OL3 (fails): var createMapMarkerImage = function() {
    return function(feature, resolution) {
        var iconStyle = new ol.style.Style({
            image: new ol.style.Icon( ({
                src: 'img/map_pindrop.svg'   // OL3 doesn¡¦t like this, but accepts a .PNG just fine
            }))
        });
        return [iconStyle];
    };
};
 Very similar functionality, is the below example I found online, is almost perfect if it weren¡¦t for the fact that the example uses OpenLayers-2 (OL2) functionality which calls openlayers.js library (instead of OL3¡¦s ol.js library). Sadly, swapping these javascript files out fails. OL2 (works -but is the old OL library): http://dev.openlayers.org/sandbox/camptocamp/tipi/examples/vector-symbols.html Searching online for a solution to this seems to produce only other confused people searching for a solution. Please help, FreeBeer

@TITLE:iOS FacebookSDK + Parse SDK + GoogleMaps SDK
@CONTENT:I searched a lot and I realized, -ObjC flag that GoogleMapSDK requires, doesn't play well with ParseSDK and FacebookSDK. So I read on all the stackoverflow answers and tried solving my problem. The problem isn't fixed yet. Steps I performed: Problem 1:Parse doesn't work with -ObjC Solution 1: To make Parse work with -ObjC import the FacebookSDK. Done Problem 2: Parse and Fb SDK both use Bolts.framework and the linker gives duplicate symbol errors(some 92 of them) Solution 2: Delete Bolts.framework as FacebookSDK already is pre-bundled with it. Problem 3: After removing the Bolts.framework , duplicate errors go away but there is this one tiny linker error that I can't figure out. I'm assuming they've changed something in the new SDK version. The error is as follows: Solution: ?? Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64: "_BFTaskMultipleExceptionsException", referenced from: ___53+[PFObject(Private) deleteAllAsync:withSessionToken:]_block_invoke214 in Parse(PFObject.o) ___65+[PFObject(Private) _deepSaveAsync:withCurrentUser:sessionToken:]_block_invoke311 in Parse(PFObject.o) ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) The same problem was asked in the comments of [this answer on SO][1] without any reply or a constructive answer. P.S. One thing I noticed that FacebookSDK comes bundled with Bolts version 1.1.3 and Parse has a version 1.1.4 in its zip file. Is this causing the problem?? P.P.S. I'm using the latest verions of SDK as of today's date(19th March, 2015) They are: - Parse SDK: 1.6.4 - GoogleMaps SDK: 1.9.2

@TITLE:Dynamic attribute in ReactJS
@CONTENT:I want to dynamically include/omit the disabled attribute on a button element. I have seen plenty of examples of dynamic attribute values, but not of attributes themselves. I have the following render function: render: function() {
    var maybeDisabled = AppStore.cartIsEmpty() ? "disabled" : "";
    return <button {maybeDisabled}>Clear cart</button>
}
 This throws a parse error because of the "{" character. How can I include/omit the disabled attribute based on the (boolean) result of AppStore.cartIsEmpty()?
@CODE:render: function() {
    var maybeDisabled = AppStore.cartIsEmpty() ? "disabled" : "";

I've checked the other build directories (Debug-iphonesimulator and Release-iphoneos), and neither of those directories contain the file either.

@TITLE:Set min date to current date in angularJS input
@CONTENT:In AngularJS, how can we set the min attribute of input type="date" to current date (today's) ? <input type="date" ng-model="data.StartDate" name="StartDate" min=?? />
 Edit1 I did what was suggested below and added this in controller - $scope.currentDate = new Date();
 And this in Html - <input type="date" ng-model="data.StartDate" name="StartDate" required min="{{currentDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd'}}" />
<span ng-show="form.StartDate.$dirty && form.StartDate.$invalid">
    <span ng-show="form.StartDate.$error.required">Start Date is required</span>
    <span ng-show="form.StartDate.$error.min">Start Date should not be less than current date</span>
</span>
 Now, only the year is not allowing to be selected less than 2015. Also, if whole date is less than current date, then no validation is occuring. Required validation is working fine. Is .min correct way to check the field? Thanks
@CODE:min input type="date" <input type="date" ng-model="data.StartDate" name="StartDate" min=?? /> $scope.currentDate = new Date(); <input type="date" ng-model="data.StartDate" name="StartDate" required min="{{currentDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd'}}" />

@TITLE:Facebook SDK and sharing a Play Store app link with ShareDialog issue
@CONTENT:I'm trying to share a link(my Google Play app link) using ShareDialog from Facebook SDK but the problem is that when the URL is my app's Google Play link the other information is not displayed correctly... Actually it's displaying only the link from Google Play without name or description! Here's the code: FacebookDialog shareDialog = new FacebookDialog.ShareDialogBuilder(
                    this)
                    .setLink("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<myapp>")

                    .build();
            uiHelper.trackPendingDialogCall(shareDialog.present());
 I tried everything and with other URL's actually is working(displaying name, description, caption etc.) but not with the app's URL. Does anyone know why a Google Play link won't work with text, description or caption?
@CODE:FacebookDialog shareDialog = new FacebookDialog.ShareDialogBuilder(
                    this)

    <body>
        @section('sidebar')
            This is the master sidebar.

        <div class="container">

</html>
 Since @yield can also pass in some default content using @yield('section', 'Default Content'), is @yield just a shorthand for a @section that do not uses @parent? @section
    <!-- Nothing here -->
@show
 What other differences are there?

@CONTENT:I wanted to log http request and response to Neo4j server. I searched and got the answer on stackoverflow itself in below question: How to log query statement to Neo4j server, is it possible? The configuration in the answer to above question results in same time logged for both request/response. I was wondering what that time represents ,i.e, when the server received the request or when it generated the response? Also, I want to log the request and response with individual time for each(i.e, request with time when server received it and response with time when it was generated)? I tried to add a separate pattern for response but it didn't work: <pattern>%h %l %user [%t{dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z}] "%r" %s %b "%i{Referer}" "%i{User-Agent}" \nRequest:\n%fullRequest</pattern>
<pattern>%h %l %user [%t{dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z}] "%r" %s %b "%i{Referer}" "%i{User-Agent}" \nResponse:\n%fullResponse</pattern> Any ideas to achieve it? Regards, Rahul

@TITLE:ReactJs: Wrap Semantic UI Modal using Portal ¡§pattern¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm trying to wrap Semantic UI Modal component using portal approach described here Here is my take at it http://jsfiddle.net/mike_123/2wvfjpy9/ I'm running into issue though, when obtaining a DOM reference and Rendering new markup into it there seem to be old reference still maintained. render: function() {
    return <div className="ui modal"/>; <-- the idea at first was to only return <div/>
},
 ...         React.render(<div > <----------- originally this element had className="ui modal", but this.node doesn't seem to overtake the original node reference
                    <i className="close icon"></i>
                    <div className="header">test</div>
                    <div className="content">

                </div>, <----------- 
                this.node);

@TITLE:How to disable RecyclerView item decoration drawing for the duration of item animations
@CONTENT:I have some basic item decoration which draws some stuff in ItemDecoration.onDrawOver method. This RecyclerView also has DefaultItemAnimator set on it. Animations are working, all is great. Except one thing. When all existing items are swapped with a new item set in this adapter, the decorations are being shown while animation is running. I need a way to hide them. When animation finishes, they need to be shown, but while it is running, they must be hidden. I tried the following: public void onDrawOver(..., RecyclerView.State state) {
    if(state.willRunPredictiveAnimations() || state.willRunSimpleAnimations()) {
        return;
    }
    // else do drawing stuff here
}
 but this isn't helping. Decoration is only removed for the short period of animation, but then appears again while it is still running. Also setup includes a RecyclerView.Adapter which hasStableIds() (in case that bit matters).
@CODE:ItemDecoration.onDrawOver RecyclerView DefaultItemAnimator public void onDrawOver(..., RecyclerView.State state) {
    if(state.willRunPredictiveAnimations() || state.willRunSimpleAnimations()) {
        return;

    // else do drawing stuff here
} RecyclerView.Adapter

I have checked this with the CKEditor demo to make sure it is not my code, and this problem happens there too. I have checked the demo in Internet Explorer 11, Opera 27.0 and Chrome 41 and the source code wraps in all of these browsers, so why is it not wrapping in Firefox? I am using Windows 8.1. Thanks.

@TITLE:Intercept serial port data in Delphi
@CONTENT:I know how to comunicate over serial port using TComPort, but I'd like to view the data going in and out a virtual (USB<=>RSR232) COM port without interupting the transmition and (obviously) opening the port. To be precise I want to see the GPS data from the USB GPS receiver. The thing is that I need to apps using the same data at the same time. My Delphi app and the navigation software. The alternative would be to have the decent PC navigation software with Europe maps (open street map would also be fine, but can't find any decent car navigation software) that has good API whci can return the GPS position. Any ideas are welcome! :) Thanks! G.

@TITLE:Painting custom background of parent and parent children in C#
@CONTENT:I am trying to use this tutorial so that I can have a transparent button. It works fine for the main background, but it doesn't draw over the other children. If I use BringToFront() it then doesn't have the other child's drawing where it should be. I have started to get around it by adding this to the code: foreach (Control child in Parent.Controls) {
    if(child != this) {
        InvokePaintBackground(child, pea);
        InvokePaint(child, pea);
    }
}
 And although I get some of what I want, it's in the wrong location (on the left instead of in the middle where it shoudl be) and the shapes which are drawn in the child's paint event also aren't showing up. How can I modify so that I will have all of the other children as well giving the full illusion of transparency? Note: I'm not worried about paining for anybody but other children, as I know that there aren't any, and there are pleny of other places to find out how to get all of the children recursively. Thanks to C.Evenhuis answer, its now working. My implementation is simple (only one other child), so this is my code. For future readers, be sure to read that post though to get a fll scope. using (PaintEventArgs pea = new PaintEventArgs(e.Graphics, rect)) {
    pea.Graphics.SetClip(rect);
    InvokePaintBackground(Parent, pea);
    InvokePaint(Parent, pea);
    foreach (Control child in Parent.Controls) {
        if (child != this) {
            pea.Graphics.ResetTransform();
            pea.Graphics.TranslateTransform(child.Left - Left, child.Top - Top);
            InvokePaintBackground(child, pea);
            InvokePaint(child, pea);
        }

@TITLE:Generating good training data for haar cascades
@CONTENT:I am trying to build haar cascades for doing OCR of a specific font; one classifier per character. I can generate tons of training data just by drawing the font onto images. So, the plan is to generate positive training data for each character, and use the examples of other characters as negative training data. I am wondering how much variation I should put into the training data. Normally I'd just try everything, but I gather these things take days to train (for each character!) so some advice would be good. So, a few questions: Does the training algorithm recognise that I don't care about transparent pixels? Or will it perform better if I superimpose the characters over different backgrounds? Should I include images where each character is shown with different prefixes and suffixes, or should I just treat each character individually? Should I include images where the character is scaled up and down? I gather the algorithm pretty much ignores size, and scales everything down for efficiency anyway? Thanks!

@TITLE:How to map elements of the list to their indices using Java 8 streams?
@CONTENT:Having a list of strings, I need to construct a list of objects which are effectively pairs (string, its position in the list). Currently I have such code using google collections: public Robots(List<String> names) {
    ImmutableList.Builder<Robot> builder = ImmutableList.builder();
    for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
        builder.add(new Robot(i, names.get(i)));
    }
    this.list = builder.build();
}
 I would like to do this using Java 8 streams. If there was no index, I could just do: public Robots(List<String> names) {
    this.list = names.stream()
            .map(Robot::new) // no index here
            .collect(collectingAndThen(
                    Collectors.toList(),
                    Collections::unmodifiableList
            ));
}
 To get the index, I would have to do something like this: public Robots(List<String> names) {
    AtomicInteger integer = new AtomicInteger(0);
    this.list = names.stream()
            .map(string -> new Robot(integer.getAndIncrement(), string))
            .collect(collectingAndThen(
                    Collectors.toList(),
                    Collections::unmodifiableList
            ));
}
 However, the documentation says that mapping function should be stateless, but the AtomicInteger is effectively its state. Is there a way to map elements of the sequential stream to their positions in the stream?
@CODE:(string, its position in the list) public Robots(List<String> names) {
    ImmutableList.Builder<Robot> builder = ImmutableList.builder();
    for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
        builder.add(new Robot(i, names.get(i)));
    }
    this.list = builder.build();
} public Robots(List<String> names) {
    this.list = names.stream()
            .map(Robot::new) // no index here
            .collect(collectingAndThen(
                    Collectors.toList(),

@CONTENT:Im testing Android In app purchase subscription with one of my accounts with TEST License access (I'm aware Test access won't support Subscriptions).

 No 'ORDERID' is found. Tried switching to another Wallet account but no luck. Any clue??

@TITLE:UITableView is jumpy/choppy/jerky when scrolling up
@CONTENT:I encountered this problem when using UITableView, the tableView's cells have different heights, and the auto layout constraints are set properly. When you scroll down to the bottom of tableView and load more data (no matter by using reloadData or insertRowsAtIndexPaths), and then scroll up, the tableView will start to be jumpy at some point, and then be jumpy all the time until you scroll to the very top. Not only for my own project, I find this project on github (link) have the same problem so that you can reproduce it.

@TITLE:BigQuery - same query works when submitted from UI and reports SQL syntax error from batch
@CONTENT:I have a SQL query involving two joins on different fields. When I run this query interactively in the UI, I get back a result set, no problem. When I submit the exact same query in batch, I get back a SQL syntax error: Ambiguous field name 'video' in JOIN. Please use the table qualifier before field name. But the joins are already fully qualified: SELECT

 Is someone from Google Big Query is seeing this, the project is rising-ocean-426, the batch job id is job_1YPDj1wNHPg82aZcvRKjD3coykg If I pull the query from this job and paste it into the UI, it works (after changing \n to returns).

While digging around i found that some people consider f(X):-a(X) to be a predicate and some consider jealous(X,Y):-loves(X,Z), loves(Y,Z) to be a structure (or a complex term). They look pretty much the same to me. Somebody care to explain?

@TITLE:Track eye balls using tracking.js
@CONTENT:I am working with a red eye remover effect with html5 canvas. I used tracking.js to track the eyes. Check the following code. Html <!-- Include tracking js libraries -->
<script src="js/tracking-min.js"></script>
<script src="js/eye-min.js"></script>

<img id="sourceImg" src="red_eye1.jpg"  width="202" height="187">
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="202" height="187" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;"></canvas>
 Javascript document.getElementById("sourceImg").onload = function() {
    var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
    var img = document.getElementById("sourceImg");
    ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);

    // track eyes
    var tracker = new tracking.ObjectTracker(['eye']);
    tracker.setStepSize(1.7);
    tracking.track('#sourceImg', tracker);
    tracker.on('track', function(event) {
        event.data.forEach(function(rect) {
            // rect consists area of each eyes.
            var imgData = ctx.getImageData(rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height);
            // remove red eye
            var i;
            for (i = 0; i < imgData.data.length; i += 4) {
                // find and check red intensity
                var redIntensity = (imgData.data[i] / ((imgData.data[i+1] + imgData.data[i+2]) / 2));
                if (redIntensity > 1.5)  // 1.5 because it gives the best results
                {
                    // reduce red to the average of blue and green
                    imgData.data[i] = (imgData.data[i+1] + imgData.data[i+2]) / 2;
                }
            }
            ctx.putImageData(imgData, rect.x, rect.y);

        });
    });  
};
 I got the following result. Here the red eye removed successfully. But it affected the color around the eye area. Because the tracking.js returned the eye area including the surrounding area. How to track the eye balls, which will solve this issue.

 so it seems the actor-client is found but three other dependencies not and it seems also not working to use both typesafe repos at once :( Any idea? Edit: I have investigated a bit, if I use these resolvers: resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

resolvers += Resolver.url("Typesafe Ivy", url("http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-snapshots"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
 It checks all repos properly: [warn]   module not found: com.typesafe.play#sbt-run-support_2.10;2.3.8
[warn] ==== typesafe-ivy-releases: tried

 But as soon as I add the normal typesafe repo as third: resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

resolvers += Resolver.url("Typesafe Ivy", url("http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-snapshots"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

resolvers += "Typesafe" at "http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"
 All resolvers will be ignored and it only checks from a typesafe repository with name "Typesafe Releases Repository" what is not configurated at all: [warn]   module not found: com.typesafe.sbtrc#actor-client-2-10;0.3.1

 I FOUND A WORKING SOLUTION FOR ME: Once you open the play app with activator there will be a new file at project/play-fork-run.sbt which contains this line: addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-fork-run-plugin" % "2.3.8")
 This sbt plugin depends on the actor jar which leads to not being able to deploy on Heroku. If I delete play-fork-run.sbt I can deploy the project on Heroku. It's only a temp solution since if you open the app with the activator the dependency will be added again, but at least it's possible to deploy the app.

@LINK:/questions/28932236/how-can-i-set-campaign-with-google-analytics-using-setcampaignparamsfromurl
@TITLE:How can I set campaign with Google Analytics using setCampaignParamsFromUrl()
@CONTENT:Update This was caused by a bug that Google have fixed in "Release Version 4.5 - Google Play Services 7.3 (May 1, 2015)". When using Google Play Services 7.3 or later it should be possible to call setCampaignParametersFromUrl() with a full URL as expected. Original question I'm using Google Analytics V4 in my Android app. On startup I send a screen view hit to Google Analytics and I set the campaign parameters on my HitBuilders.ScreenViewBuilder by calling setCampaignParamsFromUrl() like this: String url = "http://example.com/?referrer=utm_source%3Down-build%26utm_campaign%3Dinternal-testing";
builder.setCampaignParamsFromUrl(url); 
 It seems like this is working because I can see that the campaign is included in the logs from Google Analytics: V/GAV4¡R Thread[GAThread,5,main]: Sending hit to service ...,  cn=internal-testing...
 However when I'm looking at my data at the Google Analytics web interface the next day this campaign does not show up. I only have users with campaign "(not set)". I've uninstalled my app, cleared the advertising id and re-installed the app and I see this installation as a new user in the Google Analytics web interface so I know the data is sent there. But the campaign I use does not show up. Am I using setCampaignParamsFromUrl() wrongly or have I missed something else? Do I have to configure the campaigns I have somewhere or should Google Analytics pick up values it hasn't seen before as new campaigns automatically? (As for why I'm not listening to the install referrer event see: What is the scope of the utm_campaign dimension in Google Analytics v4 on Android?)
@CODE:setCampaignParametersFromUrl() setCampaignParamsFromUrl() String url = "http://example.com/?referrer=utm_source%3Down-build%26utm_campaign%3Dinternal-testing";

@TITLE:Does JSONB make PostgreSQL arrays useless?
@CONTENT:Suppose that you want to store "tags" on your object (say, a post). With release 9.4 you have 3 main choices: tags as text[] tags as jsonb tags as text (and you store a JSON string as text) In many cases, 3rd would be out of question since it wouldn't allow query conditional to 'tags' value. In my current development, I don't need such queries, tags are only there to be shown on posts list, not to filter posts. So, choice is mostly between text[] and jsonb. Both can be queried. What would you use? And why?

@CONTENT:Sometimes I get the error Win32Exception Not enough storage is available to process this command after the application has been running for around a month or so. This corresponds to the system error ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY (8)
 Usually, it's run as a Windows service, and changing the user it's logged on as still makes the error occur. However, if I run the application by double clicking on it, it works fine. The only way it can run as a Windows service again is if the server is restarted. The error appears in the logs that the application writes to.

@LINK:/questions/28916937/how-do-i-access-and-use-an-entity-using-core-data
@TITLE:How do I access and use an entity using Core Data
@CONTENT:It's time to use Core Data, but the open documentation and guides out there spend a lot of time talking about general setup and nitty gritty "behind the scenes" details. Those things are important, but I would love a quick, clean source showing how to actually use information stored in a Core Data model. The Scenario In my simple example I have a single entity type: Job
 - salary [Double]
 - dateCreated [Date]
 This is a Swift iOS app powered by story boards, with the default generated AppDelegate.swift which handles the generation of my Managed Object Context. The Question How do I use Job instances in my application? Bonus points if you can also provide insight around these items: As someone who is used to the MVC design pattern, how do I avoid including dirty data access inside of my controllers without bucking iOS development best practices? How can I access entities from Core Data while following DRY? How do I pass managed objects between methods and controllers while maintaining their type? The Core Data documentation provides some snippets for fetching records. This question is essentially asking where that logic belongs in an iOS application, and how to actually interact with the fetched records after fetching them. An Example This question isn't meant to be a broad, sweeping question so I will ground it in an example attempt to use Core Data. In my example I have a single UIViewController which has a label. I want this label to show the salary from a job. import UIKit
import CoreData

class JobViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet var salaryLabel: UILabel!
    let managedObjectContext = (UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate).managedObjectContext

    func updateLabel() {
        var job = getCurrentJob()
        salaryLabel.text = job.salary // ERRORS
    }

    func getCurrentJob()->(???) {
        var error: NSError?
        if let fetchedResults = managedObjectContext!.executeFetchRequest(NSFetchRequest(entityName:"Job"), error: &error) {
            return fetchedResults[0]
        }
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
    }
}
 This example will not compile for two reasons: I didn't specify a return type for getCurrentJob, since I wasn't sure what type to return The line with "ERRORS", which tries to access the salary attribute, will error because there is no way of knowing that salary is an actual attribute of job. How do I pass around and use the job object?
@CODE:Job
 - salary [Double]
 - dateCreated [Date] import UIKit
import CoreData

class JobViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet var salaryLabel: UILabel!
    let managedObjectContext = (UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate).managedObjectContext

    func updateLabel() {
        var job = getCurrentJob()
        salaryLabel.text = job.salary // ERRORS
    }

    func getCurrentJob()->(???) {
        var error: NSError?
        if let fetchedResults = managedObjectContext!.executeFetchRequest(NSFetchRequest(entityName:"Job"), error: &error) {
            return fetchedResults[0]
        }
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
    }
} salary UIViewController

@TITLE:modify perceptron to become gradient descent
@CONTENT:According to this video the substantive difference between the perceptron and gradient descent algorithms are quite minor. They specified it as essentially: Perceptron: £Gwi = £b(y - ?)xi Gradient Descent: £Gwi = £b(y - £\)xi I've implemented a working version of the perceptron algorithm, but I don't understand what sections I need to change to turn it into gradient descent. Below is the load-bearing portions of my perceptron code, I suppose that these are the components I need to modify. But where? What do I need to change? I don't understand. This is left for pedagogical reasons, I've sort of figured this out but am still confused about the gradient, please see UPDATE below       iteration = 0;
      do 
      {

              // difference between predicted and actual class values
              localError = outputs__train[p] - output;

          if (iteration < 10) 
              System.out.println("Iteration 0" + iteration + " : RMSE = " + Math.sqrt( globalError/number_of_files__train ) );

      } 
      while(globalError != 0 && iteration<=MAX_ITER);
 This is the crux of my perceptron:   static int calculateOutput( int theta, double weights[], double[][] feature_matrix, int file_index, int globo_dict_size )
  {
     //double sum = x * weights[0] + y * weights[1] + z * weights[2] + weights[3];
     double sum = 0;

     for (int i = 0; i < globo_dict_size; i++) 
     {
         sum += ( weights[i] * feature_matrix[file_index][i] );
     }
     //bias
     sum += weights[ globo_dict_size ];

     return (sum >= theta) ? 1 : 0;
  }
 Is it just that I replace that caculateOutput method with something like this: public static double [] gradientDescent(final double [] theta_in, final double alpha, final int num_iters, double[][] data ) 
{
    final double m = data.length;   
    double [] theta = theta_in;
    double theta0 = 0;
    double theta1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_iters; i++) 
    {                        
        final double sum0 = gradientDescentSumScalar0(theta, alpha, data );
        final double sum1 = gradientDescentSumScalar1(theta, alpha, data);                                   
        theta0 = theta[0] - ( (alpha / m) * sum0 ); 
        theta1 = theta[1] - ( (alpha / m) * sum1 );                        
        theta = new double [] { theta0, theta1 };
    }
    return theta;
}
 UPDATE EDIT At this point I think I'm very close. I understand how to calculate the hypothesis and I think I've done that correctly, but nevertheless, something remains terribly wrong with this code.

@TITLE:how is the most significant bit radix sort more efficient than the least significant bit radix sort?
@CONTENT:I was just reading the following question: Radix sort most significant first or least significant, which is faster? And the author of the accepted answer was suggesting that the MSD radix sort is indeed faster. I do not see why however. I have implemented both LSD and MSD (binary based by doing shift operations), LSD is iterative, requires just one bucket array, while MSD is recursive and requires one individual bucket array per every recursion call. If you create a random array of 10 million integers, I cannot see how MSD will be faster than LSD, since you will be allocating extra bucket arrays every time you re enter your function and also you will have to face the overhead of the recursion call themselves. I can see how the combination of MSD and LSD can give an over all boost (run MSD for the first few bits and LSD for the rest of the bits to reduce cache misses), but how is MSD alone expected to be more efficient than LSD given its recursive nature and the fact that you need a new bucket array for every recursion call, unlike LSD which is both iterative and just requires one bucket array for the entire sorting procedure?

@TITLE:Automapper returns reference to the same object when mapping sequences to arrays
@CONTENT:I have an extension method for IEnumerable<T>, which maps sequence items and returns an array of clones: public static class AutoMapperExtensions
{
    public static T[] MapToArray<T>(this IEnumerable<T> sequence)
    {
        return Mapper.Map<T[]>(sequence);
    }
}
 Here's code sample, whose behavior is weird from my point:         Mapper.CreateMap<SomeClass, SomeClass>();
        Mapper.AssertConfigurationIsValid();

        // clone list members and store them into array
        var list = new List<SomeClass>
        {
            new SomeClass { MyProperty = 1 },
            new SomeClass { MyProperty = 2 },
        };

        // works fine
        var array = list.MapToArray();

        // ...and ensure, that new array was created;
        // this fails, because Automapper returns reference to the same array
        Debug.Assert(array != newArray); 
 It seems to me, that last result is wrong. While I'm expecting, that mapper will create new array of clones, it just returns the reference to the same array. Is this documented elsewhere or this is a bug?

 The problem is that in $OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR folder on my openshift app there are only two log files: [myapp.rhcloud.com logs]\> ls
jbossews.log  postgresql.log
 In jbossews.log I see only that logging lines which relates to catalina.out if run application under local Tomcat 7. More specifically, in jbossews.log I see general error info, like: INFO: Deploying web application archive /var/lib/openshift/54...1d/app-root/runtime/dependencies/jbossews/webapps/myapp.war

 But I can not see details of my errors, which are usually printed on localhost.out under local Tomcat 7. So, how I can configure my gear or application to see full log? Thanks. UPD: This is not about log level, because parts of log which I've missed are with error level. Furthemore, I can see such things if I run my app under local tomcat.

@TITLE:Watchkit animation implementations: clock face, animated charts, circular progress bar
@CONTENT:I've seen some very basic demos of potential watchkit apps, and some appear to implement animations. Examples might be: A clock face with a moving second hand or even minute hand. A bar chart with bars that animate in, or who shape changes with new real-time data. A circular progress bar who's bar animates from zero to the current value. The only way I've seen so far to do animations is by a sequence of images over a duration: [imageView startAnimatingWithImagesInRange:NSMakeRange(0, 60) duration:1.0 repeatCount:0];
 How would these previous animation examples generally be implemented? I can't imagine they are all done with image sequences. I don't think one can even layer images, and coordinating placement would be a nightmare.

@TITLE:Can certain URLs be exempt from CSRF in sails.js?
@CONTENT:I'm setting up Stripe to work with my sails.js server, and in order to use Stripe's webhooks, I need to disable CSRF for the URLs I provide to Stripe. Is it possible to make certain URLs exempt from CSRF POST requirements in sails.js? The only configuration I can find for CSRF is to turn it on globally, and looking through the source code for the csrf hook (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/hooks/csrf/index.js) it looks like if I try to provide a custom object, it just gets replaced with the global settings anyway. Thanks

@LINK:/questions/28846443/in-laravel-5-how-do-i-implement-an-appbefore-filter
@TITLE:In Laravel 5 how do I implement an App::before() filter?
@CONTENT:In Laravel 4.2 I had this before filter that set the Eloquent model and table based on the URL (admin.example.com vs example.com) Here is my filter code: App::before(function($request)
{       
  // Check if we are using the admin URL
  $host = $request->getHost();
  $parts = explode('.', $host);
  if ($parts[0] == 'admin')
  {
    // Set the config for user info (not sponsor)
    Config::set('auth.model', 'Admin');
    Config::set('auth.table', 'admins');
  }
});
 I tried creating middleware for this in laravel 5 and have this code: class AdminOrSponsor implements Middleware {

  public function handle($request, Closure $next)
  {   
    $host = $request->getHost();
    $parts = explode('.', $host);
    if ($parts[0] == 'admin'){
        Config::set('auth.model', 'Admin');
        Config::set('auth.table', 'admins');
    }

    return $next($request);
  }

}
 In my routes.php file I am setting the controller that is called based on the auth.model setting like this: Route::get('/auth/login', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@getLogin');
Route::post('/auth/login', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@postLogin');
Route::get('/auth/logout', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@getLogout');
 What I found is that the routes are all read prior to the middleware so the change I am trying to make through Config::set() isn't happening. I am only getting the value that is set in the auth.php config file. What am I doing wrong and how should I do this in Laravel 5?
@CODE:App::before(function($request)
{       
  // Check if we are using the admin URL
  $host = $request->getHost();

  {
    // Set the config for user info (not sponsor)
    Config::set('auth.model', 'Admin');

  }
}); class AdminOrSponsor implements Middleware {

        Config::set('auth.table', 'admins');
    }

    return $next($request);
  }

} Route::get('/auth/login', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@getLogin');

@CONTENT:I am using Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 to create an Apache Cordova project. When I am debugging on the device (Android Nexus 6) my breakpoints are not in the correct file. I have TypeScript bundling to a single file and it has a .map file that appears to have the correct TypeScript files listed in it. What do I need to do to get the breakpoints in a Cordova project to work correctly with TypeScript? This is an angular project and it likes to break in my main app.ts file instead of the service.ts file I added the breakpoint to, but the watches all work correctly, its really hard to step through and see where you are.

@TITLE:CKEditor New Instance always unloaded
@CONTENT:I'm using CKEditor in my Angular app and have a view that reloads my CKEditor instance every time users access a new model. I'm using the following JS to initialize the editor: var initEditor = function() {
  $('.js-editor-wrap').html("<textarea id='editor'></textarea>");

  var editor = CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {});

  editor.on('loaded', function() {
    console.log('editor loaded');
  });

  editor.on('instanceReady', function() {
    console.log('instance ready')
  });
}
 And the following to destroy the editor: var destroyEditor = function() {
  if (CKEDITOR.instances['editor']) {
    CKEDITOR.instances['editor'].destroy(true);
    $('#editor').off().remove();
  }
}
 The first editor initialization works just as expected, but subsequent initializations create an editor instance with a status of "unloaded" that never triggers the "loaded" or "instanceReady" events. I'm not seeing any errors in the console. Any ideas what might be causing this? This is definitely a similar issue to the following, but different enough that I think it warrants its own question: CKEditor instance already exists
@CODE:var initEditor = function() {
  $('.js-editor-wrap').html("<textarea id='editor'></textarea>");

  var editor = CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {});

  editor.on('loaded', function() {
    console.log('editor loaded');
  });

  editor.on('instanceReady', function() {

I also set left alignment directly on the UILabel. What am I missing? The code is in UILabel extension. NSMutableParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init];

When initWithData, like in above example, html works but alignment does not work. Run this snippet and you will see. UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] init];

@TITLE:modify perceptron to become gradient descent
@CONTENT:According to this video the substantive difference between the perceptron and gradient descent algorithms are quite minor. They specified it as essentially: Perceptron: £Gwi = £b(y - ?)xi Gradient Descent: £Gwi = £b(y - £\)xi I've implemented a working version of the perceptron algorithm, but I don't understand what sections I need to change to turn it into gradient descent. Below is the load-bearing portions of my perceptron code, I suppose that these are the components I need to modify. But where? What do I need to change? I don't understand. This is left for pedagogical reasons, I've sort of figured this out but am still confused about the gradient, please see UPDATE below       iteration = 0;
      do 
      {

              output = calculateOutput( theta, weights, feature_matrix__train, p, globo_dict_size );
              // difference between predicted and actual class values
              localError = outputs__train[p] - output;
              //update weights and bias
              for (int i = 0; i < globo_dict_size; i++) 
              {
                  weights[i] += ( LEARNING_RATE * localError * feature_matrix__train[p][i] );
              }
              weights[ globo_dict_size ] += ( LEARNING_RATE * localError );

              //summation of squared error (error value for all instances)
              globalError += (localError*localError);
          }

          /* Root Mean Squared Error */
          if (iteration < 10) 
              System.out.println("Iteration 0" + iteration + " : RMSE = " + Math.sqrt( globalError/number_of_files__train ) );
          else
              System.out.println("Iteration " + iteration + " : RMSE = " + Math.sqrt( globalError/number_of_files__train ) );
      } 
      while(globalError != 0 && iteration<=MAX_ITER);
 This is the crux of my perceptron:   static int calculateOutput( int theta, double weights[], double[][] feature_matrix, int file_index, int globo_dict_size )
  {
     //double sum = x * weights[0] + y * weights[1] + z * weights[2] + weights[3];
     double sum = 0;

     for (int i = 0; i < globo_dict_size; i++) 
     {
         sum += ( weights[i] * feature_matrix[file_index][i] );
     }
     //bias
     sum += weights[ globo_dict_size ];

     return (sum >= theta) ? 1 : 0;
  }
 Is it just that I replace that caculateOutput method with something like this: public static double [] gradientDescent(final double [] theta_in, final double alpha, final int num_iters, double[][] data ) 
{
    final double m = data.length;   
    double [] theta = theta_in;
    double theta0 = 0;
    double theta1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_iters; i++) 
    {                        
        final double sum0 = gradientDescentSumScalar0(theta, alpha, data );
        final double sum1 = gradientDescentSumScalar1(theta, alpha, data);                                   
        theta0 = theta[0] - ( (alpha / m) * sum0 ); 
        theta1 = theta[1] - ( (alpha / m) * sum1 );                        
        theta = new double [] { theta0, theta1 };
    }
    return theta;
}
 UPDATE EDIT At this point I think I'm very close. I understand how to calculate the hypothesis and I think I've done that correctly, but nevertheless, something remains terribly wrong with this code. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my calculation of the gradient. When I run it the error fluctuates wildly and then goes to infinity then just NaaN.   double cost, error, hypothesis;
  double[] gradient;
  int p, iteration;

  iteration = 0;
  do 
  {
    iteration++;
    error = 0.0;
    cost = 0.0;

    //loop through all instances (complete one epoch)
    for (p = 0; p < number_of_files__train; p++) 
    {

      // 1. Calculate the hypothesis h = X * theta
      hypothesis = calculateHypothesis( theta, feature_matrix__train, p, globo_dict_size );

      // 2. Calculate the loss = h - y and maybe the squared cost (loss^2)/2m
      cost = hypothesis - outputs__train[p];

      // 3. Calculate the gradient = X' * loss / m
      gradient = calculateGradent( theta, feature_matrix__train, p, globo_dict_size, cost, number_of_files__train);

      // 4. Update the parameters theta = theta - alpha * gradient
      for (int i = 0; i < globo_dict_size; i++) 
      {
          theta[i] = theta[i] - LEARNING_RATE * gradient[i];
      }

    }

    //summation of squared error (error value for all instances)
    error += (cost*cost);

@TITLE:how is the most significant bit radix sort more efficient than the least significant bit radix sort?
@CONTENT:I was just reading the following question: Radix sort most significant first or least significant, which is faster? And the author of the accepted answer was suggesting that the MSD radix sort is indeed faster. I do not see why however. I have implemented both LSD and MSD (binary based by doing shift operations), LSD is iterative, requires just one bucket array, while MSD is recursive and requires one individual bucket array per every recursion call. If you create a random array of 10 million integers, I cannot see how MSD will be faster than LSD, since you will be allocating extra bucket arrays every time you re enter your function and also you will have to face the overhead of the recursion call themselves. I can see how the combination of MSD and LSD can give an over all boost (run MSD for the first few bits and LSD for the rest of the bits to reduce cache misses), but how is MSD alone expected to be more efficient than LSD given its recursive nature and the fact that you need a new bucket array for every recursion call, unlike LSD which is both iterative and just requires one bucket array for the entire sorting procedure?

Am I doing something wrong here? is there a way to specify a "mandatory response filter" that occurs even after short circuiting. I could see multiple uses for this beyond just logging...

 I'm building the app with Gradle via Android Studio and I would like to have another Android.mk file without LOCAL_CFLAGS := -DENABLE_DEBUG for release builds, effectively disabling logging. I tried to do it by creating the folders release/jni under src and put a copy of Android.mk without the CFLAGS. It builds and deploys successfully, but I still see the logs.

@TITLE:Automapper returns reference to the same object when mapping sequences to arrays
@CONTENT:I have an extension method for IEnumerable<T>, which maps sequence items and returns an array of clones: public static class AutoMapperExtensions

    }
}
 Here's code sample, whose behavior is weird from my point:         Mapper.CreateMap<SomeClass, SomeClass>();
        Mapper.AssertConfigurationIsValid();

        // clone list members and store them into array

@TITLE:Watchkit animation implementations: clock face, animated charts, circular progress bar
@CONTENT:I've seen some very basic demos of potential watchkit apps, and some appear to implement animations. Examples might be: A clock face with a moving second hand or even minute hand. A bar chart with bars that animate in, or who shape changes with new real-time data. A circular progress bar who's bar animates from zero to the current value. The only way I've seen so far to do animations is by a sequence of images over a duration: [imageView startAnimatingWithImagesInRange:NSMakeRange(0, 60) duration:1.0 repeatCount:0];
 How would these previous animation examples generally be implemented? I can't imagine they are all done with image sequences. I don't think one can even layer images, and coordinating placement would be a nightmare.

@TITLE:Why can't my Android device play HTML5 video loaded as Blob via XHR?
@CONTENT:I've created a sample project that downloads an entire HTML5 video source before playing it. To accomplish this I had to load the video source file via a XMLHttpRequest using a responseType: 'arraybuffer' and converting it to a Blob. This approach works fine on desktop browsers but when trying to play this on Android mobile devices the video won't play, and if I fullscreen the video on later versions of Android I'll get the following error dialog.

Is it possible to make certain URLs exempt from CSRF POST requirements in sails.js? The only configuration I can find for CSRF is to turn it on globally, and looking through the source code for the csrf hook (https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/hooks/csrf/index.js) it looks like if I try to provide a custom object, it just gets replaced with the global settings anyway.

@TITLE:In Laravel 5 how do I implement an App::before() filter?
@CONTENT:In Laravel 4.2 I had this before filter that set the Eloquent model and table based on the URL (admin.example.com vs example.com) Here is my filter code: App::before(function($request)
{       
  // Check if we are using the admin URL
  $host = $request->getHost();
  $parts = explode('.', $host);
  if ($parts[0] == 'admin')
  {
    // Set the config for user info (not sponsor)
    Config::set('auth.model', 'Admin');
    Config::set('auth.table', 'admins');
  }
});
 I tried creating middleware for this in laravel 5 and have this code: class AdminOrSponsor implements Middleware {

  public function handle($request, Closure $next)
  {   
    $host = $request->getHost();
    $parts = explode('.', $host);
    if ($parts[0] == 'admin'){
        Config::set('auth.model', 'Admin');
        Config::set('auth.table', 'admins');
    }

    return $next($request);
  }

}
 In my routes.php file I am setting the controller that is called based on the auth.model setting like this: Route::get('/auth/login', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@getLogin');
Route::post('/auth/login', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@postLogin');
Route::get('/auth/logout', Config::get('auth.model') . 'Controller@getLogout');
 What I found is that the routes are all read prior to the middleware so the change I am trying to make through Config::set() isn't happening. I am only getting the value that is set in the auth.php config file. What am I doing wrong and how should I do this in Laravel 5?
@CODE:App::before(function($request)
{       
  // Check if we are using the admin URL
  $host = $request->getHost();

  }

@TITLE:CKEditor New Instance always unloaded
@CONTENT:I'm using CKEditor in my Angular app and have a view that reloads my CKEditor instance every time users access a new model. I'm using the following JS to initialize the editor: var initEditor = function() {
  $('.js-editor-wrap').html("<textarea id='editor'></textarea>");

  var editor = CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {});

  editor.on('loaded', function() {
    console.log('editor loaded');

  editor.on('instanceReady', function() {

  if (CKEDITOR.instances['editor']) {
    CKEDITOR.instances['editor'].destroy(true);
    $('#editor').off().remove();
  }
}
 The first editor initialization works just as expected, but subsequent initializations create an editor instance with a status of "unloaded" that never triggers the "loaded" or "instanceReady" events. I'm not seeing any errors in the console. Any ideas what might be causing this? This is definitely a similar issue to the following, but different enough that I think it warrants its own question: CKEditor instance already exists
@CODE:var initEditor = function() {
  $('.js-editor-wrap').html("<textarea id='editor'></textarea>");

  var editor = CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {});

I also set left alignment directly on the UILabel. What am I missing? The code is in UILabel extension. NSMutableParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init];

 Edit Ok, so I created a separate project and there, the text is left aligned by default. I have to find out why in above example the text shows justified. In any case, the main problem remains, I can't change the default alignment. It works when initializing the attributed string with initWithString. But in this case html doesn't work. When initWithData, like in above example, html works but alignment does not work. Run this snippet and you will see. UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] init];

@TITLE:Why is my urlFetchApp function failing to successfully login
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use google apps script to login to an ASP.Net website and scrape some data that I typically have to retrieve manually. I've used Chrome Developer tools to get the correct payload names (TEXT_Username, TEXT_Password, _VIEWSTATE, _VIEWSTATEGENERATOR), I also got a ASP Net session Id to send along with my Post request. When I run my function(s) it returns a Response Code = 200 if followRedirects is set to false and returns Response Code = 302 if followRedirects is set to true. Unfortunately in neither case do the functions successfully authenticate the website. Instead the HTML returned is that of the Login Page. I've tried different header variants and parameters, but I can't seem to successfully login. Couple of other points. When I do the login in Chrome using the Developer tools, the response code appears to be 302 Found. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can successfully login to this site. Do you see any errors in my functions that could be the cause of my problems. I'm open to any and all suggestions. My GAS functions follow:     function login(cookie, viewState,viewStateGenerator) {
    var payload =
       {
         "__VIEWSTATE" : viewState,
         "__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR" : viewStateGenerator,
         "TEXT_Username" : "myUserName",
         "TEXT_Password" : "myPassword",
       };
    var header = {'Cookie':cookie};
    Logger.log(header);  
      var options =
       {
         "method" : "post",
         "payload" : payload,
         "followRedirects" : false,
         "headers" : header
       };
      var browser = UrlFetchApp.fetch("http://tnetwork.trakus.com/tnet/Login.aspx?" , options);
      Utilities.sleep(1000);
      var html = browser.getContentText();
      var response = browser.getResponseCode();
      var cookie2 = browser.getAllHeaders()['Set-Cookie'];
      Logger.log(response);
      Logger.log(html);

      }

    function loginPage() {
      var options =
       {
         "method" : "get",
         "followRedirects" : false,
       };
      var browser = UrlFetchApp.fetch("http://tnetwork.trakus.com/tnet/Login.aspx?" , options);
      var html = browser.getContentText();
     // Utilities.sleep(500);
      var response = browser.getResponseCode();
      var cookie = browser.getAllHeaders()['Set-Cookie'];
      login(cookie);
       var regExpGen = new RegExp("<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR\" id=\"__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR\" value=\"(.*)\" \/>");
     var viewStateGenerator = regExpGen.exec(html)[1];
     var regExpView = new RegExp("<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"__VIEWSTATE\" id=\"__VIEWSTATE\" value=\"(.*)\" \/>");
    var viewState = regExpView.exec(html)[1];
    var response = login(cookie,viewState,viewStateGenerator);
  return response
      }
 I call the script by running the loginPage() function. This function obtains the cookie (session id) and then calls the login function and passes along the session id (cookie).

However, on the project's Github page the following is stated: Please be aware that the Task.Run pattern used in SQLiteAsyncConnection can be considered an anti-pattern (libraries should not provide async methods unless they are truly async). This class is maintained for backwards compatibility and for use-cases where async-isolation is handy Why is using Task.Run in this case considered an anti-pattern? This allows the developer to achieve exactly the goal he needs - to run the database access code on a separate thread while the app stays responsive to user input. Would it be better to manually write Task.Run snippet each time and not use the async version of the class altogether? What are the potential issues and setbacks of this pattern?

@TITLE:Android Activity Refreshing On Rotation
@CONTENT:I'm an experienced .NET dev, but this is my first Android app and it's driving me nuts! It's a countdown timer which works fine, but when you rotate the screen it reinitialised the activity which zeroed and stopped the count down. This is what I tried; I got rid of the CountDownTimer object and instead created a class internal to the activity which extended AsyncTask so it ran on a separate thread... No change. I figured being an internal class it's being reinitialised with the activity. Here's what I tried next; I made the class an external one. The Activity passes its Context to the class and the onProgressUpdate & onPostExecute run public functions on the context to update the activity's UI. Again, this works fine until you rotate it... Aaaargh! However, I discovered that the async class is still running but the UI doesn't change because (I think) the activity now has a different context to the one the async class has reference to. So that's where I am. Each solution fixes one problem & creates another. Do I need to somehow maintain the context or am I starting to chase my own tail? Any help will be gratefully appreciated! Ta.

@TITLE:How do I switch to the active tab in Selenium?
@CONTENT:We developed a Chrome extension, and I want to test our extension with Selenium. I created a test, but the problem is that our extension opens a new tab when it's installed, and I think I get an exception from the other tab. Is it possible to switch to the active tab I'm testing? Or another option is to start with the extension disabled, then login to our website and only then enable the extension. Is it possible? Here is my code: def login_to_webapp(self):
    self.driver.get(url='http://example.com/logout')
    self.driver.maximize_window()
    self.assertEqual(first="Web Editor", second=self.driver.title)
    action = webdriver.ActionChains(driver=self.driver)
    action.move_to_element(to_element=self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath="//div[@id='header_floater']/div[@class='header_menu']/button[@class='btn_header signature_menu'][text()='My signature']"))
    action.perform()
    self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath="//ul[@id='signature_menu_downlist'][@class='menu_downlist']/li[text()='Log In']").click()
    self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath="//form[@id='atho-form']/div[@class='input']/input[@name='useremail']").send_keys("[email]")

    self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath="//form[@id='atho-form']/button[@type='submit'][@class='atho-button signin_button'][text()='Sign in']").click()
 The test fails with ElementNotVisibleException: Message: element not visible, because in the new tab (opened by the extension) "Log In" is not visible (I think the new tab is opened only after the command self.driver.get(url='http://example.com/logout')). Update: I found out that the exception is not related to the extra tab, it's from our website. But I closed the extra tab with this code, according to @aberna's answer: def close_last_tab(self):
    if (len(self.driver.window_handles) == 2):
        self.driver.switch_to.window(window_name=self.driver.window_handles[-1])
        self.driver.close()
        self.driver.switch_to.window(window_name=self.driver.window_handles[0])
 After closing the extra tab, I can see my tab in the video.

@TITLE:Enigma replica not yielding expected result
@CONTENT:I'm trying to mimic the WWII Enigma machine in Python code, following some reading in Wikipedia and other dedicated sources. Currently, I got a machine that scrambles input text and can revert the scrambled output back to input if the configuration is reset. But the problem is the code is not yielding the expected results from the very same configuration that is on Wikipedia: With the rotors I, II and III (from left to right), wide B-reflector, all ring
settings in A-position, and start position AAA, typing AAAAA will produce the
encoded sequence BDZGO.
 If I try to cipher AAAAA using the rotor and reflector configuration I find on this list, I get the ciphered text EVRDW, opposed to BDZGO that is expected. Since the text is being ciphered and can be deciphered correctly, I believe the mistake is somewhere in the texts' explanation (or my understanding of them), but I couldn't find where my code is not following the operation of an Enigma machine. Link to the code

This isn't me looking at top either and saying it looks roughly like one CPU, my ZSH config outputs the CPU % of the last command, and it always exactly 100%, never above auto NThreads = 12;
auto BlockSize = (int)std::ceil((int)(NThreads / PathCountLength));

std::vector<std::future<std::vector<unsigned __int128>>> Futures;

for (auto I = 0; I < NThreads; ++I) {
    std::cout << "HERE" << std::endl;
    unsigned __int128 Min = I * BlockSize;
    unsigned __int128 Max = I * BlockSize + BlockSize;

    if (I == NThreads - 1)
        Max = PathCountLength;

    Futures.push_back(std::async(
        [](unsigned __int128 WMin, unsigned __int128 Min, unsigned__int128 Max,

 Does anyone have any insight. I'm compiling with clang and LLVM on Arch Linux. Are there any compile flags I need, but from what I can tell C++11 standardised the thread library? Edit: If it helps anyone giving any further clues, when I comment out the local vector it runs on all cores as it should, when I drop it back in rolls back to one core. Edit 2: So I pinned down the solution, but it seems very bizarre. Returning the vector from the lambda function fixed it to one core, so now I get round this by passing in a shared_ptr to the output vector and manipulating that. And hey presto, it fires up on the cores! I figured it was pointless now using futures as I don't have a return and I'd use threads instead, nope!, using threads with no returns also uses one core. Weird eh? Fine, go back to using futures, just return an into to throw away or something. Yep you guessed it, even returning an int from the thread sticks the program to one core. Except futures can't have void lambda functions. So my solution is to pass a pointer in to store the output, to an int lambda function that never returns anything. Yeah it feels like duct tape, but I can't see a better solution. It seems so...bizzare? Like the compiler is somehow interpreting the lambda incorrectly. Could it be because I use the dev release of LLVM and not a stable branch...? Anyway my solution, because I hate nothing more than finding my problm on here and having no answer: auto NThreads = 4;

@CONTENT:In my Ruby on Rails application I am creating a cinema system, and on the bookings/new page I am allowing the user to choose the amount of seats they require through a drop down menu.

I know I will need a method for this but am unsure about how I would implement it and how I would show this message.

@TITLE:Does ngStorage perform operations asynchronously?
@CONTENT:I'm working with angular.js and ngstore. I'm using a token based authentication with a node.js REST service, from the angular app I send my credentials to rest server and I receive the token, I then store this token in $localStorage to use throughout all the angular app($localStorage.token). But it turns that sometimes $localStorage.token is undefined, even when I assigned the token to it, so when I call another rest endpoint sending the token in the headers, I'm actually sending an undefined value. Also when I try to logout I do delete $localStorage.token
 but when I check if the user has been loggedout actually the token still there. What is strange is that if I set breakpoints right after deleting the token or assigning the token and wait for a while, everything works, that's making me think that those operations may be asynchronous? Is this a common problem? How could I fix this? Any help would appreciated, Thanks. EDIT: actually I found that the problem is when using window.location, if I use $location.path it's working, but for certain reasons I need to use window.location, and it should work as far as I know

@TITLE:Query Failing in Postgres but Working in H2 (Postgres Mode)
@CONTENT:I often find myself in a situation where I want to write automated tests for my database queries. My current use case is a Spring MVC web app and a Postgres database. As far as I can tell, I have two options: Stand up an actual Postgres instance and initialize it with a test data set Utilize an in-memory database such as H2. I have used Option #1 in the past (albeit with an Oracle database and Oracle XE) with good success. The main downfall of this approach is that the tests aren't self contained. In order to successfully run the Integration Tests, you'd need to actually setup the database environment and have it accessible from wherever the tests are run. The H2 solution is more attractive in this respect because the configurations are all contained within the project. Unfortunately, I have come across a scenario where the H2 database (in Postgres mode) behaves differently than an actual Postgres instance. @Query("SELECT p FROM Project p WHERE "
        + "(:state is NULL or p.state = :state) and "
        + "(:projectType is NULL or p.projectType = :projectType))")
 The purpose of this query is to treat the two parameters (state and projectType) as optional. If the client supplies parameters with a concrete value, then return records with that value. If not, then return all records. This query works with H2, but fails in the actual Postgres instance: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: operator does not exist: character varying = bytea Hint: 
No operator matches the given name and argument type(s). You might need to add explicit type casts.
 Now I worry I can't trust my Integration Tests. The entire purpose of this work is to test that my SQL is correct. But now I can't trust that my SQL is correct even if all of my tests pass. My question is does anyone know why this error is occurring in Postgres 9 and not H2 in Postgres mode?
@CODE:@Query("SELECT p FROM Project p WHERE "
        + "(:state is NULL or p.state = :state) and "
        + "(:projectType is NULL or p.projectType = :projectType))") org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: operator does not exist: character varying = bytea Hint:

@TITLE:¡§Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated¡¨ using nodejs app.get or http-server
@CONTENT:I am creating a front end in AngularJS for a backend in node.js. I have the option of two simple node.js front end servers to serve the front end web page: one is a simple app.get in express, the other is using the http-server package. Whichever front end server code I use, I get the following browser console message in Chrome: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/. To make sure that this was not caused by anything Angular (or Bootstrap) I have cut back my webpage to the following: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" >
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>zoneshark</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
 Why am I getting the error message? Does http-server always cause this error? How can I set up a front end server using nodejs so that this error does not occur (just this simple "hello world" page would be a starting point)? The server code I am using as an alternative to http-server is: var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req,res) {
  res.sendFile('./index.html', {root: __dirname});
});

app.get(/^(.+)$/, function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile('./' + req.params[0], {root: __dirname});
});

app.listen(80);
 Another oddity. From the http-server console, it looks like http-server is serving two resources: /index.html as expected, but also /favicon.ico - which is odd as this is not mentioned anywhere. The final oddity: this only happens from Chrome. From IE there is no issue, and no favicon.ico is called for. In Chrome, I have cleared all browsing data, except autofill form data, passwords and content licences.

@LINK:/questions/28507040/finding-all-combinations-of-multiple-variables-summing-to-1
@TITLE:Finding all combinations of multiple variables summing to 1
@CONTENT:I am trying to solve the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + .... + xn = 1
 where the values of all xi are restricted to [0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1]. Currently, I am solving the problem by first generating an n-dimensional array mat, where at each element location the value is the sum of the axis values, which vary in axisValues = 0:0.1:1: mat(i,j,k,...,q) = axisValues(i) + axisValues(j) + ... + axisValues(q).
 Then I search for all entries of the resulting array that are equal to one. The code (shown below for further clarification) is working fine and has been tested for up to 5 dimensions. The problem is, that the run time increases exponentially and I need the script to work for more than a few dimensions. clear all
dim = 2; % The dimension of the matrix is defined here. The script has been tested for dim ? 5
fractiles(:,1) = [0:0.1:1]; % Produces a vector containing the initial axis elements, which will be used to calculate the matrix elements
fractiles = repmat(fractiles,1,dim); % multiplies the vector to supply dim rows with the axis elements 0:0.1:1. These elements will be changed later, but the symmetry will remain the same.
dim_len = repmat(size(fractiles,1),1,size(fractiles,2)); % Here, the length of the dimensions is checked, which his needed to initialize the matrix mat, which will be filled with the axis element sums
mat = zeros(dim_len); % Here the matrix mat is initialized
Sub=cell(1,dim);
mat_size = size(mat);
% The following for loop fills each matrix elements of the dim dimensional matrix mat with the sum of the corresponding dim axis elements.
for ind=1:numel(mat)
    [Sub{:}]=ind2sub(mat_size,ind);
    SubMatrix=cell2mat(Sub);
    sum_indices = 0;
    for j = 1:dim
        sum_indices = sum_indices+fractiles(SubMatrix(j),j);
    end
    mat(ind) = sum_indices;
end
Ind_ones = find(mat==1); % Finally, the matrix elements equal to one are found.
 I have the feeling that the following idea using the symmetry of the problem might help to significantly reduce calculation time: For a 2D matrix, all entries that fulfill the condition above lie on the diagonal from mat(1,11) to mat(11,1), i.e. from the maximal value of x1 to the maximal value of x2. For a 3D Matrix, all entries fulfill the condition that lie on a diagonal plane through mat(1,1,11), mat(1,11,1), mat(11,1,1), i.e. from the maximal value of x1 and x2 to the maximal value of x3. The same is true for higher dimensions: All matrix elements of interest lie on an n-1 dimensional hyper-plane fixed on the highest axis value in each dimension. The question is: Is there a way to directly determine the indices of the elements on these n-1 dimensional hyper-plane? If so, the whole problem could be solved in one step and without needing to calculate all entries of the n-dimensional matrix and then searching for the entries of interest.
@CODE:x1 + x2 + x3 + .... + xn = 1 xi [0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1] mat axisValues = 0:0.1:1 mat(i,j,k,...,q) = axisValues(i) + axisValues(j) + ... + axisValues(q). clear all

@TITLE:Serialization member by member
@CONTENT:I've implemented a template<typename T> Serializer that works on any trivially copyable object of type T, just serializing sizeof(T) bytes. Then I've implemented a couple of (partial) specializations for other types of interest, like std::vector<T> and std::bacis_string<T>. For other types, I trigger a static_assert(is_trivially_copyable<T>::type, "Unsupported type");. This is not what I want, because I want to avoid serializing, for example, types with naked pointers, like: struct C_style_vector{
    size_t size;
    int* ptr;
};
 For such kind of types, I assume that the user will define an ad hoc specialization. Conversely, as far as now my Serializer doesn't work with a type like this: struct Simple_type{
    double d;
    std::vector<int> v;
};
 even though every member of Simple_type is serializable by my class. So, how can I catch types with naked pointers? And how can I tell my serializer to serialize types composed only by serializable members, serializing it member by member?

 Is there any easy way to pass $progressPerc from main.pl to the function progress() every time it changes its value? If there was only one call, this could be done using ajax, however, I don't know how to use ajax for several calls i.e. dynamically; by 'dynamic' I mean that once a perl script in main.pl is finished, this should be reported to the progress bar which is then updated. If there is no easy way to do this: Can one somehow introduce an if clause that checks every x minutes (using setTimeout) whether the output files produced by these perl scripts in main.pl exist and if so, the progress bar is updated and if not one waits for longer? And if so, how would it be implemented? I am still rather new to the topic on how one can connect perl and jQuery so please go easy on me. :) Thanks a lot!

 Every time I run it I get the error "Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'input' not found" I can't seem to fix this.

@TITLE:How to give correct suggestions to tab complete when my words contains colons
@CONTENT:I am writing a bash tab completion file for a utility that some times requires full URLs on the form: protocol://host:port. This contains two colons, which have proven to be problematic for tab completion. This is because the colons are treated as word breaks. I have read that I should not change COMP_WORDBREAKS directly, so I want to use the _get_comp_words_by_ref and __ltrim_colon_completions as suggested here: How to reset COMP_WORDBREAKS without effecting other completion script? This works for a single colon, but the second colon causes a small problem as demonstrated in this minimal example: This example shows the problem. It occurs for any number of colons in the suggestions. [root@2e3e8853cc0c /]# cat /etc/bash_completion.d/foo 
_foo()
{
    local cur
    COMPREPLY=()
    _get_comp_words_by_ref -n : -c cur

    COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "http://host:1234/aaa http://host:1234/bbb http://host:1234/ccc" -- ${cur}) )
    __ltrim_colon_completions "$cur"
    return 0
}
complete -F _foo foo
 Hitting tab after foo successfully completes the common part. Hitting tab twice after that, yields the following suggestions: [root@2e3e8853cc0c /]# foo http://host:1234/
1234/aaa  1234/bbb  1234/ccc
 The desired result is ofcourse: [root@2e3e8853cc0c /]# foo http://host:1234/
http://host:1234/aaa  http://host:1234/bbb  http://host:1234/ccc
 After that, hitting a, b, or c plus tab works as expected, it completes the full URL. Any suggestions to how I can produce the right output? Do I need to manually change the COMPREPLY variable, or am I just using the functions wrong?

@CONTENT:We have earlier experiences and lots of reusable code/components mostly done using Spring MVC, Hibernate, PostgreSQL database. But recently we are planning to start a new project. We decided to use Play framework with Scala. We are new in Play framework with Scala. Thus we couldn't decided what ORM (Object-relational mapping) framework to use. Because of many reusable code, we wish to select Hibernate. We found scary words regarding Hibernate as "JPA using Hibernate in Scala with play it is probably not the best way, and it should be considered as legacy and deprecated". We are really confused what to use? While searching for possibilities we found Anorm and Hibernate. There could be some other framework exist, that we don't know yet. So please suggest us what to use for Play framework with Scala and PostgreSQL? Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Objective C - Self Zeroing weak pointer unexpected behaviour
@CONTENT:I have recently upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite and now my unit tests are failing. The problem boiled down to a typo in a weak pointer to string content. Please see the following sample code: NSString* value1;
NSString* value2;
__weak NSString* weakValue1;
__weak NSString* weakValue2;
NSMutableString* resultText = [NSMutableString new];

@autoreleasepool
{
    value1 = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Hello: %d", 1];
    value2 = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Hello %d", 2];
    weakValue1 = value1;
    weakValue2 = value2;

    [resultText appendFormat: @"  value1 = %@", weakValue1];
    [resultText appendFormat: @"  value2 = %@", weakValue2];

    value1 = nil;
    value2 = nil;
}
[resultText appendFormat: @"  value1 = %@", weakValue1];
[resultText appendFormat: @"  value2 = %@", weakValue2];

NSLog( @"resultText = %@", resultText );
 The output of this code is: resultText =   value1 = Hello: 1  value2 = Hello 2  value1 = (null)  value2 = Hello 2
 I would have expected: resultText =   value1 = Hello: 1  value2 = Hello 2  value1 = (null)  value2 = (null)
 the second value2 to also be (null) but it is not. Please notice the difference between the content of value1 and value2. value2 is missing the colon. I do not understand why weakValue2 does not self zero when value2 is set to nil. As soon as I put the colon back in the string I get the results I expect. I was not seeing this behaviour when running this code in Mavericks. Does anyone know why this is happening? I noticed in this question that the valid point of multithreading could cause a weak pointer to not self zero in time, but that is not what is happening here. Firstly, I am not multithreaded and I get the exact same result if I step through the code and view the variables rather than printing them with NSLog.
@CODE:NSString* value1;
NSString* value2;
__weak NSString* weakValue1;
__weak NSString* weakValue2;
NSMutableString* resultText = [NSMutableString new];

@autoreleasepool
{
    value1 = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Hello: %d", 1];
    value2 = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Hello %d", 2];
    weakValue1 = value1;
    weakValue2 = value2;

    [resultText appendFormat: @"  value1 = %@", weakValue1];
    [resultText appendFormat: @"  value2 = %@", weakValue2];

    value1 = nil;
    value2 = nil;
}

 I have two ideas right now: Main has already exited for some reason. This is a PoC, so when there's an error we log to stdout and call exit() (Yeah I know, not the greatest, this is being adapted from another C-style program written in C++). I do not see anything being logged to the terminal, but I suppose it's possible that the output was being buffered and hasn't been written out yet? The debugger is lying to me in some way. Usually it puts in [frames below may be missing/incorrect] into the stack trace when it does this, but maybe it can happen without that.

@CONTENT:How can I calculate a floating point multiplicand in Verilog? So far, I usually use shift << 1024 , then floating point number become to integer. Then I do some operations, then >> 1024 to obtain a fraction again. For example 0.3545 = 2^-2 + 2^-4 + ... I have question about another way, like this. I don't know where does the minus (-) comes from: 0.46194 = 2^-1 - 2^-5 - 2^-7 + 2^-10. I have just look this from someone. but as you way, that is represented like this 0.46194 = 2^-2 + 2^-3 + 2^-4 + 2^-6 + 2^-7 + 2^-10 + .... . I don't understand how does it know the minus is used it? How do we know when the minus needed to it? Also how can I apply to verilog RTL? UPDATE : I understand the concept the using minus in operation. But Is there any other way to equation or methodologies what to make reduce expression what multiplying with power of 2? UPDATE : how can we use this method in verilog? for example, I have leaned 0.46194 = 2^-1 - 2^-5 - 2^-7 + 2^-10. then this code was written like this in verilog. 0.011101101 ='hED = 'd237. So the point of the question is how can we apply it to application in verilog? UPDATE : Sir Would you please check this one? there are a little difference result. 0.46194 = 0.011101101. I just tried like this 0.011101101 0.100T10T01 = 2^-1 - 2^-4 + 2^-5 - 2^-7 + 2^-9. = 0.462890625 Something different. What do I wrong?

 The script that uses this works roughly as follows: Create an environment for running a tool. Has many print, warn and possibly die statements. Run the tool (Currently using system command). This produces a lot of output which I want to appear on STDOUT, but not in the logfile (The tool creates its own logfile). Analyze the results, cleanup and exit. Has many print, warn and possibly die statements. Everything works correctly except I would like to exclude the output of step 2 from the log. Is there a simple way to achieve this? Thanks, PS: This is my first question on stackoverflow. Please help me in asking questions correctly if I have not done so.

@TITLE:Why doesn't std::reference_wrapper implicitly cast to a reference when calling member function?
@CONTENT:I don't understand exactly why one cannot use a std::reference_wrapper like this: #include <vector>
#include <functional>

struct Foo
{
    void f() {};
};

int main()

 Why do we have to use the get() member function? It looks like std::reference_wrapper has an implicit conversion to T& via operator T&() const noexcept, see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/reference_wrapper so why isn't v[0] implicitly converted to a reference? In other situations, such as std::cout << v[0] << std::endl
 this conversion takes place (I assume here that Foo overloads operator<<)
@CODE:std::reference_wrapper #include <vector>
#include <functional>

struct Foo
{
    void f() {};
};

int main()
{
    std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<Foo>> vrFoo;

    vrFoo[0].get().f(); // or static_cast<Foo&>(v[0]).f();
} get() std::reference_wrapper T& operator T&() const noexcept v[0] std::cout << v[0] << std::endl Foo operator<< operator.

@CONTENT:I have a big problem with the addition of a mysql database to Glassfish. I did all the steps located here http://www.onehippo.org/library/deployment/configuring/configuring-hippo-7-for-mysql.html . When I use $ mvn clean install
$ mvn -P cargo.run
 It's looks fine, because in my workspace.xml I have : <FileSystem class="org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.DbFileSystem">

  <param name="driver" value="javax.naming.InitialContext"/>

  <param name="schema" value="mysql"/>
</FileSystem>
 next I use $ mvn clean install
$ mvn -P dist
 and deploy created cms.war and site.war to glassfish server (Previously, I copied all the libraries and everything works. Inspired by https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/hippo_tip_deploying_hippo_to ). All of project works fine. The problem is the database. In new workspace.xml in glassfish (/opt/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/applications/cms/WEB-INF/storage/workspaces/default/workspace.xml) I have: <FileSystem class="org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.local.LocalFileSystem">

 and server created db.h2.db file in storage/workspace/default, but I need a base in mysql. What can I do wrong? Additional question. How to check what is in the database? In mysql hippo created something like this: +--------------------+

@LINK:/questions/28338450/prevent-removal-of-dom-elements-on-the-tumblr-dashboard
@TITLE:Prevent removal of DOM elements on the Tumblr dashboard
@CONTENT:NOTE: This is a follow-up question to my previous one. I decided to keep the posts displayed on the dashboard by my extension inside the #posts element. Now my problem is that Tumblr automatically removes posts' content while scrolling. Here is an example of a normal post before the removal: <li class="post_container" data-pageable="post_110141415125">
    <div class="post post_full ..." [...]>
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
</li>
 And the same post, after the removal of its content: <li class="post_container" data-pageable="post_110141415125" style="border-radius: 3px; height: 207px; width: 540px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
</li>
 Since that my extension re-positions the posts into a pinterest-like layout, the removal of posts' content messes up the entire layout. Is it possible to stop the Tumblr dashboard from removing the DOM elements inside each .post? EDIT: I added this injection code for the removeChild method in my content script: function addScript(){
    var script = document.createElement('script');  
    script.id = 'newRemoveChildScript'; ///just to find is faster in the code
    script.src = chrome.extension.getURL("injectedCode.js");
    $($('script')[0]).before(script); ///Script is indeed present, I checked that
}

window.onload = addScript;
 The next I did, was to create the injectedCode.js file with the second version, looking like this: (function (obj, method) {
    function isPost(el) {
        return (/^post_\d+$/.test(el.id) && ~el.className.indexOf('post'));
    }
    obj[method] = (function (obj_method) {
        return function (child) {
            if (isPost(child)) return child;
            return obj_method.apply(this, arguments);
        }
    }(obj[method]));
}(Element.prototype, 'removeChild'));
 When I load the Tumblr-Dashboard I can confirm that the Script-element is present in the head-element. The file is also properly linked, because the 'removeChild' function is called once. A script element is being removed there, it seems. From that point on, the function is never called again and I can see those 'empty' posts again.
@CODE:#posts <li class="post_container" data-pageable="post_110141415125">
    <div class="post post_full ..." [...]>
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
</li> <li class="post_container" data-pageable="post_110141415125" style="border-radius: 3px; height: 207px; width: 540px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
</li> .post removeChild function addScript(){
    var script = document.createElement('script');  
    script.id = 'newRemoveChildScript'; ///just to find is faster in the code
    script.src = chrome.extension.getURL("injectedCode.js");
    $($('script')[0]).before(script); ///Script is indeed present, I checked that
}

window.onload = addScript; injectedCode.js (function (obj, method) {
    function isPost(el) {
        return (/^post_\d+$/.test(el.id) && ~el.className.indexOf('post'));
    }
    obj[method] = (function (obj_method) {
        return function (child) {
            if (isPost(child)) return child;
            return obj_method.apply(this, arguments);
        }
    }(obj[method]));
}(Element.prototype, 'removeChild'));

@TITLE:Celery + Eventlet + non blocking requests
@CONTENT:I am using Python requests in celery workers to make large number of (~10/sec) API calls(includes GET,POST, PUT, DELETE). Each request takes around 5-10s to complete. I tried running celery workers in eventlet pool, with 1000 concurrency. Since requests are blocking process each concurrent connection is waiting on one request. How do I make requests asynchronous?

@LINK:/questions/28311141/decorators-for-selective-caching-memoization
@TITLE:Decorators for selective caching / memoization
@CONTENT:I am looking for a way of building a decorator @memoize that I can use in functions as follows: @memoize
my_function(a, b, c):
    # Do stuff 
    # result may not always be the same for fixed (a,b,c)
return result
 Then, if I do: result1 = my_function(a=1,b=2,c=3)
# The function f runs (slow). We cache the result for later

result2 = my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3)
# The decorator reads the cache and returns the result (fast)
 Now say that I want to force a cache update: result3 = my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3, force_update=True)
# The function runs *again* for values a, b, and c. 

result4 = my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3)
# We read the cache
 At the end of the above, we always have result4 = result3, but not necessarily result4 = result, which is why one needs an option to force the cache update for the same input parameters. How can I approach this problem? Note on joblib As far as I know joblib supports .call, which forces a re-run, but it does not update the cache. Follow-up on using klepto: Is there any way to have klepto (see @Wally's answer) cache its results by default under a specific location? (e.g. /some/path/) and share this location across multiple functions? E.g. I would like to say cache_path = "/some/path/"
 and then @memoize several functions in a given module under the same path.
@CODE:@memoize @memoize
my_function(a, b, c):
    # Do stuff 
    # result may not always be the same for fixed (a,b,c)
return result result1 = my_function(a=1,b=2,c=3)
# The function f runs (slow). We cache the result for later

result2 = my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3)
# The decorator reads the cache and returns the result (fast) result3 = my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3, force_update=True)
# The function runs *again* for values a, b, and c. 

result4 = my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3)
# We read the cache result4 = result3 result4 = result joblib joblib .call klepto klepto /some/path/ cache_path = "/some/path/" @memoize functools.lru_cache

@TITLE:Filters issue with Angular
@CONTENT:I have a big little issue with the filters on Angular, to be explicit: input search with a filter attached. if you see this example, is exactly what I want actually I did that Plnkr with the real information of my app. You can search through sports and his leagues, but in my app you can not, you can just search through the sports and once you try to search any leagues, the app returns a message "did not match any search criteria", below I will put all of the code regarding this issue, someone says it could be a routing issue or that I am missing a resolve or something like that, that's why I am here, because I need your help. Also I recorded a VIDEO for you to understand easier, as you see on the video if I put "college" the filter works, but below there are 2 leagues starting with "ncaa", if I type "ncaa" then the empty message shows up. It is weird because in the Plnkr example everything works properly. sportsList.html <input type="text"

@TITLE:Conecting AWS Lambda to Redshift - Times out after 60 seconds
@CONTENT:I created an AWS Lambda function that: logs onto Redshift via JDBC URL runs a query Locally, using Node, I can successfully connect to the Redshift instance via JDBC, and execute a query. var conString = "postgresql://USER_NAME:PASSWORD@JDBC_URL¡¨;
var client = new pg.Client(conString);
client.connect(function(err) {   
  if(err) {?            
      console.log('could not connect to redshift', err);?          
  }  ?          
// omitted due to above error
 However, when I execute the function on AWS Lambda (where it's wrapped in a async#waterfall block), AWS Cloudwatch logs tells me that the AWS Lambda function timed out after 60 seconds. Any ideas on why my function is not able to connect?
@CODE:var conString = "postgresql://USER_NAME:PASSWORD@JDBC_URL¡¨;

@TITLE:IOS App Submission Routing App
@CONTENT:I am trying to submit my app for review in Itunes Connect, but when I try to submit it I get an error saying "To confifugre this app as an IOS routing app, upload a routing app coverage file on the app's Version page in My Apps on iTunes Connect. To configure your app as an IOS routing app, the app's Info.plist must contain the MKDirectionsApplicationSupportedModes key." So in my project, in the Capabilities, the Maps is turned off. I do have the MapKit.framework in my project, as I do utilize the map, however I do not ever show routing information nor provide it in my app. Is the fact that this framework in my project causing this Itunes Connect error, and if so, how do I go about fixing it. And by fixing it, I want it to turn off routing. My app is not made to provide routing information, nor do I want to set it as an IOS routing app. Any help would be appreciated I am using xcode 6.

@CONTENT:To make things easier, here is a JSFiddle of what I have. TRY In FireFox (version 35.0.1) pan the map. Click and hold anywhere on the map, and move it about quickly left and right. Panning movement should be quick and smooth. Now try the same in Chrome and you'll see that it is not as smooth! It is a bit jerky/laggy. I find it laggy in the latest version of IE and Opera too. By the way, if you comment out this style block, then behaviour all of a sudden smooths out and stops being laggy! You won't get a nice map of course. #map path {

 SO WHAT? First of all I would appreciate it if someone can confirm this behaviour on their PCs. I am on Windows 8.1 with all latest updates. And then, why isn't this behaviour happening on other maps done with D3? This one for example behaves smoothly! Is it to do with the complexity of the polygons?

@TITLE:Why does IE11 create blank post request except when Fiddler is running?
@CONTENT:My AngularJS $http post requests to my C# WebAPI restful service fail on Windows 8.1 in Internet Explorer 11. Firefox and Chrome both work. Some more details: The IT department says our network has no proxy All 'automatically detect' and 'use proxy' settings are unchecked in all browsers The requests fail to IIS both on my localhost and running the site and service on a local server Enhanced protection mode of IE11 is off The request's connection header is 'keep-alive' (I tried 'close' too and it still failed) Sometimes one request will succeed and only from the second request will everything fail No error is shown - the request in IE's network tab just says 'Pending' and all headers and body are blank I'm using HTTP, not HTTPS I've tried the meta tag 'X-UA-Compatible' IE9 and Edge The requests fail for colleagues using IE11 on their machines too All calls in all browsers work perfectly when Fiddler is running Visual Studio 2013 browser link is turned off (so the SignalRArtery JS file isn't constantly making calls to the server and interfering with testing) My AngularJS request call looks like this: var url = UrlService.GetUrlOfApi() + 'Account/SignIn';
var postData = { 'username' : username, 'password' : password };
$http(
{
    'url': url,
    'data': postData,
    'method': 'POST'
})
.success(function (data)
{
     ...
 My C# service looks like this: [RoutePrefix("Account")]
[AllowAnonymous]
public class AccountController : BaseController
{        
    [ResponseType(typeof(SecureResponseModel))]
    [Route("SignIn")]
    [HttpPost]
    public IHttpActionResult SignIn(HttpRequestMessage request)
    {
        try
        {
            var userSignInDetails = GetPostData<AuthenticationRequestMessage>(request);
            var token = _hisManager.AuthenticateUser(userSignInDetails.Username, userSignInDetails.Password);
            return new SignInResponseMessage(token, ApiErrorCode.success, Request);
        }
        catch(APIException e)
        {
            throw;
        }
    }
 This is what a failing call looks like in IE11, totally blank: This is what a successful calls looks like when Fiddler is running: Can anyone recommend any other settings to check or things to try please?

@LINK:/questions/28195005/sqlite-data-to-a-recyclerview
@TITLE:SQLite data to a RecyclerView
@CONTENT:The app has data in a SQLite database. The UI is primarily a RecyclerView. The question is how to best to transfer data from the database into the UI, whilst keeping off the main thread? I originally planned to use a CursorLoader, ContentProvider, and RecyclerView. But reading around it looks like RecyclerView has no out-of-the-box support for Cursor-supplied data. Dang. That then leaves me with a few other options... AsyncTask to load the data, put it into model objects, and pass into the RecyclerView Adapter. Aside from being ugly, it isn't config-change friendly. A custom Loader that loads the data from SQL and pushes it into model objects. Use a Cursor loader, and when it returns the Cursor iterate through it to push the data into model objects. I suspect this would occur on the main thread and may damage performance. Use Otto to send a request message to request data, and then return a model objects collection by return message. There may be ~500 objects so I think I may rather abusing Otto doing this. If I am using a collection of model objects instead of a Cursor I see less benefit to a ContentProvider, and I also lose the ability for the UI to auto-refresh on data changes (which may be useful). None of these options appeal much, is there a better way? The app is under time pressure so whatever it is needs to be fairly quick to implement. Unfortunately the UI needs to scroll horizontally and only targets Lollipop, so RecyclerView does seem a better bet than ListView.

}
 To clarify, timelineTableViewController has one class that inherits, MessageTableCell. It's also part of a project that I've integrated into Objective-C code, so it's a combination of both Swift and ObjC. I've run both projects (the swift one and the ObjC one) independently and they work fine; it's only when I try to run it together do they mess up. Any suggestions? I'm at an utter loss for this.

@TITLE:Oracle JDBC prefetch: how to avoid running out of RAM
@CONTENT:Using Oracle java JDBC (ojdbc14 10.2.x), loading a query with many rows takes forever (high latency environment. This is apparently the default prefetch in Oracle JDBC is default size "10" which requires a round trip time once per 10 rows. I am attempting to set an aggressive prefetch size to avoid this.  PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from tablename");
 statement.setFetchSize(10000);
 ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
 This can work, but instead I get an out of memory exception. I had presumed that setFetchSize would tell it to buffer "that many rows" as they come in, using as much RAM as each row requires. If I run with 50 threads, even with 16G of -XMX space, it runs out of memory. Feels almost like a leak: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

@TITLE:Swift behaves differently on debug and release mode
@CONTENT:Not sure if that's an issue with Swift, XCode or Alamofire but I recognized strange behavior on different places within my mixed Swift/Objc app. It only happens in parts which are written in Swift and use closures/networking. Here's an example code where it happens: Alamofire.request(.DELETE, "http://someUrl.com/user", parameters: nil)
     .response { (request, response, data, error) in
                 // some cleanup code and an alert
               }
 When I run my app in Debug mode on my iPhone then it all just works, the cleanup code and the alert get presented like they should when I do the "delete account" action which runs the code above. But when I send my app to users via Testflight or run my app on the same iPhone directly but using the Release build configuration then the cleanup code doesn't run and the alert doesn't show up. It looks like the whole closure doesn't get called. Does anyone have experiences with such strange behaviors and knows how to prevent them? I'm not sure what's the issue here, therefore it is hard for me to figure out a solution that works on both Debug and Release modes. Thank you for any help! The environment: I'm using Alamofire 1.1.3 as an embedded framework integrated to my project as a git submodule. The app runs on iOS 8+ only, I have iOS 8.1.2 installed on my iPhone 6.

@TITLE:Fighting with -webkit-filter: blur and not solid edges (works with filter: blur)
@CONTENT:I have written this pen EDIT see this pen of Alexander Omara for a shorter version of my pen basically we set the bg span to always be more than full screen, even on resize. The blurry edges should be removed by using the known "use a container around the image that is smaller than the image" to cut off the blurry edges. This container has the size of the actual screen view port. Now this works perfectly fine in the newest firefox 35. But it fails so hard in webkit browsers e.g. tested in chrome 40.0.2214.91 m. First of all, there is the green bg from body visible, after the text it disappears ?! and shows a whitish blur. That's not even all, if you use the horizontal scroll (i don't really want a horizontal scroll actually) The greenish background from the body disappears . If you scroll left again, it reappears. The blurry edge is coming from the edge of the browser window, next to the scrollbar, it is not coming from the actual image edge. You can see it by the green background, when scrolling left and right, and that the green turns into white. Magic. Pull the plug on this and have our webkit community fix it. Or is there a fix to this I somehow am overlooking?

@LINK:/questions/28131214/custom-input-view-as-keyboard-for-textfield-in-swift-using-osx-10-9-and-xcode-6
@TITLE:Custom input view as keyboard for textfield in Swift using OSX 10.9 and Xcode 6.1.1 +
@CONTENT:I am having trouble with connecting buttons after I load a custom input view keyboard. My main screens are storyboard and my custom view is a xib. The input view is a nib with the file owner pointing to its swift class. I am loading the input view with code in another view controller using: extension UIView {
class func loadFromNibNamed(nibNamed: String, bundle : NSBundle? = nil) -> UIView? {
    return UINib(
        nibName: nibNamed,
        bundle: bundle
        ).instantiateWithOwner(nil, options: nil)[0] as? UIView
}
}
 Inside thie main view controller I'm creating the input view with: var myInputView = UIView.loadFromNibNamed("keypadInputViewController", bundle: nil)
 keypadInputViewController is the base name of the xib and its swift file and the classname in the swift file. I attach this keyboard using: self.widthBox.inputView = self.myInputView
 The keyboard view then opens as a regular ios keyboard opens The problem is as soon as I add connectors for buttons from the keypadInputViewController xib to its swift I'll get crash message. The message specifically referrs to any connections I've created. "this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key" The xib contains a view with a dozen buttons. I've double checked a number of items including: File Owner is set to keypadInputViewController ran clean in Xcode ran reset in iOS simulator manually deleted derived files in library deleted reference and re-added xib and swift file to project deleted all connections from xib to swift in both, file owner and view sections closed and reopened Xcode tried the beta 4 for Xcode 6.2 I have opened xcode and created a test ios project, added a cocoa touch class and used the create xib checkbox. The test project fails with the same error as soon as I add button connections. After searching for quite a long time I found that not setting owner to self would not allow button connections to function. So I changed the extension to: extension UIView {
class func loadFromNibNamed(nibNamed: String, bundle : NSBundle? = nil) -> UIView? {
    return UINib(
        nibName: nibNamed,
        bundle: bundle
        ).instantiateWithOwner(self, options: nil)[0] as? UIView
}}
 I still cannot set the view to the file owner. The app crashes on compile if an outlet is connected, or on button press if an action is connected, with the error, "unrecognized selector sent to class" I don't know if it is me or if it is Xcode. How do I go about getting this keyboard view to accept connections so I can move on? I'm thinking perhaps I didn't add something important to the class definations or am not loading this xib correctly. Ideas?
@CODE:extension UIView {
class func loadFromNibNamed(nibNamed: String, bundle : NSBundle? = nil) -> UIView? {
    return UINib(
        nibName: nibNamed,
        bundle: bundle
        ).instantiateWithOwner(nil, options: nil)[0] as? UIView
}
} var myInputView = UIView.loadFromNibNamed("keypadInputViewController", bundle: nil) self.widthBox.inputView = self.myInputView extension UIView {
class func loadFromNibNamed(nibNamed: String, bundle : NSBundle? = nil) -> UIView? {
    return UINib(
        nibName: nibNamed,
        bundle: bundle
        ).instantiateWithOwner(self, options: nil)[0] as? UIView
}}

@LINK:/questions/28126351/end-perl-script-without-waiting-for-system-call-to-return
@TITLE:End perl script without waiting for system call to return
@CONTENT:I'm running a simple apache web server on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) with a perl CGI script handling some requests. The script initiates a system command using the system function, but I want it to return immediately, regardless of the outcome of the system call. I've been adding an ampersand to the end of the scalar argument passed to system (I am aware of the implications of command injection attacks) and although this does cause the system command to return immediately, the script will still not exit until the underlying command has completed. If I trigger a dummy ruby script with a 10 second sleep using the system call from the perl CGI, then my request to the web server still waits 10 seconds before finally getting a response. I put a log statement after the system call and it appears immediately when the web request is made, so the system call is definitely returning immediately, but the script is still waiting at the end. This question is similar, but neither of the solutions have worked for me. Here's some example code: #!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;
use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

Log::Log4perl->easy_init(
    { level => $DEBUG, file => ">>/var/log/script.log" } );

print "Content-type: application/json\n\n";
my $cgi = CGI->new();

INFO("Executing command...");
system('sudo -u on-behalf-of-user /tmp/test.rb one two &');
INFO("Command initiated - will return now...");

print '{"error":false}';
 Edit: The command call is executed using sudo -u because the apache user www-data needs permission to execute the script on behalf of the script owner, and I've updated my sudoers file appropriately to that end. This is not the cause of my issue, because I've also tried changing script ownership to www-data and running system("/tmp/test.rb one two &") but result is the same. Edit 2: I've also tried adding exit 0 to the very end of the script, but it doesn't make any difference. Is it possible that the script is exiting immediately, but the apache server is holding onto the response until the script the perl CGI called is finished? Or is it possible that some setting or configuration of the operating system is causing the problem? Edit 3: Running the perl CGI script directly from a terminal works correctly. The perl script ends immediately, so this is not an inherent issue with Perl. Which presumably can only mean that the Apache web server is holding onto the request until the command called from system is finished. Why?
@CODE:system system system system system #!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;
use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

Log::Log4perl->easy_init(
    { level => $DEBUG, file => ">>/var/log/script.log" } );

print "Content-type: application/json\n\n";
my $cgi = CGI->new();

INFO("Executing command...");
system('sudo -u on-behalf-of-user /tmp/test.rb one two &');
INFO("Command initiated - will return now...");

print '{"error":false}'; sudo -u www-data www-data system("/tmp/test.rb one two &") exit 0 system system

@TITLE:JavaFX-CSS: How to ¡§move¡¨ style of parent to a child?
@CONTENT:The trigger for this was a quick experiment to solve TreeItem selection width: the requirement is to highlight only the text, not the whole tree cell. Nothing easier than that (said Frederik :) implement a custom TreeCell with a Label as graphic (and configure the label with the item as needed) remove the selection style (mostly the highlight background from the cell add the highlight style to the label Something like (a runnable example using this is at the end): public static class MyTreeCell extends TreeCell<String> {

    private Label label;

    public MyTreeCell() {
        getStyleClass().add("tree-text-only");
    }
    @Override
    public void updateItem(String item, boolean empty) {
        super.updateItem(item, empty);
        if (empty) {
            setText(null);
            setGraphic(null);
        } else {
            if (label == null) {
                label = new Label();
            }
            label.setText(item);
            setGraphic(label);
        }
    }
}
 The css: /* remove the highlight from cell as a whole, 
   c&p'd the unselected style from modena */
.tree-text-only:filled:selected {
    -fx-background: -fx-control-inner-background; 
    -fx-background-color: -fx-background;
}
/* c&p'd selected style */
/* using > doesn't make a different to the behaviour */ 
/* .tree-text-only:filled:selected > .label { */

.tree-text-only:filled:selected .label {
    /* following is the selection color from themes, doesn't show */
    -fx-background: -fx-selection-bar; 
    /* hard-coded color does show */
    /*   -fx-background-color: -fx-accent ; */
    /* auto-adjust text fill */
    /* no effect for hard-coded color, showing nothing for selection bar */
    -fx-text-fill: -fx-text-background-color;
}
 Expected behaviour label has highlighted background when using selection-bar text auto-adjusts its fill Actual behaviour: using the "semantic" (?) highlight color selection-bar, the background color of the label is not changed to the highlight color but the text fill is changed to the "white", so the text doesn't show using a hard-coded color (any, even the accent as above) changes the label's background but the text fill isn't updated The obvious question: How to make it work as expected? For convenience, a runnable example: public class TreeCellExample extends Application {

    public static class MyTreeCell extends TreeCell<String> {

        private Label label;

        public MyTreeCell() {
            getStyleClass().add("tree-text-only");
        }
        @Override
        public void updateItem(String item, boolean empty) {
            super.updateItem(item, empty);
            if (empty) {
                setText(null);
                setGraphic(null);
            } else {
                if (label == null) {
                    label = new Label();
                }
                label.setText(item);
                setGraphic(label);
            }
        }
    }

    private Parent getContent() {

@CONTENT:I use ZF2, Doctrine2, MySQL, Gearman. When working Gearman periodically has an error: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away.

For example, this is EXPLAIN of one of queries when MySQL server has gone away. +-------------+-------+-------+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+-------+------+

 2) I tried the version from this post (for reconnect to DB) But it's not help me. And some of my queries was lost. 3) I disabled all Gearman jobs and workers except 3 for testing. I cleaned Gearman queues and restart Gearman server and Gearman workers. But it's not help me. 4) I enabled these settings for MySQL: max_allowed_packet = 500M    max_connections      = 2000
   max_user_connections = 300
   wait_timeout         = 3600

 Can someone help? Thanks!

@CONTENT:I'm working on a Xamarin.Forms app using a page that displays a map. The XAML is: <maps:Map x:Name="Map">

 I know that the map can be accessed from the page's code-behind like this: var position = new Position(37.79762, -122.40181);
Map.MoveToRegion(new MapSpan(position, 0.01, 0.01));
Map.Pins.Add(new Pin
{
    Label = "Xamarin",
    Position = position
});
 But because this code would break the app's MVVM architecture, I'd rather like to access the Map object from my ViewModel, not directly from the View/page - either using it directly like in the above code or by databinding to its properties. Does anybody know a way how this can be done?

    }
 All of the unit tests are basically a copy and past with the chages to e.property and possibly a change to one of the i numbers, the tests are designed to check edge cases cased by user input. is there something I am missing to ensure scope clears all of the variables and everything between tests. or force serial execution.

@TITLE:Using a stream to iterate n times instead of using a for loop to create n items
@CONTENT:Say I want to create n items. Pre Java 8, I would write: List<MyClass> list = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    list.add(new MyClass());
}
 Is there an elegant way to use a stream to create n items? I thought of this: List<MyClass> list = Stream.iterate(0, i -> i).limit(10)
    .map(o -> new MyClass()).collect(Collectors.toList());
 Is there a standard/better way of coding this? Note that the actual usage is a bit more complex and using a stream would be more flexible because I can immediately pump the items through other functions in one line without even creating a reference to the list, for example grouping them: Stream.iterate(0, i -> i).limit(10).map(o -> new MyClass())
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(...));
@CODE:List<MyClass> list = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    list.add(new MyClass());

@CONTENT:I have a modal and within that modal, there is a dropdown that displays large hidden content, which is working. Now when you open the next modal, stacked on top of the first modal and dismiss it, the scrolling on modal underneath becomes disabled. I have created a full example, including the steps to replicate the issue I am facing. You can see it here. <!DOCTYPE html>

 If I checked on the option. I am able to get method parameter via Parameter API. It is good. If I turn on the option, Compiler will stored method parameter information in All my compiling classes. This may make the class/jar file bigger. Eclipse turn it off by default. My question is: Is there any way to turn on the option for some class I want? Is there any compiler directive that I can add it into my java class for this purpose? Thank you!

@TITLE:Frame.Navigate to a Page-derived class in a different assembly
@CONTENT:I'd like to keep my Windows Phone 8 Blank App template based view in a different assembly than the assembly containing the application manifest and App.xaml. I keep receiving a cryptic exception which doesn't help at all in figuring out how to fix it: Create a new project from the template Visual C# > Store Apps > Windows Phone Apps > Blank App (Windows Phone). Build and deploy, works great. The properties of the MainPage.xaml state the Build Action is Page, which is correct. Create a new project based on the Class Library (Windows Phone) template from the same category within the solution containing the original project, call it MyApp.Views. Move the MainView.xaml file to the newly created project using Cut and Paste commands. Add a reference to MyApp.Views to the original project. Build, deploy, see the app start and fail to locate the view only to propagate this exception back to the developer's box: ComException: Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component. This doesn't say absolutely anything at all useful and the top stack frame is Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Frame.Navigate(Type sourcePageType, Object parameter) following the first one, which is TheOriginalProject.App.OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e). The solution is not to use NavigationService with pack URI since it seems to be absent in Windows Phone 8, or at very least the assembly containing it is not referenced by default in the Blank App template. In any event, I'd vastly prefer strongly typed view names over pack URIs. I imagine someone must've run into this issue already, what's the catch? Is there an API or a tool that will give me an insight on what the latest E_FAIL coming from COM is? Edit: When using Window.Current.Content = new MainPage() as the only content of OnLaunched, the XAML parser exception pops up. It is unable to populate an exception message, but definitely gives a better hint to what's going on. Still no solution, though, the problem only moved to the this.InitializeComponent() in the MainPage constructor. What I see now is Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.XamlParseException with WinRT information of Parser internal error: Object writer '%0' and Additional information unable to load. x:Class attribute is present at the position 128 hinted on by the exception dialog window and this thread seems relevant, but I can't work out how. Please note that I'll also find values in people confirming not receiving the error I do. If you've tried the steps to reproduce and failed to reproduce the problem, please write a comment so I can pin down what it is that causes the error I'm struggling with.

@TITLE:What is a Discriminator column in ASP.NET Migrations?
@CONTENT:I needed to add an extra field to Role identity table in ASP.NET MVC 5. I use migrations. I have added an extension to role like: public class ApplicationRole : IdentityRole
{
    public ApplicationRole() : base() { }

    public ApplicationRole(string name)
        : base(name)
    {
    }

    public virtual Project Project { get; set; }
}   
 My migration class, I'm getting is: public partial class ProjectToIdentity : DbMigration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        CreateTable(
            "dbo.Projects",
            c => new
                {
                    ID = c.Int(nullable: false, identity: true),
                    ProjectName = c.String(maxLength: 100),
                })
            .PrimaryKey(t => t.ID);

        AddColumn("dbo.AspNetRoles", "Discriminator", c => c.String(nullable: false, maxLength: 128));

@TITLE:Android Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI does not work on all devices. How to find out the correct uri for a given device?
@CONTENT:I am trying to use Android Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI to CRUD device bookmarks from within my app ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elementique.web ) It's working fine on most of the devices, but does not work on some :-( On those devices, trying to use bookmarks leads to java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown URL content://browser/bookmarks
 I now understand that Boookmark Uri can be different than the AOSP default value (i.e. "content://browser/bookmarks"). Question: How can I get the correct Bookmark Uri for a given device? I already 'collected' the following URI private static final Uri BOKKMARKS_DEFAULT = Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI; // = Uri.parse("content://browser/bookmarks")
private static final Uri BOKKMARKS_URI_CHROME = Uri.parse("content://com.android.chrome.browser/bookmarks");
private static final Uri BOKKMARKS_URI_SAMSUNG_S_ = Uri.parse("content://com.sec.android.app.sbrowser.browser/bookmarks");
 Is it a way to 'list' all available content URI (content://...) on a devices? If yes, I could list them and search for occurrence of "/bookmarks" string and give a try with this URI. Note: I am currently in the process of creating a fallback mechanism if the app is not able to get a 'working' bookmark URI (i.e. my own Bookmark DB since I do need a bookmark feature in my app)

@LINK:/questions/28037695/how-can-i-do-a-virtual-route-redirect-based-on-the-path-given-in-asp-net-vnext-m
@TITLE:How can I do a virtual route/redirect based on the path given in ASP.NET VNEXT MVC6?
@CONTENT:I have a website that exposes several APIs at different paths, each handled by a controller specific to a section of the application, like example.com/Api/Controller/Action?param1=stuff, where Controller changes, but Actions remain fairly consistent. I have several integrated devices that call these APIs. The issue is that these integrated devices cannot be changed easily, and the specific controller I want them to point to will need to change in the future. My plan is to use something like a virtual redirect, where all the devices would call a fixed URL like example.com/Api/VRedirect/{deviceId}/MethodName?param1=test Depending on the value of deviceId, the actual Controller that is used would change (based on some database lookup logic). So for example, if the deviceId 1234 gets looked up and returns "Example", calling example.com/Api/VRedirect/1234/Test?param1=test would be the equivalent of calling example.com/Api/Example/Test?param1=test directly. So far I have found no way of implementing this properly, the only way I have come close is by using custom routing: app.UseMvc(routes => {
    routes.MapRoute(
                    name: "RedirectRoute",
                    template: "Api/VRedirect/{deviceId}/{*subAction}",
                    defaults: new { controller = "BaseApi", action = "VRedirect"});
);
 with a redirect action: public IActionResult VRedirect(string deviceId, string subAction) {
        string controllerName = "Example"; // Database lookup based off deviceId
        return Redirect(string.Format("/Api/{0}/{1}", controllerName, subAction));
    }
 This partially works for GET requests, but doesn't work at all for POST because it discards any and all POST data. Is there any way to implement something like this? I suspect I might have to write a custom router but I'm not sure where to start. Update: I have managed to accomplish the desired behaviour using the default router by simply adding a route for each device in a loop: app.UseMvc(routes => {
    Dictionary<string, string> deviceRouteAssignments = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    // TODO: Get all these assignments from a database
    deviceRouteAssignments.Add("12345", "ExampleControllerName");
    foreach (var thisAssignment in deviceRouteAssignments) {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "DeviceRouteAssignment_" + thisAssignment.Key,
            template: "Api/VRedirect/" + thisAssignment.Key + "/{action}",
            defaults: new { controller = thisAssignment.Value });
        }
    }
}
 However this has a few obvious limitations, such as the routes only being updated upon application startup. Performance degradation for a huge number of routes may be an issue, however I've tested 10,000 routes didn't notice any perceivable slowdown.
@CODE:example.com/Api/Controller/Action?param1=stuff example.com/Api/VRedirect/{deviceId}/MethodName?param1=test deviceId deviceId example.com/Api/VRedirect/1234/Test?param1=test example.com/Api/Example/Test?param1=test app.UseMvc(routes => {
    routes.MapRoute(
                    name: "RedirectRoute",
                    template: "Api/VRedirect/{deviceId}/{*subAction}",
                    defaults: new { controller = "BaseApi", action = "VRedirect"});
); public IActionResult VRedirect(string deviceId, string subAction) {
        string controllerName = "Example"; // Database lookup based off deviceId
        return Redirect(string.Format("/Api/{0}/{1}", controllerName, subAction));
    } app.UseMvc(routes => {
    Dictionary<string, string> deviceRouteAssignments = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    // TODO: Get all these assignments from a database
    deviceRouteAssignments.Add("12345", "ExampleControllerName");
    foreach (var thisAssignment in deviceRouteAssignments) {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "DeviceRouteAssignment_" + thisAssignment.Key,
            template: "Api/VRedirect/" + thisAssignment.Key + "/{action}",
            defaults: new { controller = thisAssignment.Value });
        }
    }
}

@TITLE:IndexError: too many indices for array
@CONTENT:I know there is a ton of these threads but all of them are for very simple cases like 3x3 matrices and things of that sort and the solutions do not even begin to apply to my situation. So I'm trying to graph G versus l1 (that's not an eleven, but an L1). The data is in the file that I loaded from an excel file. The excel file is 14x250 so there are 14 arguments, each with 250 data points. I had another user (shout out to Hugh Bothwell!) help me with an error in my code, but now another error has surfaced. So here is the code in question: # format for CSV file:
header = ['l1', 'l2', 'l3', 'l4', 'l5', 'EI',
      'S', 'P_right', 'P1_0', 'P3_0',
      'w_left', 'w_right', 'G_left', 'G_right']

def loadfile(filename, skip=None, *args):
    skip = set(skip or [])
    with open(filename, *args) as f:
        cr = csv.reader(f, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
        return np.array(row for i,row in enumerate(cr) if i not in skip)
#plot data
outputs_l1 = [loadfile('C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Work\\Python Stuff\\BPCROOM - Shingles analysis\\ERR analysis\\l_1 analysis//BS(1) ERR analysis - l_1 - P_3 = {}.csv'.format(p)) for p in p3_arr]

col = {name:i for i,name in enumerate(header)}

fig = plt.figure()
for data,color in zip(outputs_l1, colors):
    xs  = data[:, col["l1"     ]]
    gl = data[:, col["G_left" ]] * 1000.0    # column 12
    gr = data[:, col["G_right"]] * 1000.0    # column 13
    plt.plot(xs, gl, color + "-", gr, color + "--")
for output, col in zip(outputs_l1, colors):
    plt.plot(output[:,0], output[:,11]*1E3, col+'--')
plt.ticklabel_format(axis='both', style='plain', scilimits=(-1,1))
plt.xlabel('$l1 (m)$')
plt.ylabel('G $(J / m^2) * 10^{-3}$')
plt.xlim(xmin=.2)
plt.ylim(ymax=2, ymin=0)

plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.8, bottom=0.15, right=0.7)
 After running the entire program, I recieve the error message: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/Chris/Desktop/Work/Python Stuff/New Stuff from Brenday 8 26 2014/CD_ssa_plot(2).py", line 115, in <module>
    xs  = data[:, col["l1"     ]]
IndexError: too many indices for array
 and before I ran into that problem, I had another involving the line a few below the one the above error message refers to: Traceback (most recent call last): File "FILE", line 119, in <module> 
gl = data[:, col["G_left" ]] * 1000.0 # column 12 
IndexError: index 12 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 12
 I understand the first error, but am just having problems fixing it. The second error is confusing for me though. My boss is really breathing down my neck so any help would be GREATLY appreciated!

 About my class of Test is like this : import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mockito.ArgumentCaptor;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import fr.aop.subscription.AbstractSubscription;
public class SubscriptionTest extends TestCase {
@Test
public void testGetSubscriptionById() {
    ArgumentCaptor<AbstractSubscription> 
arg=ArgumentCaptor.forClass(AbstractSubscription.class);        
     Subscription objMock=Mockito.mock(Subscription.class);        
    Mockito.when(objMock.getSubscribById(1)).thenReturn(arg.getValue());
}
}
 And about the method getSubscribById whitch is in the class Subscription: @Override
public AbstractSubscription getSubscriptionById(final Integer id) {
    this.log.debug("BEGIN: getSubscriptionById id = " + id);
    AbstractSubscription obj = null;
    if (id != null) {
        final StringBuilder queryString = new StringBuilder("select c from AbstractSubscription c ");

        try {
            queryString.append("where c.id = :id");
            Query query = this.getEntityManager().createQuery(queryString.toString());
            query = query.setParameter("id", id);
            obj = (AbstractSubscription) query.getSingleResult();
        } catch (final Exception exc) {

        }
    }
    return obj;
}
 when I instanciate the Subcription class it demand me the connection to the database, that's why I want to escape this and looking for a solution like mockito

@TITLE:Upload a file to Amazon S3 with NodeJS
@CONTENT:I ran into a problem while trying to upload a file to my S3 bucket. Everything works except that my file paramters do not seem appropriate. I am using Amazon S3 sdk to upload from nodejs to s3. These are my routes settings: var multiparty = require('connect-multiparty'),
    multipartyMiddleware = multiparty();
app.route('/api/items/upload').post(multipartyMiddleware, items.upload);
 This is items.upload() function: exports.upload = function(req, res) {

    var s3bucket = new AWS.S3({params: {Bucket: 'mybucketname'}});
    s3bucket.createBucket(function() {

        s3bucket.upload(params, function(err, data) {

 Setting Body param to a string like "hello" works fine. According to doc, Body param must take (Buffer, Typed Array, Blob, String, ReadableStream) Object data. However, uploading a file object fails with the following error message: [Error: Unsupported body payload object]
 This is the file object: { fieldName: 'file',

@CONTENT:I have a google chrome extension that crashes after you install it from the webstore. When installed from a local copy the extension does not crash. The crash happens when you click the tool bar icon that is added once it has been installed. The icon is supposed to load a table with URLs. Once restarted all you get is the option to recover tabs. I was hoping someone could help identify the issue of the crash or tell me how to access a crash report to see what is causing the problem. The extension is located here: Chrome Store App Any help or direction will be very appreciated. Thank you

@TITLE:How to make a container fill whole screen below the navigation bar in Ionic?
@CONTENT:I want an iframe to fill all the space below the navigation bar. I see that Ionic is generating inline CSS and adding classes to html, body tags and it also creates div wrappers. I don't know what is the intended way to achieve what I want. Do I need to use some pre-made CSS class for this, or write my own? If so, how should I do that, to not break the layout. The question is not really about iframe, it is about getting a container fill the whole space below the navigation bar. At the moment iframe takes full width but only 150 pixels of height, because the parent container has 150px height. My application is based on the (tabs application from github). My code is below: index.html: <!DOCTYPE html>

@LINK:/questions/27967195/boost-spirit-parsing-csv-with-columns-in-variable-order
@TITLE:boost spirit parsing CSV with columns in variable order
@CONTENT:I'm trying to parse a CSV file (with header line) using boost spirit. The csv is not in a constant format. Sometimes there is some extra column or the order of the column is mixed. I'm interested in few columns, whose header name is well known. For instance my CSV may look like: 
Name,Surname,Age
John,Doe,32
 Or: 
Age,Name
32,John
 I want to parse only the content of Name and Age (N.B. Age is integer type). At the moment i come out with a very ugly solution where Spirit parses the first line and creates a vector that contains an enum in the positions i'm interested into. And then i have to do the parsing of the terminal symbols by hand... enum LineItems {
    NAME, AGE, UNUSED
};

struct CsvLine {
    string name;
    int age;
};

using Column = std::string;
using CsvFile = std::vector<CsvLine>;

template<typename It>
struct CsvGrammar: qi::grammar<It, CsvFile(), qi::locals<std::vector<LineItems>>, qi::blank_type> {
    CsvGrammar() :
            CsvGrammar::base_type(start) {
        using namespace qi;

        static const char colsep = ',';

        start = qi::omit[header[qi::_a = qi::_1]] >> eol >> line(_a) % eol;
        header = (lit("Name")[phx::push_back(phx::ref(qi::_val), LineItems::NAME)]
                | lit("Age")[phx::push_back(phx::ref(qi::_val), LineItems::AGE)]
                | column[phx::push_back(phx::ref(qi::_val), LineItems::UNUSED)]) % colsep;
        line = (column % colsep)[phx::bind(&CsvGrammar<It>::convertFunc, this, qi::_1, qi::_r1,
                qi::_val)];
        column = quoted | *~char_(",\n");
        quoted = '"' >> *("\"\"" | ~char_("\"\n")) >> '"';
    }

    void convertFunc(std::vector<string>& columns, std::vector<LineItems>& positions, CsvLine &csvLine) {
       //terminal symbol parsing here, and assign to csvLine struct.
       ...
    }
private:
    qi::rule<It, CsvFile(), qi::locals<std::vector<LineItems>>, qi::blank_type> start;
    qi::rule<It, std::vector<LineItems>(), qi::blank_type> header;
    qi::rule<It, CsvLine(std::vector<LineItems>), qi::blank_type> line;
    qi::rule<It, Column(), qi::blank_type> column;
    qi::rule<It, std::string()> quoted;
    qi::rule<It, qi::blank_type> empty;

};
 Here is the full source. What if the header parser could prepare a vector<rule<...>*> and the "line parser" just use this vector to parse itself? a sort of advanced nabialek trick (i've been trying but i couldn't make it). Or is there any better way to parse this kind of CSV with Spirit? (any help is appreciated, thank you in advance)

@TITLE:Clear memory allocated by plotting in IPython
@CONTENT:I'm plotting some large plots in IPython QtConsole (and Notebook). These take up a lot of memory, but once they are plotted I don't need them any more and they can go. How can I free up memory? None of the following works: close()
clf()
cla()
%reset
 The only thing that frees the memory is restarting the kernel, which I don't always want to do (say I worked through a long process to get to a specific point) [To be precise, %reset does free up some memory, but not as much as restarting the kernel]. How to replicate the problem: plot(arange(2e7))
 You may need a bigger or a smaller number to notice a big impact on your system memory.

@TITLE:How to create a form with multiple rows of one entity in Symfony2
@CONTENT:First I've read documents for both Collection Field Type and How to Embed a Collection of Forms ... The example is about one entity (Task) that has one-to-many relation with another entity (Tag), and I understand it, but I can not adapt it to what I want! To make it simpler, let say I have a Task entity, this task entity has some relations with other objects like user and project (each task can have one user and one project) I want to make one form, inside this form a list of Tasks, each task in one row of a table that shows information like task.title, task.startdate, task.user.name, task.user.company.name, task.project.name, And it has 2 fields editable, textbox "Description" and checkbox "active". You can edit multiple tasks and submit the form using one button at the bottom of the table in the main form, so basically you should be able to update multiple records in one transaction (instead of making one form and one submit button per row and therefor one record update per submit). I have many issues with this complicated design: First I wanted to follow the sample to embed a collection of forms inside the main form, So I made a Form Type for my Task that should be like one form per row. I made these files: Form Type for Task: // src/Acme/TaskBundle/Form/Type/TaskType.php

 BUT there is an issue here, when I get the result from query builder it is a mess of arrays containing objects in them, I get an error about The form's view data is expected to be an instance of class Acme\TaskBundle\Entity\Task, but is a(n) array. You can avoid this error by setting the "data_class" option to null or by adding a view transformer that transforms a(n) array to an instance of Acme\TaskBundle\Entity\Task. This is the query: createQueryBuilder()
    ->select(
            "
            task.id,
            task.title,
            task.startDate,
            task.description,
            user.name as userName,
            company.name as companyName,
            project.name as projectName,
            "
    )
        ->from('Acme\TaskBundle\Entity\Task', 'task')
        ->innerJoin('task.project', 'project')
        ->innerJoin('task.user', 'user')
        ->innerJoin('Acme\TaskBundle\Entity\Company', 'company', 'with', 'store.company = company')
        ->where('task.active = :isActive')->setParameter('isActive', true);
 Soooo, I used Partial Objects guide to see if it can help, it helps to make the task object in the query result and I could extract it and send it to form, but still it seems the rest of form is unaware of the rest of objects... Ok, so maybe I'm choosing the wrong approach, I'm not sure! please if you have any suggestions about what should I do, put a note here... I'm struggling with this for more than a week! Thanks in advance for your time! Even if you don't put any note, I appreciate that you spend time reading my very long question! Thanks! :)

@TITLE:Unable to sign app bundle using Qt frameworks on OS X 10.10
@CONTENT:I am having trouble signing Qt Based application un OS X. I am using Qt 5.3.2. I have read various information source that contain contradictory information. Here is the content of my application bundle after I run the bin/macdeployqt Qt utility SimpleHello.app/
    Contents/
        Info.plist
        PkgInfo
        Frameworks/
            QtCore.framework/
                Resources/
                Versions/
                    5/
                        QtCore
            QtGui.framework/  ... same as Qt core
            QtPrintSupport.framework/  ... same as Qt core
            QtWidgets.framework/  ... same as Qt core
        MacOS/
            SimpleHello
        PlugIns/ ... some plugins
        Resources/
            empty.lproj
            qt.conf
 First: I tried: http://successfulsoftware.net/2012/08/30/how-to-sign-your-mac-os-x-app-for-gatekeeper/ However, it seems that it is not valid anymore in OS X 10.10 Yosemite Second: I tried: Sign a Framework for OSX 10.9 I was able to sign the whole application without any error. However, when running spctl to verify the validity of the application, I get spctl -a -vvvv SimpleHello.app
SimpleHello.app/: rejected
source=obsolete resource envelope
origin=Developer ID Application: MY CERTIFICATE
 Additionally when verifying signature with codesign, I get this: codesign --verify --deep --verbose=4 SimpleHello.app
--prepared:/My/Path/SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtCore.framework
--validated:/My/Path/SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtCore.framework
SimpleHello.app/: embedded framework contains modified or invalid version
In subcomponent: /My/Path/SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtCore.framework
 Third: Added the --no-strict option in codesign verification according to: Error when export archive It fixes the issue with codesign verification but does not fix the spctl issue. Forth: I tried adding the --no-legacy-signing option when signing frameworks. However I get this error when verifying the bundle signature (both with codesign and spctl codesign --verify --deep --verbose=4 SimpleHello.app
SimpleHello.app/: code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present
 Fifth: Modified the framework structure according to: http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/47768 and https://gist.github.com/kingcheez/6154462d7734e0c0f3a4 In this case I get this error when trying to sign frameworks SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtCore.framework: unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded framework
SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework: unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded framework
SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtPrintSupport.framework: unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded framework
SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtWidgets.framework: unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded framework
 EDIT: It seems that the issue with the unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded framework was because one of the simlink was malformed. It was: QtCore.framework.framework/Versions/Current -> 5/
 Instead of QtCore.framework.framework/Versions/Current -> 5
 After this fix, I still get the same result as in Sixth though. Sixth: Added the --no-strict option when calling codesign for Frameworks. I was able to sign all frameworks except for one SimpleHello.app//Contents/Frameworks/QtCore.framework: signed bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64) [.]
SimpleHello.app//Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework: signed bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64) [.]
SimpleHello.app//Contents/Frameworks/QtPrintSupport.framework: code object is not signed at all
In subcomponent: /My/Path/SimpleHello.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtPrintSupport.framework/Versions/Current/QtPrintSupport
SimpleHello.app//Contents/Frameworks/QtWidgets.framework: signed bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64) [.]
 Seventh: I posted this question since I don't know what to look for anymore

 If I click on Prof.A, I get my next html page. My problem is that I can click on Prof.A even when I haven't zoomed in on this bubble. I just want to be able to click on it when I have zoomed on it and the label is readable. I tried to "fix" the zoom functions, but nothing seems to work. zoom.html: <!DOCTYPE html>

@TITLE:Reactivity in R shiny with toy example
@CONTENT:I am altering this example (https://gist.github.com/wch/5436415/). Below is a toy model. Bascially I need the selectInput to be reactive and each time the selectInput is changed the value selected is passes to a function in global.r. Then I need to be able to use the result. Basically: (1) When the app first appears there should be 1 plot (2) When the user changes the slider input there is a reactive "input$n" in the max_plots function in server.r. This input$n is passed to the "NumberOfPlots" function in global.r (3) "numberOfPlots" will return a number. Ex. If the user changes the select input to 5. 5 gets passed to "NumberOfPlots" and 5 is returned from "NumberOfPlots" (4) now that the user made his selection I am using "maxplots()" in the shiny server function to access the number of plots I am getting the error: Error in .getReactiveEnvironment()$currentContext() : 
  Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)

@LINK:/questions/27929830/using-nsurlconnection-with-a-valid-ssl-certificate-in-swift
@TITLE:Using NSURLConnection with a valid SSL certificate in Swift
@CONTENT:I am relatively new to IOS development. So please bear with me and forgive anything noddy! I am trying to get data back from a SOAP web service using NSURLConnection, and it's working fine. However, as soon as I change the URL from http to https then I do not get any data back anymore and I do not get an error or anything like I would expect. The https certificate is a valid certificate from godaddy and it setup correctly and views correctly on all browsers etc fine, so basically can anyone point me in the right direction as to why nothing happens when changing from http to https...... The code is in Swift and is as follows:     // Create the SOAP Message to send
    var soapMessage = "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' xmlns:ns1='http://tempuri.org/'><SOAP-ENV:Body><ns1:get_Test/></SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>"

    NSLog("soapMessage generated is: %@", soapMessage)

    // Soap URL Works
    var urlString = "http://api.domain.com/testservice.svc"

    //Below https URL does not work
    //var urlString = "https://api.domain.com/testservice.svc"

    var url = NSURL(string: urlString)
    var theRequest = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: url!)

    //Get Length of request
    var msgLength = String(countElements(soapMessage))

    // POST Header values
    theRequest.addValue("text/xml; charset=utf-8", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    theRequest.addValue(msgLength, forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Length")
    theRequest.addValue("http://tempuri.org/IService/get_Test", forHTTPHeaderField: "SoapAction")
    theRequest.HTTPMethod = "POST"
    theRequest.HTTPBody = soapMessage.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding, allowLossyConversion: false)
    NSLog("Request is: %@", theRequest.allHTTPHeaderFields!)

    var connection = NSURLConnection(request: theRequest, delegate: self, startImmediately: true)
    connection?.start()

    if (connection == true) {
        var mutableData : Void = NSMutableData.initialize()
    }
 Further NSURLConnection code is: // NSURLConnectionDelegate
func connection(connection: NSURLConnection!, didReceiveResponse response: NSURLResponse!) {
    mutableData.length = 0;
}

func connection(connection: NSURLConnection!, didReceiveData data: NSData!) {
    mutableData.appendData(data)
}


func connection(connection: NSURLConnection, didFailWithError error: NSError) {
    NSLog("Error with Soap call: %@", error)
}

func connectionDidFinishLoading(connection: NSURLConnection!) {
    var xmlParser = NSXMLParser(data: mutableData)
    xmlParser.delegate = self
    xmlParser.parse()
    xmlParser.shouldResolveExternalEntities = true
}
// NSURLConnectionDelegate
 Then I have my parser stuff, like didStartElement, didEndElement, foundCharacters, parserDidEndDocument etc. I have also added some further delegates of NSURLConnection as below, but nothing has changed. They are being called as the logging is showing up.  func connection(connection: NSURLConnection, canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace protectionSpace: NSURLProtectionSpace?) -> Bool
{
     NSLog("am here")
    return protectionSpace?.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust
}

func connection(connection: NSURLConnection, didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge challenge: NSURLAuthenticationChallenge?)
{
     NSLog("am here 2")
    if challenge?.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust
    {
        if challenge?.protectionSpace.host == "api.domain.com"
        {
            NSLog("yep")
            let credentials = NSURLCredential(forTrust: challenge!.protectionSpace.serverTrust)
            challenge!.sender.useCredential(credentials, forAuthenticationChallenge: challenge!)
        }
    }
    challenge?.sender.continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge(challenge!)
}
 it runs through the code gets to the "yep" and so from what I understand should trust the certificate, but still nothing displays when I use the https url. So there is no difference between any of the code apart from the https, and the certificate is properly valid, so how can I get data back using https rather than http? Many thanks - and sorry if this is a dumb question! Dave Additional: ok I have changed the connection now to:     var connection = NSURLConnection(request: theRequest, delegate: self, startImmediately: false)
    connection?.start()

    if (connection == true) {
        var mutableData : Void = NSMutableData.initialize()
    } else {
        NSLog("Error with connection, details: %@", connection!)
    }
 So this now logs "Error with connection" when I run it with SSL! So then I have changed didreceiveresponse to: func connection(connection: NSURLConnection!, didReceiveResponse response: NSURLResponse!) {
    mutableData.length = 0;
    var httpresponse = response as? NSHTTPURLResponse
    println("status \(httpresponse?.statusCode)")
    println("headers \(httpresponse?.allHeaderFields)")
}
 and I see that the statuscode back is a 404 - which I just don't understand as the web service is clearly there, and can be parsed using online parsers! So still stuck but at least it's pointing to the issue. Anyone have any thoughts to help me further?

@CONTENT:This may be a duplicate question but there is one thing I need to know and I wasn't able to find it on any other questions. How can I pop up an alert box when the browser's refresh of back button is clicked but not any other buttons like homepage, etc. that refirects the page to another page? I was able to make an alert box using this code: <script type="text/javascript">
    window.onbeforeunload = function() {
        return 'If you resubmit this page, progress will be lost.';
    };
</script>
 But when I click on my homepage button, which loads the page to another page, the alert box still triggers. I need the alert box only for the refresh and back button of the BROWSER. Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance. :) UPDATE This is the code that works with jsfiddle.net but not with my browser. <html>
<head>
<script>
    var btn = document.getElementById('homepage'),
    clicked = false;

    btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
    clicked = true;
    });

    window.onbeforeunload = function () {
    if(!clicked) {

@CONTENT:I have a 15GB file with more than 25 milion rows, which is in this json format(which is accepted by mongodb for importing: [
    {"_id": 1, "value": "\u041c\..."}
    {"_id": 2, "value": "\u041d\..."}

 When I'm trying to import it in mongodb with the following command I get speed of only 50 rows per second which is really slow for me. mongoimport --db wordbase --collection sentences --type json --file C:\Users\Aleksandar\PycharmProjects\NLPSeminarska\my_file.json -jsonArray
 When I tried to insert the data into the collection by using python with pymongo the speed was even worse. I also tried increasing the priority of the process but it didn't make any difference. The next thing that I tried is the same thing but without using -jsonArray and although I got a big speed increase(~4000/sec), it said that the BSON representation of the supplied JSON is too large. I also tried splitting the file into 5 separate files and importing them from separate consoles into the same collection, but I get speed decrease of all of them to about 20 documents/sec. While I searched all over the web I saw that people had speeds of over 8K documents/sec and I can't see what do I do wrong. Is there a way to speed this thing up, or should I convert the whole json file to bson and import it that way, and if so which is the correct way to do both the converting and the importing? Huge thanks.

@LINK:/questions/27877612/firebase-no-index-defined

@CONTENT:I'm using Firebase to retrieve some data of Users. I need to retrieve only one User with (gameSearching = true). My data looks like: Users

|
|_____ Barbara
         |___ name: Barbara Smith
         |___ gameSearching: true
 I'm running this code: setData(('Users/' + you + '/'), {gameSearching: true});

var ref = new Firebase("https://grootproject.firebaseio.com/Users");
var child = ref.orderByChild("gameSearching");
child.on("child_added", function (data) {
    var yourself = firebase.getAuth().password.email.split("@", 1)[0];
    data.forEach(
        function (childSnapshot) {
            if (childSnapshot[i].val().gameSearching == true && childSnapshot[i].key() != yourself) {

                setData(('Users/' + yourself + '/'), {gameSearching: false});
            }
        }
    );


});
 Because 'data' has multiple values, I use 'data.forEach' to separate them. After that point I can set a 'return' on 'true' so I only will recieve one User with 'gameSearching: true'. My firebase rules: {
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
    ".indexOn": "gameSearching"
  }
}
 When I run this code I get the following error: 'Uncaught Error: No index defined for gameSearching' I have searched for setting a index on 'gameSearching' using '.indexOn' but not with any succes. https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/guide/indexing-data.html Does anyone have a example or a solution?

    ref.orderByChild("gameSearching").equalTo(true).limitToFirst(1).on("child_added", function (data) {
        var yourself = firebase.getAuth().password.email.split("@", 1)[0];

            var opponent = data.key();
            console.log(opponent);

            setData(('Users/' + opponent + '/'), {gameSearching: false});
            setData(('Users/' + yourself + '/'), {gameSearching: false});
            console.log('ja');
    });
 I edited my rules of my firebase: {
"rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
    "Users": {
  ".indexOn": "gameSearching"
}
}
 } The indexOn error wont show anymore, so that's great. But ref.orderByChild("gameSearching").equalTo(true).limitToFirst(1) will runs twice. I don't know how that's possible. I'm using limitToFirst(1)`, so I expect 1 child?

@TITLE:Why is the Copy trait needed for default (struct valued) array initialization?
@CONTENT:When I define a struct like this: struct MyType {
    member: u16
}
 I can pass it to a function by value without adding anything specific: fn my_function(param: MyType) {
    println!("param.member: {}", param.member);
}
 However when I want to create an array of MyType instances with a default value fn main() {
    let array = [MyType { member: 1234 }; 100];
    println!("array[42].member: ", array[42].member);
}
 The Rust compiler tells me: test.rs:17:14: 17:43 error: the trait `core::marker::Copy` is not implemented
for the type `MyType`
test.rs:17  let array = [MyType { member: 1234 }; 100];
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
 When I specify impl Copy for MyType { }
 everything works. Questions: Why do I need to specify an empty Copy trait implementation? Is there a simpler way to do this or do I have to re-think something (I'm coming from C)? Why does it work when passing an instance of MyType to the function by value? My guess is that it is being moved, so there is no copy in the first place. I am using Rust 1.0.0-nightly as of today.
@CODE:struct MyType {
    member: u16

 I expected the mocked Dispatcher to register the callbacks since that happens in the actual item_store file, which I have told jest to not mock. However, since ShopDispatcher.register is undefined, it's not being registered, but I am not quite sure why. Any help is appreciated.

@TITLE:How to make an application crash when a Task throws an exception without waiting the finalizer
@CONTENT:We are using Tasks in our .Net 4 (no async await available) application and sometimes they are used to launch 'Fire and Forget' operations like the following one: private void Test()
{
    Task task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
    {
        throw new ApplicationException("Test");
    });
}
 We want this exception to crash the application without waiting the task (as otherwise it makes no sense to have it in a task, at least in our scenarios) and without waiting the finalizer as we want to shutdown the application when an unexpected error happens to avoid state corruptions (we are saving the state present when the exception happened). My guess is that somehow we should work with a continuation task but that puts the continuation code inside another task that will not make the application crash so I'm blocked here. Any help will be very appreciated Edit: if switching to the ThreadPool the result is the expected one. The following code crashes the application: ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem((c) =>
{
    throw new ApplicationException("Test");
});

In my case, ShipmentCode is not Primary Key of Shipment table, and lazy-loading is not used by Hibernate. Could you show me how to accomplish that goal?

@TITLE:Heroku Schema load: Permission denied for database ¡§postgres¡¨ User
@CONTENT:I'm trying to deploy my Rails app to Heroku, and I now want to load my schema. I get the following error: Running `bundle exec rake db:schema:load` attached to terminal... up, run.1533
rake aborted!
PG::ConnectionBad: FATAL:  permission denied for database "postgres"
DETAIL:  User does not have CONNECT privilege.
 Which is weird because postgres is not the database it should connect to. The database URL, which is available to the app via ENV, has the right values, and the long apparently random name d3kwlkwlwjwljetc.... Searching for this message gives me people who are trying to drop or reset the DB, which is not what I'm doing. I have 0 rows I tried pg:reset, even removed and put back the database. No avail. I'm not doing db:drop, just db:schema:load I'm dumbfounded. Why can't my app connect? Edit: Apparently, I can't schema:load, but I can migrate all my migrations over. Why is that?

@CONTENT:I try to make a simple web application. There will be very few users(one or two). No need to make complicated membership stuff. I need just basic login process. I use Visual Studio 2013 I made some research on the internet and found something about ASP.NET Identity. However i could not found anything about how to install Identity tables to my own mssql database. I used ASP.NET membership before and it was easy to install tables by using aspnet_regsql.exe and adding some codes to web.config But now i am really confused with Identity stuff. It uses a default database to store users. But in my server there will be my sql database that stores both my datas and user datas. How can i combine these two databases into one? How can I install Identity tables to my own database and configure my Project to use it?

@TITLE:Unit testing with Bookshelf.js and knex.js
@CONTENT:I'm relatively new to Node and am working on a project using knex and bookshelf. I'm having a little bit of trouble unit testing my code and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Basically I have a model (called VorcuProduct) that looks like this: var VorcuProduct = bs.Model.extend({
    tableName: 'vorcu_products'
});

module.exports.VorcuProduct = VorcuProduct
 And a function that saves a VorcuProduct if it does not exist on the DB. Quite simple. The function doing this looks like this: function subscribeToUpdates(productInformation, callback) {
  model.VorcuProduct
    .where({product_id: productInformation.product_id, store_id: productInformation.store_id})
    .fetch()
    .then(function(existing_model) {
        if (existing_model == undefined) {
            new model.VorcuProduct(productInformation)
                .save()
                .then(function(new_model) { callback(null, new_model)})
                .catch(callback);
        } else {
            callback(null, existing_model)
        }
    })
}
 Which is the correct way to test this without hitting the DB? Do I need to mock fetch to return a model or undefined (depending on the test) and then do the same with save? Should I use rewire for this? As you can see I'm a little bit lost, so any help will be appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:Floating Action Button appears over Navigation Drawer
@CONTENT:So I am using https://github.com/neokree/MaterialNavigationDrawer for my navigation drawer and https://gist.github.com/Jogan/9def6110edf3247825c9 as my FAB implementation. When I open the navigation drawer, it does not cover the FAB, and the button appears on top of it. I would like to avoid hiding the button and showing it on drawer open/close as that is rather distracting. Any ideas on how to fix this? Edit: I am adding the FAB programmatically doing the following: fabButton = new FloatingActionButton.Builder(this)
            .withDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.ic_action_edit))
            .withButtonColor(0xFF2196F3)
            .withGravity(Gravity.BOTTOM | Gravity.END)
            .withMargins(0, 0, 16, 16)
            .create();
 Changing that declaration to the fragment does not fix it. The Nav Bar implementation I linked above requires the activity to extend from a MaterialNavigationDrawer class, which may draw the Nav Drawer first, leaving the button to always be last. Is there any way to programmatically force the ordering of the elements?
@CODE:fabButton = new FloatingActionButton.Builder(this)
            .withDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.ic_action_edit))

@TITLE:Hide inputAccessoryView if hardware keyboard is connected
@CONTENT:Similar to this question: iPad: Detecting External Keyboard, I am developing an iPad app that is using text fields with a custom inputAccessoryView to provide additional functionality for the virtual keyboard. However, if a hardware keyboard (e.g. bluetooth keyboard) is connected to the device, the software keyboard is not shown as expected, but for some reason the inputAccessoryView is still visible at the bottom of the screen. Additionally, this seems to cause firing the UIKeyboardDidShowNotification(and therefore moving my view up to avoid occlusion by the keyboard which is actually not present) even if the hardware keyboard is used for input. I found several solutions to detect if a hardware keyboard is connected, but all of them check the state after receiving a UIKeyboardDidShowNotification, at which point the inputAccessoryView is already visible (e.g. How can I detect if an external keyboard is present on an iPad?). I am looking for a way to only show a inputAccessoryView if there is no hardware keyboard connected. Therefore I need to know if a hardware keyboard is connected before a UIKeyboardDidShowNotification is fired. The accepted solutions provided here How can I detect if an external keyboard is present on an iPad? are no option for me as they use private APIs which may cause my app to get rejected.

 The migration is just the result of running 'makemigration' from the shell, no custom code. I do see accounts listed in the included applications, but the migration isn't being ran, so my site is in an odd spot where Django says the table is missing when I try to use it, but Django says it exists when I try to run the migration to create it. Why does Django erroneously think that the table already exists when I can look at the database and see that it doesn't?

@TITLE:How to use Graph Cuts for segmenting objects in grayscale 2D images?
@CONTENT:I need to extract out some unwanted objects from chest x-ray images using Shai Bagon's Matlab Wrapper for Graph Cuts suggested by @rayryeng in this post. I've read the paper by Boykov and got some idea of how Graph Cuts work. I've also downloaded the Shai Bagon's Matlab Warpper for Graph Cuts and compiled the required mex files. To get started, I downloaded the simple example of image segmentation. But, I'm confused of how I could use [gch ...] = GraphCut(mode, ...);
 for segmenting the unwanted objects in grayscale 2D images. Any help is appreciated as always. Thanks.
@CODE:[gch ...] = GraphCut(mode, ...); im = cat(3, im, im, im); Dc

 I see what is returned is var yo = func(strings, raw, x, y, x + y); I understand the basics about the string literals and the x y values being inserted. What I don't understand is...when is strings used versus when is raw used? Since the function has both arrays and the user doesn't have control to tell the function when to use raw and when to use cooked(strings).

@TITLE:Hystrix ignores timeout on run
@CONTENT:I'm experimenting with Hystrix a little. I under stand the documentation such that even a synchronous call to a Hystrix command via 'run' runs by default in a thread and should be subject to the timeout configured in Hystrix. But when I try it, no timeout seems to happen. Do I misinterpret the documentation? Or am I doing something wrong? And is there a way to get the timeout behavior with synchronous calls? More specific: I have a 'SimpleService' that takes 5 seconds to return. This is wrapped in a Hystrix command with a timeout of 500ms: public class WebRequestCommand extends HystrixCommand<String> {
    private final SimpleService baneService;

    protected WebRequestCommand(SimpleService baneService) {

        super(
                Setter.withGroupKey(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey("test"))
                        .andCommandPropertiesDefaults(
                                HystrixCommandProperties.Setter()
                                        .withExecutionIsolationThreadTimeoutInMilliseconds(500)));
        this.baneService = baneService;
    }

    @Override
    protected String run() {
        return baneService.connectToBane();

    }

    @Override
    protected String getFallback() {
       return "SERVICE NOT AVAILABLE";
    }
}
 If I call it like this: WebRequestCommand webService = new WebRequestCommand(baneService);
result = webService.run();
 I get the result after 5 Seconds => No timeout If I call it like this: WebRequestCommand webService = new WebRequestCommand(baneService);
result = webService.queue().get();
 Hystrix timeout happens after 500ms and returns the fallback.
@CODE:public class WebRequestCommand extends HystrixCommand<String> {
    private final SimpleService baneService;

    protected WebRequestCommand(SimpleService baneService) {

        super(
                Setter.withGroupKey(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey("test"))

@LINK:/questions/27776672/spring-protype-scope-behaviour
@TITLE:Spring Protype Scope Behaviour
@CONTENT:As far as I read from spring documentation, if I put a prototype scoped bean inside a larger scoped bean, prototype scoped bean acts like as if it is also a view scoped bean. Meaning, it will only be initialized when the container bean is initialized. In my prototype scoped bean, I have a simple property and a getter setter for that. @Repository
@Transactional( readonly=true )
@MyPrototypeScope // see definition of this one at [1]
class MyPrototypeScopedBean {
    protected String member ;
    public String getMember( ) { return this.member ; }
    public void setMember( String member ) { 
        this.member = member ; 
        System.err.println( "member is set to " + this.member + ", class is : " 
                             + this.getClass( ).getName( ) ) ;
    }

    protected void someMethod( ) {
        System.err.println( "The member is " + member + ", class is : " 
                             + this.getClass( ).getName( ) ) ;
    }
}
 My view scoped bean autowires it and tries to use it. class MyViewScopedBean {
    @Autowired
    MyPrototypeScopedBean proto ;
....
    public void problematicMethod( ) {
        MyPrototypeScopedBean tmpReference = this.proto ; // to be sure we access it only once

        tmpReference.setMember( "X" ) ;

        System.err.println( "Value of member is " + tmpReference.getMember( ) + ", class is : " 
                             + this.getClass( ).getName( ) ) ;
        this.proto.someMethod( ) ;
    }
}
 In the above case, I expect to see an output like below: member is set to X, class is : com.xxx.MyPrototypeScopedBean$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$xxxxxx
Value of member is X, class is : com.xxx.MyPrototypeScopedBean
The member is X, class is : com.xxx.MyPrototypeScopedBean
 But instead, what I see is similar to below: member is set to X, class is : com.xxx.MyPrototypeScopedBean$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$xxxxxx
Value of member is null, class is : com.xxx.MyPrototypeScopedBean
The member is null, class is : com.xxx.MyPrototypeScopedBean
 As if, spring somehow gives me a fresh instance for each reference of the "proto", be it a member access or a method call. My code is obviously more complicated than this, but this is what the design is supposed to do. So, my question is, am I expecting something wrong? Is there any configuration issues that could cause this problem? Or this is just a symptom of a bug in some place else? thank you. Update 1: Following the suggestion of skaffman, I have added the class names, at the end of println statements. Code and outputs are updated to reflect the changes.

@TITLE:Disable hamburger to arrow animation
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement a two-drawer layout with the android v7 support library. I have a navigation drawer on the left (Gravity.START) side and a notification drawer on the right (Gravity.END) side. The problem is that I need the hamburger in the action bar to stay a hamburger when the notification drawer is pulled out, but stay animated and change to an arrow if the navigation drawer is pulled out. Currently it changes to an arrow when either one is pulled out. I have successfully disabled the animation by overriding onDrawerSlide(View, float) and only calling to super.onDrawerSlide(View, float) if the View is the navigation drawer and doing nothing if the View is the notification drawer like this: @Override
public void onDrawerSlide(View drawerView, float slideOffset) {
    // Make sure it was the navigation drawer
    if(drawerView.equals(navigationDrawer)) {
        super.onDrawerSlide(drawerView, slideOffset);
    }
    else {
        // Do nothing
    }
}
 However, once the notification drawer has fully opened, the icon still changes to an arrow. Any idea how to disable this change?
@CODE:onDrawerSlide(View, float) super.onDrawerSlide(View, float) @Override
public void onDrawerSlide(View drawerView, float slideOffset) {
    // Make sure it was the navigation drawer
    if(drawerView.equals(navigationDrawer)) {
        super.onDrawerSlide(drawerView, slideOffset);
    }
    else {
        // Do nothing
    }
} onDrawerOpened onDrawerClosed

@TITLE:ToString and string concatenation - unexpected behavior
@CONTENT:According to the internet when you do String someString = "" + object1 + object2 + object3;
 ToString() is called on each of the objects. But this is not happening! This code: String a = "a" + foo;
String b = "b" + foo.ToString();

Console.WriteLine(a);
Console.WriteLine(b);
 Prints: a
b("key":"foo")
 How is it possible? I made Resharper full cleanup on whole project and it broke code in some place because it removed ToString() in such string concat!! Lost many hours.. Edit: This problem happened in one of small libraries I was using. I cannot provide very short one-file code that will reproduce this but I have created small project with this library and uploaded to github: https://github.com/Vistritium/ToStringCSObjectConcat https://github.com/Vistritium/ToStringCSObjectConcat/blob/master/TestString/Program.cs The library is 1178 lines long.

@TITLE:Find rows that have same value in one column and other values in another column?
@CONTENT:I have a PostgreSQL database that stores users in a users table and conversations they take part in a conversation table. Since each user can take part in multiple conversations and each conversation can involve multiple users, I have a conversation_user linking table to track which users are participating in each conversation: # conversation_user
id  |  conversation_id | user_id
----+------------------+--------
1   |                1 |      32
2   |                1 |       3
3   |                2 |      32
4   |                2 |       3
5   |                2 |       4
 In the above table, user 32 is having one conversation with just user 3 and another with both 3 and user 4. How would I write a query that would show that there is a conversation between just user 32 and user 3? I've tried the following: SELECT conversation_id AS cid,
       user_id
FROM conversation_user
GROUP BY cid HAVING count(*) = 2
AND (user_id = 32
     OR user_id = 3);

SELECT conversation_id AS cid,
   user_id
FROM conversation_user
GROUP BY (cid HAVING count(*) = 2
AND (user_id = 32
     OR user_id = 3));

SELECT conversation_id AS cid,
       user_id
FROM conversation_user
WHERE (user_id = 32)
  OR (user_id = 3)
GROUP BY cid HAVING count(*) = 2;
 These queries throw an error that says that user_id must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function. Putting them in an aggregate function (e.g. MIN or MAX) doesn't sound appropriate. I thought that my first two attempts were putting them in the GROUP BY clause. What am I doing wrong?
@CODE:users conversation conversation_user # conversation_user

@TITLE:C stack odd behavior
@CONTENT:I am using the Hope functional program on Ubuntu 14.04 with gcc 4.8.2, and doing a highly recursive function to find a large number of prime numbers. However, I get a segmentation fault: 0x000000000040e03f in reach cell=<error reading variable: Cannot access memory at address 0x7fffff7feff8> at runtime.c:250
 The segmentation fault occurs when accessing address 0x7fffff7feff8. What the reach routine is doing is unmarking heap items that can be reached by the current expression (using a garbage collection mark-sweep). The stack is very deep (100000+ calls), but there is not a stack overflow: base_memory = 0x7ffff35a4010
top_string = 0x7ffff35a5260
BaseHeap = 0x7ffff35a5260
heap = 0x7ffff603a450
stack = 0x7ffff72da498
TopStack = 0x7ffff7584d60
 The area from base_memory to TopStack was allocated with malloc. Whenever I get a segment violation, the address is always 0x7fffff7feff8, even with very different functions. If you google 0x7fffff7feff8 there are quite a few entries with segment violations with this address, with no solution to the problem. I put code into check that the heap address was in the heap range, but it never failed. I did a gdb find 0x7ffff35a4010,0x7ffff7584d60,0x7fffff7feff8
 and nothing was found. Why does the address 0x7fffff7feff8 show up in so many problems? Is there something amiss with the stack mechanism, or do I need to change the code in some way for the platform?

@TITLE:Best approach to change Xib direction programmatically
@CONTENT:I have an app that has a settings page in which the user can change the app's language. Eventually, the direction of the xibs will change. To explain a bit more, if the language is English for example, the direction will be LTR; However if it's Arabic, it will be RTL. Question What is the best approach to achieve this? Approaches tried with issues NSUserDefaults : When setting the language to "ar-SA", the direction changes successfully but only when it's called in the main class. When I do it in runtime, the app must be restarted to take effect. Even if there's a way to restart the app, it's not recommended and the app risks to be rejected Multiple xibs : This approach will work eventually but I have to create two Xibs files for each UIView. If this is the only solution, can I create two UIViews in one xib file to avoid the confusion? Any other advice? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/27723315/output-gif-from-servletoutputstream
@TITLE:Output GIF from ServletOutputStream
@CONTENT:I'm writing an endpoint that dynamically generates a GIF file. I'll go from the ground up. I have a class named Function that works like an abstract class and I have several classes, in this example AddFunction, that represent small chunks of functionality. In this case, the AddFunction adds some numbers together. When the end point is hit, the ID of the AddFunction is passed to it (it could be any, in this example it's the add function). The code in the controller is as follows: /**
 * Returns the image for a function
 */
@RequestMapping(value = "/function/{functionId}/image.gif", produces = "image/gif")
public void getImage(@PathVariable(value = "functionId") String functionId, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
    Function function = functionService.getFunction(Integer.valueOf(functionId));

    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(FunctionController.class);

    ServletOutputStream servOut = response.getOutputStream();

    // Uses default values if you pass in nulls.
    function.getImage(servOut, null, null);

    servOut.flush();
    servOut.close();
}
 First, the Function is found by it's ID. I have checked, and the correct function is being found. This code is in need of some validation (for example checking the id passed in is a valid number) but I'll get to that later. I then grab the servlet output stream and pass it to the getImage methods of the function. This method generates the GIF that describes the function. This code looks like this: public void getImage(OutputStream out, String staticContent, String changedContent) throws IOException {
    String[] data = {"2", "+", "2", "=", "4"};

    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(AddFunction.class);

    logger.info("Getting the add image.");

    ImageUtils.writeSequenceToImage(ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(out), data, 5, Constants.IMAGE_HEIGHT / 2);
}
 As you can see, it ignores the values and it is using stock data at the moment. It creates an array of values. Each of these values which appear in each frame of the GIF. So what I do is I take the ServletOutputStream and I use the ImageIO.createImageOutputStream to wrap that with an ImageOutputStream object. This is when passed into the writeSequenceToImage method in my own ImageUtils class. The last two values are coordinates for where to write from. In this case, the vertical middle of the image, on the far left. The code for the writeSequenceToImage method is as follows: public static void writeSequenceToImage(ImageOutputStream out, String[] contentList, int x, int y) throws IOException {
    StringBuilder dataBuilder = new StringBuilder();

    Test test = new Test(out, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB, 500, true);

    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ImageUtils.class);

    logger.info("Writing sequence to image.");

    for (String content : contentList) {
        dataBuilder.append(content);

        logger.info("writing " + dataBuilder.toString() + " to the gif.");

        test.writeToSequence(generateAndWriteToImage(dataBuilder.toString(), x, y));
    }
}
 In this code, I am using the class Test (temporary name) which contains code that writes data to a GIF file. All I'm doing here is looping through and adding each value to a frame in the GIF. The code for class Test can be found here. What I do is I build up the String, so in our example the logs would output: 2014-12-31 14:37:15 INFO  ImageUtils:48 - Writing sequence to image.
2014-12-31 14:37:15 INFO  ImageUtils:53 - writing 2 to the gif.
2014-12-31 14:37:15 INFO  ImageUtils:53 - writing 2+ to the gif.
2014-12-31 14:37:15 INFO  ImageUtils:53 - writing 2+2 to the gif.
2014-12-31 14:37:15 INFO  ImageUtils:53 - writing 2+2= to the gif.
2014-12-31 14:37:15 INFO  ImageUtils:53 - writing 2+2=4 to the gif.
 This will give the appearance in each frame of the GIF of it building up the string. Now, I write this to the GIF and I expect it to be pushed straight into the ServletOutputStream, only when I attempt to reference it with the following HTML: <div class="panel columns large-12" ng-show="selectedFunction">
    <h2>{{selectedFunction.name}}</h2>

    <p>{{selectedFunction.description}}</p>

    <p>This function expects a {{selectedFunction.expectedParameterType}} as a parameter.</p>

    <p>This function will return a {{selectedFunction.expectedReturnType}}</p>

    <img src="/autoalgorithm/functions/function/{{selectedFunction.id}}/image.gif" alt="{{selectedFunction.name}}"/>
</div>
 I am seeing the following data returning in Chrome: And I am seeing no image on my page: What I have tried I've tried to see the size of what is coming back. To do this, I have replaced the ServletOutputStream with a ByteArrayOutputStream so I can get the size of the data. If I do this, my code looks like this: /**
 * Returns the image for a function
 */
@RequestMapping(value = "/function/{functionId}/image.gif", produces = "image/gif")
public @ResponseBody byte[] getImage(@PathVariable(value = "functionId") String functionId, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
    Function function = functionService.getFunction(Integer.valueOf(functionId));

    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(FunctionController.class);

    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    // Uses default values if you pass in nulls.
    function.getImage(baos, null, null);

    logger.info("The number of bytes returned is " + baos.toByteArray().length);

    return baos.toByteArray();
}
 And the log outputs: 2014-12-31 15:34:09 INFO  FunctionController:85 - The number of bytes returned is 0
 So that is telling me that it isn't being written too. So I changed up my approach and refactored the code so I maintained a reference to the ImageOutputStream in my controller. This meant that I had complete control over the object, so now the log outputted: 2014-12-31 15:39:56 INFO  FunctionController:85 - The number of bytes returned is 2708
 Which was encouraging! And 2KB sounds about right for a very very simple GIF. However, when I check the response from Google, similar story: Although this time it has a content length, but there is no preview available and the image still is not appearing. I was wondering if anyone on here had tackled a similar issue? I suspect it is to do with the encoding of the GIF, but ImageIO doesn't support conversion from one stream to another, only from one BufferedImage type to another. So I used the ImageIO.read method to read it into a BufferedImage and used ImageIO.write to write it as a gif onto the ServletOutputStream. This yielded the following error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: image == null!
 At this point, I'm stumped. I'm hoping a fresh set of eyes can help me out. Does anyone have any ideas?

@CONTENT:In Google's OpenID Migration Guide, for transitioning from OpenID 2.0 to OpenID Connect, step 1 is that I need to obtain OAuth credentials for my application. One thing I like about "regular" OpenID is that I can allow my users to authenticate from any IDP of their choosing. Whether they use Google, Yahoo, or any other endpoint, as a developer I don't need to go through the trouble of manually obtaining OAuth credentials from each of those providers and configuring my application to support them. As providers discontinue support for traditional OpenID, is there a way for me to allow users to continue using their current IDPs without me having to go through each one and manually obtaining OAuth credentials?

@TITLE:C++ console input blocks so i can't kill thread
@CONTENT:My program has many different threads handling different things, and one of them deals with user input. The other threads don't have much in the way of blocking calls, and those that do block are network based so will be interrupted or return gracefully when the socket is shut down. However the user thread has calls to std::cin in order to grab the user input. The effect this has is while all the other threads are dead the user thread is still blocking on user input, and will only die the next time input is given. Is there any way for me to check if there is any user input to grab before blocking? I understand cin.peek() exists but from my experience, it blocks if there is nothing to read in. Assuming I'm using it correctly My code is basically an infinite loop that stops when another thread switches the condition variable: void doLoop()
{
    while (running) //running is shared between all threads and all others die quickly when it is false. It's set to true before the threads are started
    {
        string input = "";
        getline(cin, input);

        //Handle Input

    }

@TITLE:Symfony2 Validator message: Which variables are available?
@CONTENT:At this moment I am implementing validation using the Symfony Validator component using Annotations in my Entity class. The Symfony documentation shows you can use certain placeholders to pass variables through a message and these messages can be translated by the Translator component. So for example, it's possible to write the following annotation: /**
 * Assert\Length(
 * min = 5,
 * max = 10,
 * minMessage = "Title too short: {{ limit }}",
 * maxMessage = "Title too long: {{ limit }}"
 */
 protected $title;
 This works fine, but I was wondering what kinds of placeholders are available to you? Is it possible to create custom placeholders? I know that the {{ value }} placeholder exists (and works), but it's not on the documentation page of Symfony on how to use the Length validation. I would like to use a placeholder tag like {{ key }} or {{ name }} to pass through the technical name of the field (in this case "title"), so i can write my minMessage as minMessage = "{{ field }} too short: {{ limit }}" I tried to check the standard components for Symfony to see how these placeholders are handled, but I cannot find a proper list of variables that are available to me. Please help me! T_T
@CODE:/**
 * Assert\Length(
 * min = 5,
 * max = 10,

 This javascript functioned to check which option select by user. If user choose one option, then another option which has required input will be ignored/removed, and vice versa. The javascript is working great in validate the form if I submit the form directly with form action like <form action="submit.php"/>. However, when I change the way to submit it which is now with ajax, the validation is ignored. Here is the ajax script to submit the form: $('#btn_submit').on('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    var esquantity = $('.row_selected select').map(function() { return $(this).val(); }).get().join('|');
    var size = $('.row_selected td.size span').map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).get().join('|');

    $.ajax(
    {
        type: "POST",
        url: "../ajax.php",
        data: 'esquantity='+esquantity+ '&size='+ size,

        success:function(html)
        {
            alert("Succes " + html);
        }
    });
 Can anybody help me how to solve this please, so that this form will have some validations even though I submit it with ajax. Thanks!

@TITLE:Swift, Change width of UICollectionViewCell and UILabel(inside the cell) programmatically
@CONTENT:I've set the width of a cell(UICollectionViewCell) to be equal to the width of the UICollectionView and I'm trying to do exactly the same thing with the UILabel that is included inside that cell. I think the code below explains exactly what I'm trying to achieve. So i've read some question here in SO and also a couple of tutorials but I'm still not sure how I can achieve this. In a couple of questions it was saying about using collectionViewLayout but I'm really struggling on how to use it within my code. Any ideas? Thank you! func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    var cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier("myCell", forIndexPath: indexPath) as LocationViewCell
    cell.locationLabel.text = "Hello there!"

    // Set cell & label width to 100%
    let collectionViewWidth = self.collectionView.bounds.size.width
    cell.frame.size.width = collectionViewWidth // Works
    cell.locationLabel.frame.size.width = collectionViewWidth // Does NOT 
 Update 1 So I added the following: func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> CGSize {
    // Set cell width to 100%
    let collectionViewWidth = self.collectionView.bounds.size.width
    return CGSize(width: collectionViewWidth, height: 35)
}
 What happens is that when the view is loaded the UILabel's width is still small. If I go to another view and then return back then it's 100%. So I have to do something in the viewDidLoad() right? I'm already using self.collectionView.reloadData() but I guess that's only for data. Update 2 func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    var cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier("locationCell", forIndexPath: indexPath) as LocationViewCell
    cell.locationLabel.text = "Hello UILabel"

    // Set cell width to 100%
    let collectionViewWidth = self.collectionView.bounds.size.width
    cell.frame.size.width = collectionViewWidth
    cell.locationLabel.frame.size.width = collectionViewWidth

    return cell
}
@CODE:collectionViewLayout func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    var cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier("myCell", forIndexPath: indexPath) as LocationViewCell
    cell.locationLabel.text = "Hello there!"

    // Set cell & label width to 100%
    let collectionViewWidth = self.collectionView.bounds.size.width
    cell.frame.size.width = collectionViewWidth // Works
    cell.locationLabel.frame.size.width = collectionViewWidth // Does NOT func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> CGSize {

    return CGSize(width: collectionViewWidth, height: 35)

@TITLE:Notification action button not clickable in lock screen
@CONTENT:In order to better support Android 5 notifications, I am now setting my app's notification visibilty to "public". After considering the answers on Lollipop Notification setVisibility() Does Not Work?, the notification is now displayed as expected. However, when I want to click the action button of the notification, I first have to unlock the device which should not be required. (The action shows that a password database is unlocked and the action button will lock the database.) This is the code I am using the creating the notification (using Xamarin's Mono for Android): NotificationCompat.Builder builder =
                new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)
                    .SetOngoing(true)
                    .SetSmallIcon(Resource.Drawable.ic_notify)
                    .SetLargeIcon(...)
                    .SetVisibility((int)Android.App.NotificationVisibility.Public)
                    .SetContentTitle(...)
                    .SetContentText(...);

builder.AddAction(Resource.Drawable.ic_action_lock, GetString(Resource.String.menu_lock), PendingIntent.GetBroadcast(this, 0, new Intent(Intents.LockDatabase), PendingIntentFlags.UpdateCurrent));
 where this is a Service instance. I know that MediaStyle notifications have clickable buttons, but it feels like a hack to use MediaStyle even though it's not about media. Is there any way I can make my action usable from the lock screen?
@CODE:NotificationCompat.Builder builder =
                new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)

@LINK:/questions/27671520/magic-in-c-with-this-expression-x-y-x-y-x
@TITLE:Magic in C++ with this expression x = y - x + (y = x) [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Why are these constructs (using ++) undefined behavior? 11 answers In Python, you can easily exchange the values of 2 variables with an expression like this: x, y = y, x
 In C++, on the other hand, if you want to exchange the values of 2 variables, you usually use a temporary variable to store the value of one of your variables, something like this: int var1 = 100;
int var2 = 200;

int temp = var1;
var1 = var2;
var2 = temp;
 This is easy, but you have to write a lot of code. A professor that I have been following for his lectures on C++ has discovered a new compact way of exchange the values of 2 variables in a magic way: int x = 200;
int y = 100;

x = y - x + (y = x);
 It seems incredible, but it works both with the compiler he's using and mine Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.56). It seems that the way that expression is interpreted is the following: (y = x) // returns the value of x -x + x = 0 x = y + 0 x = y y = x // finally, y receives the initial value of x If I try to exchange the values of some variables in a loop, it seems also to work: for (int i = -10; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 10; j >= -10; j--) {
        int x = i, y = j;
        x = y - x + (y = x);

        std::cout << "x = " << x << "\ny = " << y << '\n';
    }
}
 We have seen that the exchange is done, but my compiler gives me this warning: main.cpp:28:22: warning: unsequenced modification and access to 'y' [-Wunsequenced] If there's a warning, I suppose this is not a new standard way of exchanging the values of 2 variables, but was just an ingenious workaround of this professor. Why this method is not standardised in C++, and why exactly does it work?
@CODE:x, y = y, x int var1 = 100;
int var2 = 200;

int temp = var1;
var1 = var2;
var2 = temp; int x = 200;
int y = 100;

x = y - x + (y = x); Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.56) for (int i = -10; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 10; j >= -10; j--) {
        int x = i, y = j;
        x = y - x + (y = x);

        std::cout << "x = " << x << "\ny = " << y << '\n';
    }

@CONTENT:Using the Pinterest-IOS SDK (2.3) I'm getting a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error when creating an instance of the SDK via the Swift Bridge and then calling createPinWithImageURL. When converting the same code back to objective-c and then calling a wrapper method from Swift it works as expected. The root cause seems to be passing the appID and suffix strings from Swift to Objective-C. This code fails: self.pinterest = Pinterest(clientId:"your_app_id", urlSchemeSuffix:"prod")!
if(pinterest.canPinWithSDK()) {
    pinterest.createPinWithImageURL(NSURL(string: imageUrl)!, sourceURL:NSURL(string: sourceUrl)!, description:pinDescription)

 This succeeds when setting appId on the objective-c side:     self.bainterest = PinterestWrapper.sharedInstance()

@TITLE:Agda, type of proofs and with clause
@CONTENT:In AgdaIntro, the view section explains : ..that with doesn¡¦t remember the connection between the with-term and the patterns. That means when you defines data   False : Set where
record True  : Set where

isTrue : Bool -> Set
isTrue true  = True
isTrue false = False

infixr 30 _:all:_
data All {A : Set}(P : A -> Set) : List A -> Set where
  all[]   : All P []
  _:all:_ : forall {x xs} -> P x -> All P xs -> All P (x :: xs) 

satisfies : {A : Set} -> (A -> Bool) -> A -> Set
satisfies p x = isTrue (p x)

data Find {A : Set}(p : A -> Bool) : List A -> Set where
  found : (xs : List A)(y : A) -> satisfies p y -> (ys : List A) -> 
           Find p (xs ++ y :: ys)
  not-found : forall {xs} -> All (satisfies (not ? p)) xs -> 
              Find p xs
 And you want to prove find1 :{A:Set}(p:A->Bool)(xs:ListA)->Find p xs 
find1 p [] = not-found all []
find1 p(x::xs) with p x
...| true  = found [] x {!!} xs
...| false = {!!}
 The type of the hole ({! !}) is isTrue (p x), even though we already matched on p x and found out that it was true. The compiler is not aware that we did pattern match on p x and asks us for a proof that p x is true ! This motivates the introduction of a new type, the ..type of elements of a type A together with proofs that they are equal to some given x in A. data Inspect {A : Set}(x : A) : Set where
  it : (y : A) -> x == y -> Inspect x

inspect : {A : Set}(x : A) -> Inspect x
inspect x = it x refl
 With this type, the function find can be written : trueIsTrue : {x : Bool} -> x == true -> isTrue x
trueIsTrue refl = _

falseIsFalse : {x : Bool} -> x == false -> isFalse x
falseIsFalse refl = _

find : {A : Set}(p : A -> Bool)(xs : List A) -> Find p xs
find p [] = not-found all[]
find p (x :: xs) with inspect (p x)
... | it true prf = found [] x (trueIsTrue prf) xs
... | it false prf with find p xs
find p (x :: ._) | it false _   | found xs y py ys =
  found (x :: xs) y py ys
find p (x :: xs) | it false prf | not-found npxs =
  not-found (falseIsFalse prf :all: npxs)
 NOW, If I want to prove the following property : predicate : ? {A : Set} {p : A -> Bool } {xs : List A } -> 
            All (satisfies' p) (filter p xs)
 I will have the same issue as with find, so I need pattern match on inspect to get a witness, but i ALSO need to have the compiler to progress on filter in the case p x == true ! If I do some parallel pattern matching, the compiler treats them as independent expressions predicate {A} {p} {xs = []} = all[]
predicate {A} {p} {xs = x :: xs} with p x
predicate {A} {p} {x :: xs} | px with  inspect (p x) 
predicate {A} {p} {x :: xs} | true | it true pf = {!!}
predicate {A} {p} {x :: xs} | true | it false pf = {!!} 
predicate {A} {p} {x :: xs} | false | it true pf = {!!}
predicate {A} {p} {x :: xs} | false | it false pf = {!!}
 How can I tell the compiler that the two branches are linked somehow ? Should I add a proof of it ?

@TITLE:Docker build/push every time - is it practical for continuous deployment?
@CONTENT:Is it really practical to completely rebuild and push a docker image every time you deploy, if you are deploying 5-10 times a day? I acknowledge the benefits, as mentioned in CircleCI's Continuous Integration and Delivery with Docker, namely: Note that Elastic Beanstalk also allows you to deploy a Dockerfile and associated source code instead of a built image, but pre-building the image on CircleCI and running some form of verification on it allows your deployments to be more deterministic because you remove the build environment as a variable that differs between test and production. However, our fully built webapp image is close to 1GB once all dependencies and source code are included. I just don't see how it's practical to be deploying up to 200GB/month (i.e. 10 commits daily, continuously deployed) when practically 99% of it does not change between builds. i.e. it might just be 1k worth of HTML, JS or CSS that's changed to add a feature. I would prefer an approach where the docker image contains rarely-changed software and the rest is zipped up as part of a bundle. This would still result in a self-contained deploy file (no further dependencies requiring download) but reduce build time and bandwidth substantially.

@TITLE:C vs C++ performance (for handling short strings)
@CONTENT:Edit My test result is here. Although someone insists on my test is perfectly wrong, C++ was 110% slower than C ;( Recently, Bjarne Stroustrup have wrote Five Popular Myths about C++ In his article, he implemented a function in C and C++ C++ Version string compose(const string& name, const string& domain)
{
  return name+'@'+domain;
}
 C Version char* compose(const char* name, const char* domain)
{
  char* res = malloc(strlen(name)+strlen(domain)+2); // space for strings, '@', and 0
  char* p = strcpy(res,name);
p += strlen(name);
  *p = '@';
  strcpy(p+1,domain);
  return res;
}
 Finally he mentioned: which version is likely to be the most efficient? Yes, the C++ version, because it does not have to count the argument characters and does not use the free store (dynamic memory) for short argument strings. Is this right? although C++ version is shorter than C version I think operator+() of std::string would be similar to C version.
@CODE:C++ C string compose(const string& name, const string& domain)
{
  return name+'@'+domain;
} char* compose(const char* name, const char* domain)
{
  char* res = malloc(strlen(name)+strlen(domain)+2); // space for strings, '@', and 0
  char* p = strcpy(res,name);
p += strlen(name);
  *p = '@';
  strcpy(p+1,domain);
  return res;

@TITLE:Facebook externalhit_uatext robot lowercasing urls
@CONTENT:I'm working on a site that has mixed-case urls, similar to youtube. We generate IDs on the server, and I chose base 62 (numbers, lower and uppercase letters) so they would be shorter. So the urls might be something like example.com/user/123AbCaBc The facebook robot seems to be hitting my site regularly with an all-lowercase version example.com/user/123abcabc This causes a 404 error as the all-lowercase ID isn't in the database. According to the logs, there aren't other user agents creating 404s, so this is for sure a robot and not a human. Here's the user agent I'm seeing: facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php) This happens about once every 4 minutes. I'm not currently logging non-404 hits, so I'm not sure if there are others to the non-lowercase version. The server tech here is nodejs / mongodb, but I don't see how that is relavant to the issue at hand. Is there something I can do to fix facebook? Is there a problem here, or should I squealch these log errors? Anyone else have a similar problem?

@TITLE:Replace array-mapped variables with the actual variable name/string?
@CONTENT:I am trying to edit a Greasemonkey/jQuery script. I can't post the link here. The code is obfuscated and compressed with minify. It starts like this: var _0x21e9 = ["\x67\x65\x74\x4D\x6F\x6E\x74\x68", "\x67\x65\x74\x55\x54\x43\x44\x61\x74\x65", ...
 After "decoding" it, I got this: var _0x21e9=["getMonth","getUTCDate","getFullYear", ...   
 It is a huge list (500+ ). Then, it has some variables like this:  month = date[_0x21e9[0]](), day = date[_0x21e9[1]](), ...
 _0x21e9[0] is getMonth, _0x21e9[1] is getUTCDate, etc. Is it possible to replace the square brackets with the actual variable name? How? I have little knowledge in javascript/jQuery and can not "read" the code the way it is right now. I just want to use some functions from this huge script and remove the others I do not need. Update: I tried using jsbeautifier.org as suggested here and in the duplicated question but nothing changed, except the "indent". It did not replace the array variables with the decoded names. For example: jsbeautifier still gives: month = date[_0x21e9[0]](). But I need: month = date["getMonth"](). None of the online deobfuscators seem to do this, How can I? Is there a way for me to share the code with someone, at least part of it? I read I can not post pastebin, or similar here. I can not post it the full code here. Here is another part of the code: $(_0x21e9[8] + vid)[_0x21e9[18]]();    
 [8] is "." and [18] is "remove". Manually replacing it gives a strange result.
@CODE:var _0x21e9 = ["\x67\x65\x74\x4D\x6F\x6E\x74\x68", "\x67\x65\x74\x55\x54\x43\x44\x61\x74\x65", ... var _0x21e9=["getMonth","getUTCDate","getFullYear", ... month = date[_0x21e9[0]](), day = date[_0x21e9[1]](), ... month = date[_0x21e9[0]]() month = date["getMonth"]() $(_0x21e9[8] + vid)[_0x21e9[18]]();

@TITLE:Correct audio volume output decibels using HTML5 / javascript, turn off pre-processing
@CONTENT:We have observed that using javascript-based audio from a browser, the output level is not correctly linearly proportional to the input signal level on many systems. For example, if you 'play' two sin waves with amplitude varying by 20dB, the resultant difference from different devices/settings may be markedly different from 20dB, e.g. as far off as 10dB or less. We need to put out simple audio signals (e.g. sin waves) at calibrated decibel levels relative to each other, for example put out one sin wave at one volume, then put out another sin wave that is 20dB quieter than the first one, and have them actually come out that way. We would like to do this from a browser using HTML5/javascript. We have tried to do this in several ways, e.g. using pre-created, calibrated .mp3 files, using the Web Audio API directly to generate an oscillator with calibrated dB levels. We have gotten (to us) very surprising and basically incorrect results. When we have measured the resulting sounds coming out of the device using a calibrated microphone, all kinds of weird things have been observed, indicating that audio is not just 'played' in a linear way, but complex pre-processing is being done on it before it actually gets output. This seems to depend on all kinds of variables currently outside of our control. It does not work the way that a 'normal' audio amplifier works, ie that a 20dB louder input produces a 20dB louder output, whatever the absolute level is set to. We have found that using the same javascript code produces very different results depending on all kinds of variables including the hardware (e.g. browsing on Mac vs. iPhone), the volume settings chosen (even the relative values not different by 20dB for 20dB difference in input when volume is at 1/2), if headphones are used, etc. In further testing, it appears that the primary problem is related to the use of external speakers. When using headphones, the results look much better. The basic problem is that if you create two different signals with known differences in volume, eg 20dB, and put them both out in any of several ways, the measured difference will often not be 20dB, and is in some cases as bad as 10dB. Is there some way to programmatically do this? Is there a way to override whatever pre-processing or audio volume compression seems to be adjusting the volume (causing output that is not correctly proportional to input)? We need a way to do this that will work across platforms (desktop, iOS, Android, different browsers, different headphones/speakers), hence the use of HTML5. If it isn't possible to do this using HTML5, how can we do it using native iOS/Android code? This appears to be more of a hardware than a software problem, but perhaps there are ways to override it. Thanks

public class HibernateUtil {
    private static SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {

        if (sessionFactory == null) {
            // loads configuration and mappings
            Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure();

                    .applySettings(configuration.getProperties()).build();

            // builds a session factory from the service registry
            sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory(serviceRegistry);           
        }

        return sessionFactory;
    }
}
 And part of my DaoImpl i'm using for login:   public User login(String username, String password) {

        User result = null;

        Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
        try {
            String sql = "select s from User s where username=:username and password=password(:password)";
            Query query = session.createQuery(sql);
            query.setString("username", username);
            query.setString("password", password);
            result = (User) query.uniqueResult();
        }
        finally {
            session.close();
        }

        return result;
    }
 I'm not 100% shure its problem with hibernate because i'we connected over SSH removed all in wildfly/standalone/deployments/ and restarted app but i'm still getting floowing error when i execute gear start command. 2014-12-20 04:46:47,792 WARN  [org.hornetq.core.server] (hornetq-failure-check-thread) HQ222082: error on connection failure check: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread

@LINK:/questions/27577659/sql-localdb-automatic-instance-startup-failure-when-called-from-visual-studio-20
@TITLE:SQL LocalDb Automatic Instance Startup Failure when called from Visual Studio 2013, but not SQL Server Management Studio
@CONTENT:Per MSDN Docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh510202.aspx LocalDB supports two kinds of instances: Automatic instances and Named instances. I suspect this has something to do with my problem, so I am wondering if anyone knows how something like this gets automatically created. If I can quote from the docs, "One automatic instance of LocalDB exists for every version of LocalDB installed on the user¡¦s computer." Here is a copy of the relevant section in the above link: Automatic instances of LocalDB are public. They are created and managed automatically for the user and can be used by any application. One automatic instance of LocalDB exists for every version of LocalDB installed on the user¡¦s computer. Automatic instances of LocalDB provide seamless instance management. There is no need to create the instance; it just works. This allows for easy application installation and migration to a different computer. Different versions of LocalDB will have different instance naming conventions: SQL 2012 LocalDB = V11.0
SQL 2014 LocalDB = ProjectsV12
 I've seen others. As long as the connecting app's connection string points to the correct instance, all is well: (localdb)\V11.0
(localdb)\ProjectsV12
 If I try to connect with SQL Server Management Studio to either instance (localdb)\V11.0 or (localdb)\ProjectsV12, I CAN, the "stopped" server "autostarts". If I set the SQL Server instance in VS2013 to either instance (localdb)\V11.0 or (localdb)\ProjectsV12, I CANNOT, the "stopped" server "fails" to start. It attempts to start, but fails. Here is the error message found in the instance error.log indicating why the instance start failed. 014-12-19 15:12:14.09 Logon       Error: 17828, Severity: 20, State: 3.
2014-12-19 15:12:14.09 Logon      The prelogin packet used to open the connection is structurally invalid; the connection has been closed. Please contact the vendor of the client library. [CLIENT: <named pipe>]
 I may have found a clue here: On one of my machines where Automatic Instancing works, the sqllocaldb command outputs following: C:\>sqllocaldb info v11.0
Name:               v11.0

 I have spent days trying to find the answer to this question. Here is a link to an MSDN forum post that outlines all the unsuccessful steps I have taken to resolve this issue: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/83ad45d5-15c3-4463-bc0c-6c4899bf947e/localdb-visual-studio-2013-will-not-automatically-start-the-sql-2014-localdb-projectsv12-instance?forum=sqlexpress The workaround is to just start the instance manually before you start VS2013. I'm just trying to resolve this issue so I can get an "Automatic Instance" image for all our developers. I hope you just know he answer. :-) Thanks, Dave

 If I remove get_search_results, then list_filter works as expected. I want to keep it because I want the search fields to work how I expect, but I also want the list filtering to work as it normally does. Is there a way that I can use both of these together? And is there a reason why one influences the other?

@LINK:/questions/27577659/sql-localdb-automatic-instance-startup-failure-when-called-from-visual-studio-20
@TITLE:SQL LocalDb Automatic Instance Startup Failure when called from Visual Studio 2013, but not SQL Server Management Studio
@CONTENT:Per MSDN Docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh510202.aspx LocalDB supports two kinds of instances: Automatic instances and Named instances. I suspect this has something to do with my problem, so I am wondering if anyone knows how something like this gets automatically created. If I can quote from the docs, "One automatic instance of LocalDB exists for every version of LocalDB installed on the user¡¦s computer." Here is a copy of the relevant section in the above link: Automatic instances of LocalDB are public. They are created and managed automatically for the user and can be used by any application. One automatic instance of LocalDB exists for every version of LocalDB installed on the user¡¦s computer. Automatic instances of LocalDB provide seamless instance management. There is no need to create the instance; it just works. This allows for easy application installation and migration to a different computer. Different versions of LocalDB will have different instance naming conventions: SQL 2012 LocalDB = V11.0
SQL 2014 LocalDB = ProjectsV12
 I've seen others. As long as the connecting app's connection string points to the correct instance, all is well: (localdb)\V11.0
(localdb)\ProjectsV12
 If I try to connect with SQL Server Management Studio to either instance (localdb)\V11.0 or (localdb)\ProjectsV12, I CAN, the "stopped" server "autostarts". If I set the SQL Server instance in VS2013 to either instance (localdb)\V11.0 or (localdb)\ProjectsV12, I CANNOT, the "stopped" server "fails" to start. It attempts to start, but fails. Here is the error message found in the instance error.log indicating why the instance start failed. 014-12-19 15:12:14.09 Logon       Error: 17828, Severity: 20, State: 3.
2014-12-19 15:12:14.09 Logon      The prelogin packet used to open the connection is structurally invalid; the connection has been closed. Please contact the vendor of the client library. [CLIENT: <named pipe>]
 I may have found a clue here: On one of my machines where Automatic Instancing works, the sqllocaldb command outputs following: C:\>sqllocaldb info v11.0
Name:               v11.0

 I have spent days trying to find the answer to this question. Here is a link to an MSDN forum post that outlines all the unsuccessful steps I have taken to resolve this issue: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/83ad45d5-15c3-4463-bc0c-6c4899bf947e/localdb-visual-studio-2013-will-not-automatically-start-the-sql-2014-localdb-projectsv12-instance?forum=sqlexpress The workaround is to just start the instance manually before you start VS2013. I'm just trying to resolve this issue so I can get an "Automatic Instance" image for all our developers. I hope you just know he answer. :-) Thanks, Dave

 If I remove get_search_results, then list_filter works as expected. I want to keep it because I want the search fields to work how I expect, but I also want the list filtering to work as it normally does. Is there a way that I can use both of these together? And is there a reason why one influences the other?

@TITLE:No mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/WEB-INF/pages/MainPage.jsp] in DispatcherServlet with name 'dispatcherServlet'
@CONTENT:I am trying to configure Spring Boot using annotations. I have class @EnableWebMvc
@Configuration
@ComponentScan({
    ...
})
@EnableTransactionManagement
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@Import({ SecurityConfig.class })
public class AppConfig extends SpringBootServletInitializer {...}
 which contains this View resolver which works fine. @Bean
public InternalResourceViewResolver internalViewResolver() {
    InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver
            = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
    viewResolver.setViewClass(JstlView.class);
    viewResolver.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/pages/");
    viewResolver.setSuffix(".jsp");
    viewResolver.setOrder(1);
    return viewResolver;
}
 But after receiving name of JSP file application raise this error: No mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/WEB-INF/pages/MainPage.jsp] in DispatcherServlet with name 'dispatcherServlet'. I found solution for XML configuration: <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>mvc-dispatcher</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping> 
 But I am using annotation configuration, so this soultion is not suitable for me. I tried to resolve this problem extending AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer public class SpringMvcInitializer extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected Class<?>[] getRootConfigClasses() {
        return new Class[] { AppConfig.class };
    }

    @Override
    protected Class<?>[] getServletConfigClasses() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    //  I thought this method will be equivalent to XML config solution described above
    protected String[] getServletMappings() {
        return new String[] { "/" };
    }

}
 But nothing has changed after this. By the way I looked at few examples with AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer, but I still don't understand how application can use this class when it's not annotated and no instances of this class are created. It's just declared and that's all. Maybe I need to create an instance of this class and attach it anywhere? Anyway I see in log this line: Mapping servlet: 'dispatcherServlet' to [/] So it looks like I have right servlet configuration. I tried this solution but it doesn't help. I removed InternalResourceViewResolver and created application.properties with such content: spring.view.prefix: /WEB-INF/jsp/
spring.view.suffix: .jsp
 But after that I received: javax.servlet.ServletException: Could not resolve view with name 'MainPage' in servlet with name 'dispatcherServlet' So what is the proper way to resolve this problem?

@TITLE:How to you test an angularjs module defined inside an IIFE with jasmine?
@CONTENT:how do I test this module on jasmine ? The problem is that it's very difficult to test the $controller because the function is hidden inside a closure, it¡¦s very difficult to test them. In other words, given the module definition below, writing a unit test for MainCtrl seems impossible. (function () {

    'use strict';

    angular.module('app', []);

    function MainCtrl() {
      var mc = this;
      mc.obj = {
        val : 50  
      };
    }

    angular.module('app').controller('MainCtrl', MainCtrl);

} () );
 and the "typical" jasmine test describe('app', function(){

  beforeEach(module('app'));

  it('should create an objet with val 50', inject(function(_$controller_) {
    var scope = {},
        ctrl = _$controller_('MainCtrl', {$scope:scope});

    expect(scope.obj.val).toBe(50); // returns Expected undefined to be 50.
  }));

});
 When angular inject the _$controller_ service inside the jasmine test function, The instance of the controller created returns with an undefined $scope. So How can you test it? My search on StackOverflow for a solution to this problem, didn't give me the answer I was looking for so I implemented one of my own.
@CODE:$controller (function () {

    'use strict';

    angular.module('app', []);

    function MainCtrl() {
      var mc = this;
      mc.obj = {

} () ); describe('app', function(){

  it('should create an objet with val 50', inject(function(_$controller_) {

@TITLE:Can I read a file and construct hetereogenous objects at compile time?
@CONTENT:Situation: YAML file containing list of heterogeneous objects by name, like so: object: Foo
  name: Joe Bloggs
  age: 26
object: Bar
  location: UK
 Objects do not inherit from any base class or share any sort of relationship between each other apart from the fact that they appear to "live" together. This can contain any number of objects. The list of available types can exist in a typelist in the codebase if required. In my C++ land I have the objects: struct Foo {
  Foo(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}

  std::string name;
  int age;
};

struct Bar {
  Bar(std::string l) : location(l) {}

  std::string location;
};
 And on compilation I want to turn that YAML file into a boost::fusion::vector: boost::fusion::vector<Foo, Bar>(Foo("Joe Bloggs", 26), Bar("UK"));
 Or: boost::fusion::vector<Foo, Bar>(make_obj<Foo>("Joe Bloggs", 26), make_obj<Bar>("UK"));
 Can also be a std::tuple if it makes life easier. Specializations for make_obj can exist for all supported objects if needed. Is this possible? Willing to get my hands dirty with the MPL / other advanced metaprogramming if need be, or, can I do all this with constexpr? C++ version is no worry, can use trunk Clang C++14 if need be.

@CONTENT:Background Sony released an update for the Sony SmartWatch 2 in December 2014. Whilst the update has added new features to the watch, it has unfortunately caused custom watchfaces to break. I have developed over 100 custom watchfaces which are no longer showing the correct time (hours are out but minutes are ok) and are no longer showing dates. There is a related SO post to the similar problem as well. I have based my watchface code on the samples provided by Sony however I want to know if there has been a recent change to the API which requires me to recode my watchface. I am currently utilising the following code to draw the hour hands of my watchface: <com.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.aef.widget.TimeView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:background="@drawable/hour_border_00"
    widgets:timeType="hours_fine" />
 within a TimeLayout in my layout XML for the hour hand of my analog watchface. Question Is there something wrong with my implementation of the analog hour hand from the Sony SmartWatch 2 APIs? If so, how can I best correct it?
@CODE:<com.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.aef.widget.TimeView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:background="@drawable/hour_border_00"
    widgets:timeType="hours_fine" />

@TITLE:ExtJS 5 application + Django rest framework CORS error when changing URL of store
@CONTENT:I am developing a ExtJS application that uses a Django-rest-framework service. I am using CORS headers to allow fetching the data from the service (https://github.com/OttoYiu/django-cors-headers). What happens is that at a point in time I want to change the URL from the store. And when I do that I get the following error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://10.98.0.241:8000/reacsearch/as?_dc=1418831884352&page=1&start=0&limit=25. The request was redirected to 'http://10.98.0.241:8000/reacsearch/as/?_dc=1418831884352&page=1&start=0&limit=25', which is disallowed for cross-origin requests that require preflight.
 In the settings.oy I define the following properties for the CORS CORS_ALLOW_METHODS = (
        'GET',
        'OPTIONS'
    )

CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True
 This works fine when I use URLs to list all the elements in my database, however when I change the store for another URL I get the error above. Also the link works fine in the browser. The store url change is made this way: var store = Ext.getStore(storeName);
store.getProxy().setUrl(newURL);
store.load();
 The difference between the views, is that the two that work on the application are viewsets, while the other is just a generic list class Example1viewset(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    API endpoing that allows metabolites to be viewed.
    """
    queryset = examples1.objects.all()
    serializer_class = Example1Serializer

class Example1SearchList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = Example1Serializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        queryset = Example.objects.all()

        if 'attr' in self.kwargs:
            queryset = queryset.filter(Q(attribute1__contains=self.kwargs['attr']) | Q(attribute2__contains=self.kwargs['abbr']))

        return queryset
 Like I mentioned both examples work fine in the browser (even accessing through other computers in the network), however in the application when changing the URL of the store I get the CORS error. Does anyone has any idea why this is happening? Thank you. Edit: Just for clarification, the problem is not in changing the url of the store. As I tried to set those urls as defaults, but they are not working when accessing from the application. My urls.py file: router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'example', views.Example1ViewSet)

# Wire up our API using automatic URL routing.
# Additionally, we include login URLs for the browsable API.
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^', include(router.urls)),
    url(r'^reacsearch/(?P<attr>.+)/$', Example1SearchList.as_view()),
    url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
 Can it be that the problem is related with the fact that I am not adding the search list to the router? Edit2 Problem solved since I was trying to fetch data from a different domain. I changed the type of store to jsonp in Extjs, and I also allowed my rest service to render data as jsonp. Just a reminder if anyone comes accross this same problem, it is necessary to add ?format=jsonp to the store url: http://my/url/?format=jsonp

I triple-checked the password for the second user - it is definitely correct. This is the stack trace I get: Invalid username or password.

@TITLE:Cannot write in InputBox inside a frame of a website
@CONTENT:this post is the following of Vba - filling Internet Explorer inputbox We tried to isolate the problem and it seems that I'm not able (maybe due to a JavaScript in the page? - Please take a look to the other post) to correctly address to the specific InputBox I want. The code which I wrote: Sub AddInfoFromIntranet()

Dim Ie As SHDocVw.InternetExplorer
Dim Doc As MSHTML.HTMLDocument
Dim Elements As MSHTML.IHTMLElementCollection

    Set Ie = New SHDocVw.InternetExplorer
    With Ie
        .navigate "[HERE GOES MY WEBSITE]"
        .Visible = True

        Do Until Not .Busy And .readyState = 4
            DoEvents
        Loop

        Set Doc = .document
        Set Elements = Doc.getElementsByName("Nachnamevalue")

        .Quit
    End With

    Set Ie = Nothing

End Sub
 "Nachnamevalue" is a name of an element contained in the "top_window" frame of the web page: The picture above is what I get opening my desired address, pressing F12 and clicking with the "select item" item on the desired inputbox. At the very beginning instead the page is just a bunch of javascripts (opening page - F12 and copying the content of DOM explorer) Now, if I try to see what my "Elements" variable is, I get an object basically empty. If instead I write: Set Elements = Doc.getElementsByName("top_window")
 something is to be found. Unfortunately I'm working on an INTRANET page, so I cannot provide you the address. EDIT: FULL javascript <html><head><script language="JavaScript">

@TITLE:ZipArchive not opening file - Error Code: 19
@CONTENT:Im having issues with my code being able to open a zip file that i have uploaded and moved into a folder, the zip file uploads fine and you can open it in any Zip program however, when i attempt to open it with ZipArchive to extract the data it errors.     $path = "../"; // Upload directory      
    $count = 0;

    foreach ($_FILES['files']['name'] as $f => $name) {     
       if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES["files"]["tmp_name"][$f], $path . $name))
             $count++; // Number of successfully uploaded file
    }

    $kioskFile = $_FILES['files']['name'][0];
    $kioskFile = explode(".", $kioskFile);
    $kioskFile = $kioskFile[0];
    $zipFile = "../" . $kioskFile . ".zip";     

    $zip = new ZipArchive;
    $res = $zip->open($zipFile);
    if ($res === true) {
        $zip->extractTo("./");
        $zip->close();
    } else {
        echo "Error Cannot Open Zip File - Error Code: ";
    }
 When i run the code it shows me a Error Code 19 ZIPARCHIVE::ER_NOZIP - 19 This is the error im getting, however the file exists and if i use zip_open, it returns that it can open the zip file. Any help would be very greatful EDIT1 If i upload a zip file that i manually create (using a zip program) then the upload works fine. However if i use a ZipArchive created zip file, then it instantly errors with a error 19. EDIT2 I have now added a check to make sure the file exists in the right directory and also put a print of the location also, both match, however still the same issue. Error 19     $path = "../"; // Upload directory      
    $count = 0;

    foreach ($_FILES['files']['name'] as $f => $name) {     
       if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES["files"]["tmp_name"][$f], $path . $name))
             $count++; // Number of successfully uploaded file
    }

    $kioskFile = $_FILES['files']['name'][0];
    $kioskFile = explode(".", $kioskFile);
    $kioskFile = $kioskFile[0];
    $realpath = realpath("../");
    $zipFile = $realpath . "\\" .  $kioskFile . ".zip";     

    if (file_exists($zipFile)) {
        $extract = zip_extract($zipFile, "../");
        if ($extract === TRUE) {

        } else {
            echo "The file " . $zipFile . " cannot be opened";  
        }
    } else {
        echo "The file " . $zipFile . " does not exist";
        die();
    }
 UPDATE1 So i think ive narrowed it down to either this bit of code, or the download script that i use to download the .zip file from the system, if i leave the zip on the system and use the exact same bit of code it works fine. Here is my download code, maybe ive missed something on this that is causing the issue.     $fileID = $_GET['id'];
    $backupLoc = "backups/";
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM backups WHERE id = '" . addslashes($fileID) .  "' LIMIT 1";

    $backupFile = $row['backupFile'];
    $zipFile = $backupLoc . "/" . $backupFile . ".zip";
    $zipSize = filesize($zipFile);

@LINK:/questions/27494768/compute-shader-write-to-texture
@TITLE:Compute Shader write to texture
@CONTENT:I have implemented CPU code that copies a projected texture to a larger texture on a 3d object, 'decal baking' if you will, but now I need to implement it on the GPU. To do this I hope to use compute shader as its quite difficult to add an FBO in my current setup. Example image from my current implementation This question is more about how to use Compute shaders but for anyone interested, the idea is based on an answer I got from user jozxyqk, seen here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/27124029/2579996 The texture that is written-to is in my code called _texture, whilst the one projected is _textureProj Simple compute shader const char *csSrc[] = {
    "#version 440\n",
    "layout (binding = 0, rgba32f) uniform image2D destTex;\
     layout (local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16) in;\
     void main() {\
           ivec2 storePos = ivec2(gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy);\
           imageStore(destTex, storePos, vec4(0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0));\
    }"
};
 As you see I currently only want to have the texture updated to some arbitrary (blue) color. Update function void updateTex(){ 
    glUseProgram(_computeShader);
    const GLint location = glGetUniformLocation(_computeShader, "destTex"); 
    if (location == -1){
        printf("Could not locate uniform location for texture in CS");
    }
    // bind texture
    glUniform1i(location, 0); 
    glBindImageTexture(0, *_texture, 0, GL_FALSE, 0, GL_WRITE_ONLY, GL_RGBA32F);
    // ^second param returns the GLint id - that im sure of. 

    glDispatchCompute(_texture->width() / 16, _texture->height() / 16, 1); 
    glMemoryBarrier(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT);

    glUseProgram(0);
    printOpenGLError(); // reports no errors.
}
 Problem If i call the updateTex() outside of my main program object i see zero effect, whereas if I call it within its scope like so:  glUseProgram(_id); // vert, frag shader pipe
  updateTex();
  // Pass uniforms to shader 
  // bind _textureProj & _texture (latter is the one im trying to update) 
 glUseProgram(0);
 Then upon rendering I see this: QUESTION: I realise that setting the update method within the main program object scope is not the proper way of doing it, however its the only way to get any visual results. It seems to me that what happens is that it pretty much eliminates the fragmentshader and draws to screenspace... What can I do to get this working properly? (my main focus is to be able to write anything to the texture & update) Please let me know if more code needs posting.
@CODE:_texture _textureProj const char *csSrc[] = {
    "#version 440\n",
    "layout (binding = 0, rgba32f) uniform image2D destTex;\
     layout (local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16) in;\
     void main() {\
           ivec2 storePos = ivec2(gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy);\
           imageStore(destTex, storePos, vec4(0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0));\
    }"
}; void updateTex(){ 
    glUseProgram(_computeShader);
    const GLint location = glGetUniformLocation(_computeShader, "destTex"); 
    if (location == -1){
        printf("Could not locate uniform location for texture in CS");
    }
    // bind texture
    glUniform1i(location, 0); 
    glBindImageTexture(0, *_texture, 0, GL_FALSE, 0, GL_WRITE_ONLY, GL_RGBA32F);
    // ^second param returns the GLint id - that im sure of. 

    glDispatchCompute(_texture->width() / 16, _texture->height() / 16, 1); 
    glMemoryBarrier(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT);

    glUseProgram(0);
    printOpenGLError(); // reports no errors.
} updateTex() glUseProgram(_id); // vert, frag shader pipe
  updateTex();
  // Pass uniforms to shader 
  // bind _textureProj & _texture (latter is the one im trying to update) 
 glUseProgram(0); _programObject->activate();

@TITLE:Why won¡¦t git further reduce the repository size?
@CONTENT:I have a repository with only one commit that has a checked out size of 95M. However, I cannot get the .git folder size below 213M. However, if I create a new repository with the same file contents, I get a .git folder of only 38M. Is there a way to git to rebuild its objects in such a way as to get the size more in line with the figure from creating a new repository? I tried both git gc --prune=now --aggressive and git repack -adf --window=250 --depth=250 to reduce the repository size. They brought the repository down from the original 220M. I imagine git must be keeping a references somewhere that prevents garbage collection, but I do not know where they would be.

 I created the repository from an existing one with longer history. I used checkout --orphan to create a new baseless branch then did a commit to create a new commit with the state of the repository. I then deleted the original branch and removed the remotes before running gc. $ git --version

@TITLE:MongoDB + wiredTiger + compression - is compression done on client or server?
@CONTENT:MongoDB 2.8-rc0 supports compression via the wiredtiger storage engine, as described in the release notes. My question is: is data compressed in the API at the client level, or on the server? Basically I want to know whether enabling compression will reduce the bandwidth requirement over the network (and as a side-effect increase throughput & reduce latency), if my server and client are sitting on different hosts. Or is this equivalent to running the old mmap storage engine on top of a disk with transparent compression, as discussed for example in this jira? There is some information about the new storage engine here, but I don't have much experience with mongoDB and I'm looking for feedback from somebody who has already experimented with this.

 The Entity-Manager is injected to the data access layer by the container: @PersistenceContext(type = PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION, unitName = "my-pu")
private EntityManager myEntityManager;
 And my public business logic methods are annotated with the @Transactional annotation. As far as I understand the container is responsible for ensuring that the entity-manager returns connections to the pool (in my case HikariCP) once a transaction is done but I did not find any official documentation that describes how the connections are managed. Can anyone explain it to me or provide a good reference that can explain when exactly connections are returned to the pool when using such a configuration? UPDATE: The best related info I could come up with so far (taken from here): The persistence context proxy that implements EntityManager is not the only component needed for making declarative transaction management work. Actually three separate components are needed: The EntityManager Proxy itself The Transactional Aspect The Transaction Manager Let's go over each one and see how they interact. The Transactional Aspect The Transactional Aspect is an 'around' aspect that gets called both before and after the annotated business method. The concrete class for implementing the aspect is TransactionInterceptor. The Transactional Aspect has two main responsibilities: At the 'before' moment, the aspect provides a hook point for determining if the business method about to be called should run in the scope of an ongoing database transaction, or if a new separate transaction should be started. At the 'after' moment, the aspect needs to decide if the transaction should be committed, rolled back or left running. At the 'before' moment the Transactional Aspect itself does not contain any decision logic, the decision to start a new transaction if needed is delegated to the Transaction Manager. The Transaction Manager The transaction manager needs to provide an answer to two questions: should a new Entity Manager be created? should a new database transaction be started? This needs to be decided at the moment the Transactional Aspect 'before' logic is called. The transaction manager will decide based on: the fact that one transaction is already ongoing or not the propagation attribute of the transactional method (for example REQUIRES_NEW always starts a new transaction) If the transaction manager decides to create a new transaction, then it will: create a new entity manager bind the entity manager to the current thread grab a connection from the DB connection pool bind the connection to the current thread The entity manager and the connection are both bound to the current thread using ThreadLocal variables. They are stored in the thread while the transaction is running, and it's up to the Transaction Manager to clean them up when no longer needed. Any parts of the program that need the current entity manager or connection can retrieve them from the thread. One program component that does exactly that is the EntityManager proxy.

@TITLE:How to check that the string is not nil in swift?
@CONTENT:If I declared a String like this: var date = String() and I want to check weather its a nil String or not so that I try something like: if date != nil{
println("Its not nil")
}
 But I got an error like : Can not invoke '!=' with an argument list of type '(@lvalue String, NilLiteralConvertible)' after that I try this: if let date1 = date{
println("Its not nil")
}
 But still getting an error like : Bound value in a conditional binding must be of Optional type So my question is how can I check that the String is not nil if I declare it this way?
@CODE:String var date = String() nil String if date != nil{

 It is working fine in PostgreSQL.When i'm using same query in wso2dss i.e. SELECT addressid, geocode
FROM maddress
WHERE geocode::point <@ circle '((?,?), ?)';    
 It gives me error like : DS Fault Message: Error in 'SQLQuery.processNormalQuery'

  Hint: No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type cast
 But circle is inbuilt geographical function of PostgreSQL then is it necessary to write explicit function? else where is the exact error? Even if i put the query with input parameter as i execute in PostgreSQL then also it's working.If so then why it is not accepting dynamic parameters? Please let me know..

@TITLE:Animating a network graph to show the progress of an algorithm
@CONTENT:I would like to animate a network graph to show the progress of an algorithm. I am using NetworkX for graph creation. From this SO answer, I came up with a solution using clear_ouput from IPython.display and the command plt.pause() to manage the speed of the animation. This works well for small graphs with a few nodes but when I implement on a 10x10 grid, the animation is very slow and reducing the argument in plt.pause() does not seem to have any effect on the animation speed. Here is a MME with an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm where I update the colors of the nodes at each iteration of the algorithm: import math
import queue
import random
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import clear_output
%matplotlib inline

# plotting function
def get_fig(G,current,pred): 
    nColorList = []
    for i in G.nodes():        
        if i == current: nColorList.append('red')
        elif i==pred: nColorList.append('white')
        elif i==N: nColorList.append('grey')        
        elif node_visited[i]==1:nColorList.append('dodgerblue')
        else: nColorList.append('powderblue')
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
    nx.draw_networkx(G,pos,node_color=nColorList,width=2,node_size=400,font_size=10)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# graph creation
G=nx.DiGraph()
pos={}
cost={}
for i in range(100):
    x= i % 10
    y= math.floor(i/10)
    pos[i]=(x,y)    
    if i % 10 != 9 and i+1 < 100: 
       cost[(i,i+1)] = random.randint(0,9)
       cost[(i+1,i)] = random.randint(0,9)
    if i+10 < 100: 
       cost[(i,i+10)] = random.randint(0,9)
       cost[(i+10,i)] = random.randint(0,9)
G.add_edges_from(cost)   

# algorithm initialization

N = random.randint(0,99)
SE = queue.PriorityQueue()
SE.put((0,N))
for i in G.nodes():       
    if i == N: lab[i] = 0        
    else: lab[i] = 9999
    path[i] = None
    node_visited[i] = 0 

# algorithm main loop    
while not SE.empty():
    (l,j) = SE.get()    
    if node_visited[j]==1: continue
    node_visited[j] = 1
    for i in G.predecessors(j):        
        insert_in_SE = 0               
        if lab[i] > cost[(i,j)] + lab[j]:
            lab[i] = cost[(i,j)] + lab[j]
            path[i] = j
            SE.put((lab[i],i))
        clear_output(wait=True)         
        get_fig(G,j,i)
        plt.pause(0.0001)
print('end')
 Ideally I would like to show the whole animation in no more than 5 seconds, whereas it currently takes a few minutes to complete the algorithm, which suggests that plt.pause(0.0001) does not work as intended. After reading SO posts on graph animation (post 2 and post 3), it seems that the animation module from matplotlib could be used to resolve this but I have not been able to successfully implement the answers in my algorithm. The answer in post 2 suggests the use of FuncAnimation from matplotlib but I am struggling to adapt the update method to my problem and the answer in post 3 leads to a nice tutorial with a similar suggestion. My question is how can I improve the speed of the animation for my problem: is it possible to arrange the clear_output and plt.pause() commands for faster animation or should I use FuncAnimation from matplotlib? If it's the latter, then how should I define the update function? Thank you for your help. EDIT 1 import math

@TITLE:Creating distinct list from existing list in Java 7 and 8?
@CONTENT:If I have: List<Integer> listInts = { 1, 1, 3, 77, 2, 19, 77, 123, 14, 123... }
 in Java what is an efficient way of creating a List<Integer> listDistinctInts containing only the distinct values from listInts? My immediate thought is to create a Set<Integer> setInts containing all the values from listInts then call List<Integer> listDistinctInts = new ArrayList<>(setInts); But this seems potentially inefficient - is there a better solution using Java 7? I'm not using Java 8, but I believe using it I could do something like this(?): List<Integer> listDistinctInts = listInts.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
 Would this be more performant than the approach above and/or is there any more efficient way of doing this in Java 8? Finally, (and I'm aware that asking multiple questions might be frowned upon but it's directly related) if I only cared about the count of distinct elements in listInts is there a more efficient way to get that value (in Java 7 and 8) - without first creating a list or set of all the distinct elements? I'm most interested in native Java ways of accomplishing this and avoiding re-inventing any wheels but would consider hand-rolled code or libraries if they offer better clarity or performance. I've read this related question Java - Distinct List of Objects but it's not entirely clear about the differences in performance between the Java 7 and 8 approaches or whether there might be better techniques?

@CONTENT:I'm admittedly an AngularJS newbie but I can't find why this code works in Chrome and Firefox but gives "Access is denied" in the javascript console with IE 11. I need to display a PDF via an authenticated REST call. Ideally this would be displayed in a popup (preview) kind of window. Code thus far looks like: $http.post( url, payload, {

    var fileURL = URL.createObjectURL( file );

}
 The window.open() gives the "access is denied" message for IE11, but works in Chrome and Firefox. I tried changing to window.location(), and got the same error. This isn't a cross-domain issue (everything is in the same foo.net domain).

@CONTENT:Here's what I'd like to do - in Php: given a string, have a result like this: (a()?b|c) a is a function that returns true of false. This should give b or c after calling a() (a()?(b()?d|e)|c). Same principle. The final result should be d, e or c (a()?(b()?d|e)|(c()?f|g)). Same principle. The final result should be d, e, f or g The problem I'm facing is that a (in my previous examples) can be an expression too, like this: ((h() ? a | i) ? (b() ? d | e) | (c() ? f | g))

@TITLE:Parse String to Decimal using any decimal seperator
@CONTENT:I want to parse a string from an Text input to decimal. The value represents a currency value. Currently i got this solution: private Decimal CastToDecimal(string value) 
{
    Decimal result;
    var valid = Decimal.TryParse(value, NumberStyles.Currency, null, out result);

 This works pretty well so far, except for possible culture-differences. I'm german and i expect most users to enter german-style puctuation. But it is possible that someone uses "." instead of "," and the conversion will fail. "123,45£á" => 123.45 "123.456,78£á" => 123456.78 "123.45£á" => 12345 <- I want the result to be 123.45 here Is there a way to automatically detect the used culture for a decimal value? Such that it does not matter if you use german or english punctuation, you still get the same result? Update: Thanks to your help, i created a method which does what i want (i think). private static Decimal CastToDecimal(string value)

@CONTENT:I'm trying to check the readability of a file given the specified path. Here's what I have: def read_permissions(filepath):

    try:
        os.access(filepath, os.R_OK) # Find the permissions using os.access
    except IOError:

 This works and returns True or False as the output when run. However, I want the error messages from errno to accompany it. This is what I think I would have to do (But I know that there is something wrong): def read_permissions(filepath):
    '''Checks the read permissions of the specified file'''
    try:
        os.access(filepath, os.R_OK) # Find the permissions using os.access
    except IOError as e:
        print(os.strerror(e)) # Print the error message from errno as a string

    print("File exists.")
 However, if I were to type in a file that does not exist, it tells me that the file exists. Can someone help me as to what I have done wrong (and what I can do to stay away from this issue in the future)? I haven't seen anyone try this using os.access. I'm also open to other options to test the permissions of a file. Can someone help me in how to raise the appropriate error message when something goes wrong? Also, this would likely apply to my other functions (They still use os.access when checking other things, such as the existence of a file using os.F_OK and the write permissions of a file using os.W_OK). Here is an example of the kind of thing that I am trying to simulate: >>> read_permissions("located-in-restricted-directory.txt") # Because of a permission error (perhaps due to the directory)
[errno 13] Permission Denied
>>> read_permissions("does-not-exist.txt") # File does not exist
[errno 2] No such file or directory
 This is the kind of thing that I am trying to simulate, by returning the appropriate error message to the issue. I hope that this will help avoid any confusion about my question. I should probably point out that while I have read the os.access documentation, I am not trying to open the file later. I am simply trying to create a module in which some of the components are to check the permissions of a particular file. I have a baseline (The first piece of code that I had mentioned) which serves as a decision maker for the rest of my code. Here, I am simply trying to write it again, but in a user-friendly way (not just True or just False, but rather with complete messages). Since the IOError can be brought up a couple different ways (such as permission denied, or non-existent directory), I am trying to get my module to identify and publish the issue. I hope that this helps you to help me determine any possible solutions.
@CODE:def read_permissions(filepath):

@TITLE:Exception running application when adding insights to application using Application Insights Status Monitor Preview
@CONTENT:I'm playing around with the preview, and tried adding insights to a IIS web application deployed locally on my machine. It's a .Net 4.5 application running in a nothing out of the ordinary application pool. When starting the application after adding insights, I get this exception: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensions.Intercept_x64.dll' or one of its dependencies. The module was expected to contain an assembly manifest. I tried "Enable 32-Bit Applications" to both true and false with no difference in result. Has anyone experienced a similar error?

@TITLE:php: How to save the client socket (not closed), so a further script may retrieve it to send an answer?
@CONTENT:I have a client-server application, in which the server may require to send information back to clients. As the client-server pattern does not allow the server to "request" the client, there are 2 solutions: The client pull the server every few time (which is a bad solution) The client maintain an open socket with the server, that allow the server to send new information back when required. Currently, the client (Web app with JavaScript and Html/Css) open a streaming connection to the server (A C++ server) which may send information back to the client. I would like to implement a PHP version of this feature to allow low-cost hosting to work with my program (low-cost hosting usually does not provide access to install/run binaries). The idea is that the client make a request that establish the streaming socket, it save the socket and then, an other request may retrieve this socket and send new information through it. So, my question is: How to save an http socket in PHP, so a further request may retrieve it? How to finish the PHP script without closing the socket? How to save socket information? How to retrieve the socket from a new thread/request? I do not know even if that is possible, I read about pfsockopen, but it seem a bit different to what I need ( I may be wrong ).

@TITLE:Angular ui router parse query params into booleans
@CONTENT:Consider such scenario of a state with query parameters. I'd like to have them declared as flags so I can fetch then in the controller and get true, false or undefined $stateProvider.state('foo.bar', {
         url: '/foobar?flag1&flag2',
         templateUrl: 'foo/bar/template.tpl.html',
         controller: 'FooBarCtrl'
});

myModule.controller('FooBarCtrl', function($stateParams){
         $stateParams.flag1 <<--- is string but can it be of type bool?
         $stateParams.flag2 <<--- is string but can it be of type bool?

});
 Some URL examples: /foobar?flag1=true    -->> should yield {flag1: true, flag2: undefined}
/foobar?flag2=false    -->> should yield {flag1: undefined, flag2: false}
/foobar?flag1=false&flag2=true    -->> should yield {flag1: false, flag2: true}
/foobar?flag1=1&flag2=0    -->> should yield {flag1: true, flag2: false}

etc...
 At the moment $stateParams delivers only strings. Is there away to make the router to parse the params as flags? That would be much more elegant than doing the parsing manually in the controller.
@CODE:true false undefined $stateProvider.state('foo.bar', {
         url: '/foobar?flag1&flag2',

@TITLE:WebAPI CORS with Windows Authentication - allow Anonymous OPTIONS request
@CONTENT:I have a WebAPI 2 REST service running with Windows Authentication. It is hosted separately from the website, so I've enabled CORS using the ASP.NET CORS NuGet package. My client site is using AngularJS. So far, here's what I've been through: I didn't have withCredentials set, so the CORS requests were returning a 401. Resolved by adding withCredentials to my $httpProvider config. Next, I had set my EnableCorsAttribute with a wildcard origin, which isn't allowed when using credentials. Resolved by setting the explicit list of origins. This enabled my GET requests to succeed, but my POST issued a preflight request, and I hadn't created any controller actions to support the OPTIONS verb. To resolve this, I've implemented a MessageHandler as a global OPTIONS handler. It simply returns 200 for any OPTIONS request. I know this isn't perfect, but works for now, in Fiddler. Where I'm stuck - my Angular preflight calls aren't including the credentials. According to this answer, this is by design, as OPTIONS requests are designed to be anonymous. However, the Windows Authentication is stopping the request with a 401. I've tried putting the [AllowAnonymous] attribute on my MessageHandler. On my dev computer, it works - OPTIONS verbs do not require authentication, but other verbs do. When I build and deploy to the test server, though, I am continuing to get a 401 on my OPTIONS request. Is it possible to apply [AllowAnonymous] on my MessageHandler when using Windows Authentication? If so, any guidance on how to do so? Or is this the wrong rabbit hole, and I should be looking at a different approach? UPDATE: I was able to get it to work by setting both Windows Authentication and Anonymous Authentication on the site in IIS. This caused everything to allow anonymous, so I've added a global filter of Authorize, while retaining the AllowAnonymous on my MessageHandler. However, this feels like a hack...I've always understood that only one authentication method should be used (no mixed). If anyone has a better approach, I'd appreciate hearing about it.

@CONTENT:I'm starting a service using startService(new Intent(this, RelayService.class));

    peekService(context, new Intent(context, RelayService.class));
 It all works fine until the service is restarted by the system after application gets killed when other applications need more memory. After restart, the service relaunches the alarm using the same code, but peekService() returns null. Through debugging messages, I see that context in the service and in the broadcast receiver is the same, as well as RelayService object, i.e. these objects are the same objects in memory. How can I solve this problem? If it helps, here are links to the three pieces of the code mentioned: main activity, service, broadcast receiver. P.S. I know that the service is running continuosly because I'm watching the process closely and see it running fine and not restarting in any way, and also because I see that connection it opens before launching the alarm does not get interrupted.
@CODE:startService(new Intent(this, RelayService.class)); AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);

@CONTENT:I am trying to access some exported functions from a MSVS 2013 C/C++ DLL via FireFox's js-ctypes. I have tried : Changing the "Compile As" settings to C and C++ Changing the platform bitness (32 vs 64 bits). Using ALL the available ABI constants from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes (default_abi, stdcall_abi, winapi_abi) I have checked my DLL using "Dependency Walker" and made sure that its name was not decorated and that my function was indeed exported. Here is my DLL code: #define DllExport extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)

DllExport void Test()
{
    ::MessageBox(NULL, _T("Test!"), _T("Title"), MB_OK);
}
 No matter what I try, it seems that I always get this error:  console.error: myxpi:

 Does anyone have any idea what are the proper settings? FF is 32 bits (as far as I know) but I don't know if it uses something else like python to load the DLL. I thought that the "Compile As" wouldn't matter as long as the exporting functions used the proper declaration (e.g. __cdecl). I am not sure what this produces though (but my project settings are for __cdecl): #define DllExport extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)
 But I have tried replacing that too and using DEF files... Any idea why nothing seems to wok? Related questions: Making a C DLL in Visual Studio suitable for use by js-ctypes in Mozilla Build a DLL to be used by Mozilla js-ctypes

@TITLE:Region monitoring beacon regions in background not working
@CONTENT:I have a problem with region monitoring while the app is in background. Region enters and exits get called if the app is in foreground, but doesn't while in the background (sometimes they fire but very rarely). How does beacon region monitoring work for iOS 8.1.1 ? Should region enters/exit fire instantly when in Beacon proximity while in background ? What should I do to make sure it works ?

What I've already done: set these for every region: beaconRegion.notifyOnExit=YES; beaconRegion.notifyOnEntry=YES; beaconRegion.notifyEntryStateOnDisplay = YES; Made sure that everything in settings is in order (app refresh etc.) EDIT: I've created a new project and it still doesn't work.

@TITLE:Firefox Extension/Addon - Detect workspace locked
@CONTENT:I'm searching for a solution in my firefox addon to detect when the user workspace has locked/released. In google chrome there is an easy API chrome.idle.onStateChanged.addListener for it, is there something similar in firefox or any possibility to do that, platform independent? By the way, I use the addon sdk. I've already tried the idle service: Cc["@mozilla.org/widget/idleservice;1"].getService(Ci.nsIIdleService) 
 but I just gives me access to some idle timeout or system when go to sleep and not to just workspace locked. Edit: With "workspace locked" I mean the user lock the workspace with ctrl + alt + delete. I don't know how this exactly work on OSX or linux. Edit2: I working in Windows 8.1 currently, but I guess the chrome.idle handler works cross platform. Edit3: What i currently get out of current answers is 1. That there not exist a cross-platform solution, neither in chrome nor in firefox. chrome.idle.onStateChanged seems to work different on windows, linux and osx. Only windows can handle that "locked" behaviour as expected. I can't test OSX, on ubuntu 14 it doesn't work for me. 2. For firefox there some in-depth code things to try to make it working - see answer bellow from Noitidart in this topic. Edit4: Noitidart have found a solution for windows - github link.

@LINK:/questions/27367170/construct-a-pipes-proxy-inside-out
@TITLE:Construct a pipes Proxy inside-out
@CONTENT:Is it possible to make a function so that a Proxy from pipes can be constructed inside-out? By inside-out, I mean create a proxy from a function that connects the upstream and downstream connections. The most desirable (but impossible) signature would be makeProxy :: (Monad m) =>
             (Server a' a m r -> Client b' b m r -> Effect m r) ->
              Proxy  a' a               b' b               m r
 The first problem we encounter is the mechanical problem of constructing the Proxy. There's no way for us to know if the function looks at the Server or Client except by having each of them be M, in which case we'll only know which one it looked at, not what value it tried to send upstream or downstream. If we focus on the upstream end, the only thing we know is that something tried to figure out what the upstream proxy is, so we need to decide on either always resulting in a Request farther upstream or Responding. Either way we answer, the only value we can provide is (). This means we can make a Request () to an upstream producer or Respond () immediately. If we consider making this choice for both ends, there are only four possible functions. The following functions are named after whether their upstream and downstream connections send interesting data downstream (D) or upstream (U). betweenDD :: (Monad m) =>
             (Server () a m r -> Client () b m r -> Effect m r) ->
              Proxy  () a               () b               m r
betweenDD = undefined

betweenDU :: (Monad m) =>
             (Server () a m r -> Client b' () m r -> Effect m r) ->
              Proxy  () a               b' ()               m r
betweenDU = undefined

betweenUU :: (Monad m) =>
             (Server a' () m r -> Client b' () m r -> Effect m r) ->
              Proxy  a' ()               b' ()               m r
betweenUU f = reflect (betweenDD g)
    where g source sink = f (reflect sink) (reflect source)


betweenUD :: (Monad m) =>
             (Server a' () m r -> Client () b m r -> Effect m r) ->
              Proxy  a' ()               () b               m r
betweenUD = undefined
 betweenDD is the most interesting, it would build a pipe between a Producer and a Consumer; betweenUU would do the same for a pipe running upstream. betweenDU would consume data requesting it from one of two sources. betweenUD would produce data, sending it to one of two destinations. Can we provide a definition for betweenDD? If not, can we instead provide definitions for the following simpler functions? belowD :: (Monad m) =>
          (Producer a m r -> Producer b m r) ->
           Proxy () a              () b m r

aboveD :: (Monad m) =>
          (Consumer b m r -> Consumer a m r) ->
           Proxy () a              () b m r
 This question was motivated by trying to write belowD to use in answering a question about P.zipWith. Example This example happens to be essentially the question that inspired this question.. Let's say we want to create a Pipe that will number the values passing through it. The Pipe will have values a coming downstream from above and values (n, a) leaving downstream below; in other words it will be a Pipe a (n, a). We'll solve this problem by zipping with the numbers. The result of ziping with the numbers is a function (->) from a Producer a to a Producer (n, a). import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P

number' :: (Monad m, Num n, Enum n) => Producer a m () -> Producer (n, a) m ()
number' = P.zip (fromList [1..])
 Even though the Pipe will consume as from upstream, from the point of view of the function it needs a Producer of as to provide those values. If we had a definition for belowD we could write number :: (Monad m, Num n, Enum n) => Pipe a (n, a) m ()
number = belowD (P.zip (fromList [1..]))
 given a suitable definition for fromList fromList :: (Monad m) => [a] -> Producer a m ()
fromList []     = return ()
fromList (x:xs) = do
    yield x

@TITLE:QuickType predictions take key strokes into account that should be blocked by my UITextFieldDelegate
@CONTENT:I have a textField, in which I don't want to allow leading whitespace. So I implemented textField(textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:) and block attempts which would change the text to something that starts with whitespace. This works as expected. Unfortunately this messes up QuickType. Each time I press space in an empty field, which is then ignored by my textField, the Quicktype text gets prefixed with this space. To be more clear, the text that QuickType will insert get's prefixed, the additional whitespace is not shown in the UI of the QuickType bar. func textField(textField: UITextField, shouldChangeCharactersInRange range: NSRange, replacementString string: String) -> Bool {
    let currentText = textField.text as NSString
    let proposedText = currentText.stringByReplacingCharactersInRange(range, withString: string)
    if !proposedText.isEmpty {
        let firstCharacterString = String(proposedText[proposedText.startIndex]) as NSString
        if firstCharacterString.rangeOfCharacterFromSet(NSCharacterSet.whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet()).location == 0 {
            println("starts with whitespace \"\(proposedText)\"")
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
 Here is some logging to see what's happening when I press space 5 times followed by press on the I'm QuickType suggestion: starts with whitespace " "           // pressing space key
starts with whitespace " "
starts with whitespace " "
starts with whitespace " "
starts with whitespace " "
starts with whitespace "     I'm"    // Inserted by QuickType after pressing the "I'm" suggestion
starts with whitespace " "           // Inserted by QuickType as well
 By inspecting the variables in that delegate method I can verify that the problem is indeed with the replacement string, that I get from the UITextField. It already contains the suggestion prefixed with whitespace. Does anybody know how I can prevent that, or how I can "reset" QuickType suggestions? A workaround would be to trim whitespace from multi character inserts, but first I want to see if I'm missing a way to handle the problem in a clean way.

@TITLE:What to test with Robolectric?
@CONTENT:It seems to me that I am fundamentally misunderstanding the purpose of Robolectric. I've been battling with it for a week already, and so far getting a new error message is considered as making progress. I am able to test some basic stuff like static views in an activity, but when something more complicated things come into play things just fall apart. I had to extend Robolectric to support 3-rd party libraries with certain parameters, Appcompat action bars and numerous other things which was extremely time-consuming and wasn't really documented anywhere, and things are advancing at a pretty much glacial pace. I am starting to think that I am using it in a wrong way and it simply isn't supposed to do what I want it to do. The general app logic is quite straightforward so there isn't really much to unit test, the most complicated stuff is in the UI and remote API calls. Is Robolectric just supposed to make unit testing for Android less painful than with JUnit because it can run on the JVM and supports a few Android classes? Perhaps a black-box behaviour testing framework like Espresso would be more suitable for my needs? But we use continuos integration, and Robolectric was nice and easy to set up to run tests on the CI server, and I'd kind of like to keep it that way. What do you use Robolectric for? A lot of blog posts recommend it for "activity lifecycle testing", but since I'm also quite new in the Android world, I don't really understand the purpose of it, especially since the app I'm testing is portrait-only. Could someone please give an overview of what you use Robolectric for, and how do you do it, preferably with code examples and explain why and how those tests are important?

@TITLE:How to configure a GlassFish instance running on AWS/ElasticBeanstalk/Docker?
@CONTENT:I'm using GlassFish to serve up a Java EE web app. Things are working fine on my local dev machine. I have copied postgres JDBC libraries into the right place configured a connection pool and JDBC resource in the Glassfish admin console deployed a web-app that uses said connection seen the results in my browser I'm trying to deploy that same app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk hosted Glassfish instance. AWS-EB uses Docker to deploy the Glassfish instance. I can do only the third step above (deploy a web-app), and am completely at a loss how to do the first two. What I'd love to do is have web-access to the Glassfish admin console via, but that doesn't seem to work at any level. An alternative would be to use the glass fish "asadmin" on my local machine to configure the remote glass fish, but I can't make that happen either. How does one configure a Glassfish instance hosted on AWS EB? Is it even possible? I've made some observations, but I'd appreciate confirmation or otherwise: it appears that AWS have a command in their CLI called 'asadmin' which is about autoscaling, and has the same name as 'asadmin' that ships with glassfish. Apart from making google searches hard, the two seem to have nothing to do with each other if I connect to the AWS EC2 instance containing the Docker and Glassfish instance, the following things happen sudo docker ps returns that there are ports 4848/tcp, 8080/tcp, 8181/tcp, and that none are mapped wget localhost:8080 - connection refused same for 8181 and 4848 wget localhost:80 returns the web page of the Glassfish home page in that same instance running docker inspect I get an internal IP address (call it 1.2.3.4), then on that EC instance wget 1.2.3.4:8080 (and 4848, 8181) all return html files wget 1.2.3.4:80 - connection refused if I run a bash shell in the docker container, the following things appear to be true wget localhost:8080 (and 4848, 8181) all return well formed pages wget localhost:80 - connection refused So maybe I need to tell the EC2 instance to forward on from localhost to 1.2.3.4, but how can I make that happen when the EB load balancer scales it out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:After reading about both, including a high voted answer on this site, I still find this a bit unclear. Since my understanding of the matter might be wrong, I'll first post a synopsis of what I know so I can be corrected if I'm wrong, and then post my specific questions: Sometimes when coding managed code, we have to pass an address to unmanaged code. That's what an IntPtr is for. However, we try to make sure of two opposite things: a) Keep that pointer (to an address) alive from the GC. b) Release it when it's not needed (even if we forget to do that explicitly). HandleRef does the first, and SafeHandle the second. (I'm actually referring here to derivations of SafeHandle listed here). My questions: Obviously, I want to confirm both. So how do I get that functionality? (This is the main question.) From here and From MSDN ("call a managed object") it looks like only someObject.Handle might be GC'd, while a free standing IntPtr will not. But an IntPtr itself is managed! How can an IntPtr be GC'd before it goes out of scope (as mentioned here)?

@TITLE:Recursion that branches running out of memory
@CONTENT:I have a programming assignment that goes like this: You are given three numbers a, b, and c. (1 ? ?, b, c ? 10^18) Each time you have two choises, either add b to a (a+=b), or add a to b (b+=a). Write a program that will print out YES or NO depending on whether you can get to c by adding a and b to each other. I've tried solving this problem using recursion that branches to two branches every time where one branch stores a+b, b and the other branch stores a, b+a. In every recursive call, the function checks the values of a and b, and if they are equal to c the search stops and the function prints YES. The recursion stops when either a or b have a value greater than c. Here's how the branching works: And here's the code in C: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void tree(long long int a, long long int b, long long int c){
    if(a==c || b==c){
        printf("YES");
        exit(0);
    }
    else if(a<c && b<c){
        tree(a, b+a, c);
        tree(a+b, b, c);
    }
}

int main(){
    long long int a, b, c;
    scanf("%I64d", &a);
    scanf("%I64d", &b);
    scanf("%I64d", &c);

    tree(a, b, c);

    printf("NO");

    return 0;
}
 Now, this program works for small numbers, but since a b and c can be any 64-bit number, the tree can branch itself a few billion times, and the program runs out of memory and crashes. My question is: Is there any way i can improve my code, or use any other way (other then recursion) to solve this?

At the moment i figured the following possible solutions: Create an own store class for every view instance. Add all stores to controller and use different Store-ID for every view instance. Do not use stores of controller at all and create a new store in the initComponent of the view manually passing different parameters to each instance of the store. Do not use stores of controller at all and create a new store in the initComponent of the view manually. Then use load to load the store manually using different parameters for each instance of the store. Is any of this solutions the best practice or should it be done differently?

But then I have some actions that are allowed if the user is either the "owner" of that entity, or they are an admin. However, I can't just check the ROLE of the user because I'm looking at the role hierarchy. The example in the docs for this just uses in_array, but that won't work (http://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/security.html) My voter is like this (shortened for clarity). I've tried injecting the security context (or specifically AuthorizationCheckerInterface in 2.6), but that has a circular dependency since this is a voter. <?php
// ...
class ApplicationVoter extends AbstractVoter
{
    const VIEW = 'view';

    /**
     * @var AuthorizationCheckerInterface 
     */
    private $security;

    /*public function __construct(AuthorizationCheckerInterface $security)
    {
        $this->security = $security;
    }*/

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    protected function getSupportedAttributes()
    {
        return array(
            self::VIEW
        );
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    protected function getSupportedClasses()
    {
        return array('Study\MainBundle\Entity\Application');
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    protected function isGranted($attribute, $application, $user = null)
    {
        if (!$user instanceof UserInterface) {
            return false;
        }

        if ($attribute === self::VIEW) {
            return $this->canView($application, $user);
        }

        return false;
    }

    /**
     * Can view own application if not deleted
     * Admin can view if submitted
     * 
     * @param \Study\MainBundle\Entity\Application $application
     * @param \Study\MainBundle\Entity\User $user
     * 
     * @return boolean
     */
    protected function canView(Application $application, User $user)
    {
        return ($application->isOwner($user) && !$application->isDeleted())
            || (!$application->isHiddenToAdmin() && $this->security->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN_RO'));
    }
}
 I'd like to just use the built-in RoleHiearchyVoter here, but it's a non-public service. Is there some solution for this? I'd like to avoid duplicating framework code or making my roles more complicated than just strings if possible. EDIT: Injecting the whole container works, but isn't my ideal solution. Is that the only way I can access the built-in hierarchy from a voter?

@TITLE:Round a timestamp to the nearest date
@CONTENT:I need to group a bunch of items in my web app by date created. Each item has an exact timestamp, e.g. 1417628530199. I'm using Moment.js and its "time from now" feature to convert these raw timestamps into nice readable dates, e.g. 2 Days Ago. I then want to use the readable date as a header for a group of items created on the same date. The problem is that the raw timestamps are too specific - two items that are created on the same date but a minute apart will each have a unique timestamp. So I get a header for 2 Days Ago with the first item underneath, then another header for 2 Days Ago with the second item underneath, etc. What's the best way to round the raw timestamps to the nearest date, so that any items created on the same date will have the exact same timestamp and thus can be grouped together?

@LINK:/questions/27323165/how-to-say-same-class-in-a-swift-generic
@TITLE:how to say ¡§same class¡¨ in a Swift generic
@CONTENT:If a Swift generic type constraint is a protocol name, I can require that two types, constrained to that protocol, be the same type. For example: protocol Flier {}
struct Bird : Flier {}
struct Insect: Flier {}
func flockTwoTogether<T:Flier>(f1:T, f2:T) {}
 The function flockTwoTogether can be called with a Bird and a Bird or with an Insect and an Insect, but not with a Bird and an Insect. That is the limitation I want. So far, so good. However, if I try the same thing with a class name, it doesn't work: class Dog {}
class NoisyDog : Dog {}
class WellBehavedDog: Dog {}
func walkTwoTogether<T:Dog>(d1:T, d2:T) {}
 The problem is that I can call walkTwoTogether with a WellBehavedDog and a NoisyDog. This is what I want to prevent. There are really two questions here: Is there a way to say that walkTwoTogether can't be called with a WellBehavedDog and a NoisyDog? Is this a bug? I ask because if I can't use a generic to say this, it is hard to see why it is useful for a generic constraint to be a class name at all, since we could get the same result just with a normal function.
@CODE:protocol Flier {}
struct Bird : Flier {}
struct Insect: Flier {}
func flockTwoTogether<T:Flier>(f1:T, f2:T) {} flockTwoTogether class Dog {}
class NoisyDog : Dog {}
class WellBehavedDog: Dog {}
func walkTwoTogether<T:Dog>(d1:T, d2:T) {} walkTwoTogether walkTwoTogether where <T:Dog, U:Dog where T.Type == U.Type> Dog

@CONTENT:I have made a very simple iPhone app with Xcode 6.1 and swift. I am really new to ios developing and ran into an app which in the end is 134 mb! of course this is not acceptable. I have background images for all screen sizes which add up to 20 mb. and thats it! I am storing those images in xcassets, as thats the preferred way I guess. the app shouldnt have more than 25 mbs, I think. I figured out that I had some references doubled in my project. I removed these and still my .app file is 89 mbs! What am I doing wrong? I read several threads on this, but nothing really helped! What I did until now: - reduce the size of all pngs
- disable the compress PNG option, as it seems to make the PNGs bigger (lol)
- configured the build settings to run the fastest and smallest build
- Strip Debug Symbols During Copy build setting to Yes (COPY_PHASE_STRIP = YES)
 edit1: Apparenty Xcode does something weird with my pngs. Some of those pictures, that are 2 mb originally, are more than 10mb in the .app-file. What does xcode do there ?

    header('Location: index.php');
 Then index.php is new loaded, but now it opens a modal box with the output from remote.php: <table>

if(isset($output){
    echo $output;
}

<script type="text/javascript">
    // Compare Modal
    $('#rock-modal').modal('show');
</script>
 But now I would like to do the same, but without page reload, i.e. with jQuery. I did some research and asked a question with another approach here in StackOverflow (How to display dynamical content from a remote file in bootstrap modal using php?) to get more information about it. With this valueable info I did the following:     <tr>
        <td>Bruce</td>
        <td>Iron Maiden</td>
        <td>95</td>
        <td>
            <form action="remote.php" class="rock" method="POST">
                <input class="name" name="name" type="hidden" value="James">
                <input class="band" name="band" type="hidden" value="Metallica">
                <input class="inx" name="indx" type="hidden" value="90">
            </form>

            <a class="btn btn-info rock-send" data-modal="#rock-modal" data-href="remote.php">OK</a>
        </td>
    </tr>

$(function() {
    $('.rock-send').on('click', function() {
        var data = $(this).closest('tr').find('>td:lt(3)'),
        modal = $(this).data('modal');
        $.post( $(this).data('href'), {
            name: data.name.text(),
            band: data.band.text(),
            indx: data.indx.text(),
        }, function( data ) {
            $(modal).modal('show');
        });
    });
});
 But somehow it's not working. I'm not sure if the remote.php can read the variables that are sent and give them back. How can I manage it? It's probably a problem in the javascript. I would appreciate any help! Thank you in advance. == EDIT == Here the code of index.php based on the comments. <html>

@TITLE:Can't get Ninject to dispose object in Request Scope
@CONTENT:I can't seem to get Ninject to dispose objects in request scope in an ASP.NET MVC application with web API no matter what I do. What I am doing: Create a new ASP.NET Web Application with Visual Studio 2013. I select the MVC template and add a Web API to it (it also has ASP.NET Identity in the package by default) I install Ninject.MVC5 package via nuget (install-package Ninject.MVC5) I add a the following class to my application: public class SomeDisposable : IDisposable { public void Dispose() { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("test"); } } I add the following binding in NinjectWebCommon RegisterServices method kernel.Bind().ToSelf().InRequestScope(); I add an object of the type SomeDisposable to the Home controller public HomeController(SomeDisposable some) { } I run the application and place a breakpoint in the HomeController constructor and the Dispose method of the SomeDisposable class. The controller receives an object (presumably from Ninject), the page loads but the Dispose method is never called. At this point things are already broken but I add a Web API controller, install Ninject.WebApi packaged and repeat the experiment with the WebAPI controller and I get the same result. I have read a bunch of questions including this one - Ninject doesn't call Dispose on objects when out of scope and the Ninject documentation https://github.com/ninject/Ninject.Web.Common/wiki/InRequestScope and they both indicate that due to the fact that Ninject.Web.Common includes a registration for the OnePerRequestHttpModule (yes it is there) the disposal should just work but it doesn't. I also tried adding the PerRequest module in the web.config and got an error saying that I can't have this section in integrated mode. At this point I am lost. I suspect either integrated mode or OWIN have something to do with this but I have no idea how to debug it or what to do to fix it. Any suggestions?

@LINK:/questions/27302487/magic-move-effect-custom-transition
@TITLE:¡§Magic Move¡¨ Effect Custom Transition
@CONTENT:I trying to get a custom transition between two View Controllers. First, here's a picture to illustrate what I want : I want a UICollectionViewCell to expand to the whole screen. In this cell, the subviews are placed with Autolayout in IB. I just want each subview to go to the new position. So I tried subview.frame = newSubview.frame in the animation block, but it doesn't work (because of Autolayout I think). I thought to delete the constraints while the animation is occuring, but it doesn't work. I also tried to make @IBOutlets of the constraints and to change constant property. Here's my code :     let detailView = detailViewController.view
    let cellView = self.selectedCell

    container.addSubview(cellView!)

    let duration = self.transitionDuration(transitionContext)

    UIView.animateWithDuration(duration, delay: 0.0, options: .CurveEaseInOut, animations: {

            let newFrame = detailViewController.view.frame
            cellView!.frame = newFrame
            cellView!.imageView.frame = newFrame
            cellView!.labelTopConstraint.constant = 27
            cellView!.labelRightConstraint.constant = 8
            cellView!.layoutIfNeeded()
        }

...
 Actually, when the animation begins the labels snap to a position, then they move and at the end they are not at the right position... Any ideas ? Thanks

@LINK:/questions/27301385/can-i-create-a-listweakreferencet
@TITLE:Can I create a List<WeakReference<T>>?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a List of WeakReferences using the 4.5 generic implementation so that I can avoid type checking and casting of the WeakReference target. But, WeakReference<T> doesn't appear to support covariance, so I'm trying to establish a workaround. I'm thinking it should be doable since each T would be of a type in a particular inheritance chain. So, what I'm thinking would be along these lines: public class Animal { }
public class Tiger : Animal { }
public class Wolf : Animal { }

var mylist = new List<WeakReference<Animal>>();

mylist.Add(new WeakReference<Animal>(new Animal()));
mylist.Add(new WeakReference<Tiger>(new Tiger()));
mylist.Add(new WeakReference<Wolf>(new Wolf()));
 I've tried creating a wrapper class for WeakReference (since it's non-inheritable), but that doesn't work. No matter what, the list won't accept any typed WeakReference other than WeakReference<Animal>. I could create my own generic WeakReference implementation, but that would seem to be defeating the point since I'd be doing type casting within it. I can't find any documentation, but I'm kind of assuming the framework version handles this better. Is there another way of handling this that I'm not thinking of, or am I barking up the wrong tree?
@CODE:WeakReference WeakReference WeakReference<T> public class Animal { }
public class Tiger : Animal { }
public class Wolf : Animal { }

var mylist = new List<WeakReference<Animal>>();

mylist.Add(new WeakReference<Animal>(new Animal()));
mylist.Add(new WeakReference<Tiger>(new Tiger()));
mylist.Add(new WeakReference<Wolf>(new Wolf())); WeakReference WeakReference<Animal> WeakReference WeakReference<T> T new WeakReference<Animal>(new Wolf()) WeakReference<T> T

@TITLE:How To Remove Decimal From Magento Prices?
@CONTENT:all I found in my search is a programming solution for this. I know that we can modify /lib/Zend/Locale/Data/en.xml for english stores. there was in en.xml this part:        <currencyFormats>
            <currencyFormatLength>
                <currencyFormat>
                    <pattern>#,##0.00 ?</pattern>
                </currencyFormat>
            </currencyFormatLength>
        </currencyFormats>
 And the price was displaying in this format: 1,321.54 now to remove the decimal part from price I think the only thing I have to do is change en.xml to be like the following: <currencyFormats>
            <currencyFormatLength>
                <currencyFormat>
                    <pattern>#,##0 ?</pattern>
                </currencyFormat>
            </currencyFormatLength>
        </currencyFormats>
 The problem is after this change the prices are show as desired (1,132 Format) but without currency symbol ($). what I'm missing here?? Thanks in advance. update I'm still trying, when pattern node changed to the following <pattern>? #,##0</pattern>
 the prices are coming with currency symbol ($ 1,132) but not in desired position O_O, the requirement is to have currency symbol on the right side no left :( SO..

@CONTENT:Assume I have a method that has void return type and that I need to await on an operation in this method. public void someOperation()
{
    //dostuff
    var res = await someOtherOperation();
    //do some other stuff that needs res.
}
 When I tried to compile this code I got the error saying someOperation has to be declare async. I don't understand why. I understand why it would if the method had a return value, but not here when it's void. or even in the case when the awaiting operation has no effect on the return value of method. This has already been asked as a part of this question but I didn't find the answer I was looking for. This guy merely mentions: The async keyword enables the await keyword. So any method using await must be marked async. First of all, I'm not sure what it means that async keyword enables await keyword. And secondly, restating my question, I'm not sure why it is required?

@CONTENT:Every morning between 8 and 9 am CET my site shows this error: Error Over Quota
This application is temporarily over its serving quota. Please try again later.
 although billing is enabled and the site has been running for many months now. On the old billing status page, there's a setting for Maximum Daily Budget (Set this to handle peak traffic and to buffer against sudden traffic surges.) which is set to $0.00, but even if I change that to e.g. $10.00, it still shows the 503 error, so it seems this has nothing to do with it. The new billing page looks like this: It happens every morning between 7 and 8 am CET, so that would be around midnight PST which would at least indicate that it still might have something to do with billing? Here's how the external monitoring system shows the outages, i.e. multiple outages every morning and then no problems for the rest of the day. The Google Developers Console Overview page Errors by status code also shows the 503 error in green. If I look at the monitoring logs most of the 503 errors between 7 and 9am for the following pages: / /wp-cron.php And then there are some 500 errors, e.g. at 8 am 08:07:08.092 ...

 The (new) quota details page says Quotas are reset every 24 hours. Next reset: 1 hours and now it's 8:30 am CET. All of the listed resources are rated Okay. If I go to the old Quota Detailsp page, though, I see that my requests' Frontend Instance Hourshave reached 100% and are rated Limited. So I went back to the new console under Compute / App Engine / Settings which showed Your budget today is $10.00. Effective tomorrow, you will be using only free quota. which I now increased to a daily budget of USD 5. My site now still shows the 503 error, but hopefully this will be the solution. I should be able to tell in 24 hours, shouldn't I? If anyone from Google App Engine is reading this, there might be some inconsistencies between the old and new panels that should probably be fixed.

@LINK:/questions/27235124/stackexchange-redis-deadlocking
@TITLE:StackExchange.Redis Deadlocking
@CONTENT:I'm using StackExchange.Redis (SE.R henceforth) in my Nancy application. There is a single global ConnectionMultiplexer that gets automatically passed around by Nancy's TinyIoC via constructor parameters, and any time I try and use GetDatabase and one of the *Async methods (sync methods only start failing after one of the async methods have been attempted) my application deadlocks. Looking at my parallel stacks it appears that I have four threads: The thread that called Result on one of my Tasks that uses SE.R. (Has lots of Nancy stuff on the stack, then a call to my library that utilizes SE.R, and a call to Result. Top of the stack is Monitor.Wait). A thread that spawned two other threads. I assume this is managed by SE.R. Starts with Native to Managed Transition, ThreadHelper.ThreadStart, and at the top of the stack is ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context. A small stack that is stuck like this: Monitor.Wait Monitor.Wait SocketManager.WriteAllQueues SocketManager.cctor.AnonymousMethod__16 Another small stack that looks like this: Managed to Native Transition SocketManager.ReadImpl SocketManager.Read SocketManager.cctor.AnonymousMethod__19 I'm almost sure this is a deadlock of some sort. I even think it might have something to do with this question. But I have no idea what to do about it. The ConnectionMultiplexer is set up in a Nancy IRegistrations with the following code: var configOpts =  new ConfigurationOptions {
  EndPoints = {
    RedisHost,
  },
  Password = RedisPass,
  AllowAdmin = false,
  ClientName = ApplicationName,
  ConnectTimeout = 10000,
  SyncTimeout = 5000,
};
var mux = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(configOpts);
yield return new InstanceRegistration(typeof (ConnectionMultiplexer), mux);
 mux is the instance that gets shared by all code requesting it in their constructor parameter list. I have a class called SchemaCache. A small piece of it (that includes the code that throws the error in question) follows: public SchemaCache(ConnectionMultiplexer connectionMultiplexer) {
    ConnectionMultiplexer = connectionMultiplexer;
}

private ConnectionMultiplexer ConnectionMultiplexer { get; set; }

private async Task<string[]> Cached(string key, bool forceFetch, Func<string[]> fetch) {
    var db = ConnectionMultiplexer.GetDatabase();

    return forceFetch || !await db.KeyExistsAsync(key)
        ? await CacheSetSet(db, key, await Task.Run(fetch))
        : await CacheGetSet(db, key);
}

private static async Task<string[]> CacheSetSet(IDatabaseAsync db, string key, string[] values) {
    await db.KeyDeleteAsync(key);
    await db.SetAddAsync(key, EmptyCacheSentinel);

    var keysSaved = values
        .Append(EmptyCacheSentinel)
        .Select(val => db.SetAddAsync(key, val))
        .ToArray()
        .Append(db.KeyExpireAsync(key, TimeSpan.FromDays(1)));
    await Task.WhenAll(keysSaved);

    return values;
}

private static async Task<string[]> CacheGetSet(IDatabaseAsync db, string key) {
    var results = await db.SetMembersAsync(key);
    return results.Select(rv => (string) rv).Without(EmptyCacheSentinel).ToArray();
}

// There are a bunch of these public methods:
public async Task<IEnumerable<string>> UseCache1(bool forceFetch = false) {
    return await Cached("the_key_i_want", forceFetch, () => {
        using (var cnn = MakeConnectionToDatabase("server", "databaseName")) {
            // Uses Dapper:
            return cnn.Query<string>("--expensive sql query").ToArray();
        }
    });
}
 I also have a class that makes uses of this in a method requiring some of the information from the cache: public OtherClass(SchemaCache cache) {
    Cache = cache;
}

private SchemaCache Cache { get; set; }

public Result GetResult(Parameter parameter) {
    return Cache.UseCache1().Result
        .Where(r => Cache.UseCache2(r).Result.Contains(parameter))
        .Select(r => CheckResult(r))
        .FirstOrDefault(x => x != null);
}
 All of the above works fine in LinqPad where there's only one instance of everything in question. Instead it fails with a TimeoutException (and later an exception about no available connection). The only difference is that I get an instance of the cache via dependency injection, and I'm pretty sure Nancy uses Tasks to parallelize the requests.

@TITLE:RealmObject AND Parcelable
@CONTENT:I'm new to Realm for Android so I'm not sure I'm approaching this the right way. I have a class which looks like this: public class Entry extends RealmObject implements Parcelable {
    ...
}
 The problem is the Parcelable interface contains methods like describeContents() writeToParcel() and RealmObjects aren't supposed to have methods other than getters and setters: Error:(81, 17) error: Only getters and setters should be defined in model classes
 So my question is: How can I make these two work together? Is there a better way than creating an separate class (maybe something like RealmEntry)? Doing so would result in a lot of duplicated code...

@TITLE:Shadow effects on ImageView in iOS
@CONTENT:I am trying to provide a shadow effect to my Imageview just like in this image. but the problem which I am facing it is that the shadow is actually visible from the bottom of the Imageview. Here is the code which I have done to add the shadow. The color and all is still not matching with this one.           CAGradientLayer *shadow = [CAGradientLayer layer];
          shadow.frame = CGRectMake(-100, 70, perspectiveView.frame.size.width, 
           perspectiveView.frame.size.height - 20);
          shadow.startPoint = CGPointMake(1.0, 0.5);
           shadow.endPoint = CGPointMake(0, 0.5);
           shadow.colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:(id)[[UIColor colorWithWhite:0.0 
           alpha:0.4f] CGColor], (id)[[UIColor clearColor] CGColor], nil];

          shadow.opacity = 1.0f;
          [perspectiveView.layer addSublayer:shadow];
 Please provide inputs. Also if the approach is wrong, feel free to guide me to any other approach. Thanks in advance. Also can anyone suggest how to provide a 3D border just like in the image which provides a slight width to the image view?

@TITLE:How to create a promotion code for iOS in-app purchases
@CONTENT:As of about May 2014 this year, searching Google for "ios in app purchase promotion code", yields lots of news sites reporting the same thing - Apple seem to be working on allowing promotion codes for testing in-app purchases as evidenced by a screenshot from EA games. My question is; does anybody know how to do this yet? I logged into the new iTunesConnect interface but can't find any link and nothing appears in the Apple docs from what I can find. Ideally I'm looking to create a code for a monthly subscription but they may only be allowed for consumables. With the lack of actual info on IAP promo codes my guess is that the feature hasn't been officially made available yet and that EA games were invited by Apple to test it out.

 I switched to default matching just to solve the problem, but I was wondering if anybody could elaborate on what this means exactly, and how this type of thing happens. I started on Git 2.0, so how does this apply to me?

@LINK:/questions/27214236/google-glass-eye-gesture-crashing-eyegesturelib
@TITLE:Google Glass Eye Gesture Crashing (EyeGestureLib)
@CONTENT:I am trying to check Wink from Glass using the EyeGestureLib. I created a new project and did exactly what the guy did with the sample project here. The problem part of my code is below: private EyeGestureManager mEyeGestureManager;
private EyeGestureListener mEyeGestureListener;

private EyeGesture target1 = EyeGesture.WINK;
private EyeGesture target2 = EyeGesture.DOUBLE_BLINK;
 Inside onCreate, I have:     mEyeGestureManager = EyeGestureManager.from(this);
    mEyeGestureListener = new EyeGestureListener();

    // print out each eye gesture is supported or not
    for (EyeGesture eg : EyeGesture.values()) {
        boolean supported = mEyeGestureManager.isSupported(eg);
        Log.d(TAG, eg.name() + ":" + supported);
    }
 My program crashes immediately after opening. I realize that the problem is when it tries to access mEyeGestureManager. Any where in the code that uses mEyeGestureManager will make the program crash.According to what I observed, mEyeGestureManager is null even after mEyeGestureManager = EyeGestureManager.from(this); When I change mEyeGestureManager = EyeGestureManager.from(this); to mEyeGestureManager = new EyeGestureManager();
 it stops crashing and mEyeGestureManager is no longer null but won't detect wink, or double wink. My glass was running XE21 but I downgraded it to XE18.3 because my research shows that EyeGestureLib wont work properly on Glass version > XE18.3. EyeGestures NOT working in 19.1 https://github.com/thorikawa/EyeGestureLib/issues/2 Now I have XE18.3 but it is not working. Wink is not working when I have mEyeGestureManager = new EyeGestureManager(); and I get: Supported:¡R BLINK:false
Supported:¡R DOFF:false
Supported:¡R DON:false
Supported:¡R DOUBLE_BLINK:false
Supported:¡R DOUBLE_WINK:false
Supported:¡R LOOK_AT_SCREEN:false
Supported:¡R LOOK_AWAY_FROM_SCREEN:false
Supported:¡R WINK:false
 But when I have: mEyeGestureManager = EyeGestureManager.from(this);
 it crashes right away. I went and installed already compiled example "EyeGestureDemo-debug-1.1.apk" and that WORKED very well but mine does not. What am I doing wrong? I have been trying to do this for 3 days now. Google doesn't have an official API for this but I don't want to wait till they release one. I need this for my school project ASAP. Anyone got any ideas of what might be the problem? EDIT: CRASH LOG 12-02 09:39:54.347    3758-3758/com.inno.inno.glassplugin D/AndroidRuntime¡R Shutting down VM

view
READ / Write / Update /Delete
 There are 10 Roles , 30 views like /user/view1 /user/view2 and then READ or write like These are on field level permissions like Field1 can be READ by Manager level on view 1
Field1 can be Edit by Manager level on view 2
Feild1 can be Delete by Admin on View 1
 I am confused how can i have that sort of permission model.

Obviously, since mtry is a number of variables chosen randomly, it has to be an integer, however I saw many examples on the net using stepFactor=1.5. At first I thought that R uses by default next mtry equal to floor(mtry_current-stepFactor), but it turned out that I was wrong. Moreover, I do not understand the R commands displaying search left... search right... while tuneRF is working. I thought it was the information on either inflating or deflating the mtry parameter but my suppositions did not turn out to be correct. To sum up this long and not too graceful description of my doubts, my questions are: why is stepFactor NOT an integer number?? How are subsequent mtry values chosen? What searching left/right actually mean?? Any help would be very much appreciated!! :)
@CODE:stepFactor tuneRF mtry randomForest tuneRF stepFactor mtry mtry stepFactor=1.5 mtry floor(mtry_current-stepFactor) search left... search right... tuneRF mtry stepFactor mtry tuneRF randomForest mtry

@TITLE:Media style notification not working after update to Android 5.0
@CONTENT:I tried implementing the Media Style Notification using this link. However when I recently updated to Android 5.0 SDK, the createSession method is not working. mMediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
mManager = (MediaSessionManager) getSystemService(Context.MEDIA_SESSION_SERVICE);
mSession = mManager.createSession("sample session"); //shows compile error
mController = MediaController.fromToken( mSession.getSessionToken() );
 Is there any other method that needs to be used? When I checked the change log, it said that createSession is no longer used. What are the alternatives then for implementing such media style notifications.
@CODE:Media Style Notification createSession mMediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
mManager = (MediaSessionManager) getSystemService(Context.MEDIA_SESSION_SERVICE);
mSession = mManager.createSession("sample session"); //shows compile error
mController = MediaController.fromToken( mSession.getSessionToken() ); createSession MediaSession MediaSession.getSessionToken

@TITLE:Lift to fix the *inside* of a monad transformer stack
@CONTENT:Suppose I have an IO Int wrapped in a StateT MyState, then I have a value of State MyState Int which I want to use in the stacked monad. How do I lift it in this inner sense? I already know to use lift or liftIO if I get something compatible with the inside that I just need to lift to the outside monad, but now I have the opposite problem: the value is already in the outer monad but not the inner one. For instance: checkSame :: State MyState a -> IO a -> StateT MyState IO Bool
checkSame sim real = do
  rres <- liftIO real
  sres <- ??? sim 
  return $ rres == sres
 Do I have to 'get' the state, shove it through runState by hand and box it all up again, or is there some generic way to do this? BTW, that sim parameter is a whole bunch of stateful functions that have nothing to do with IO, so I'm a bit reluctant to make them all return StateT MyState IO a if I can avoid it.
@CODE:IO Int StateT MyState State MyState Int lift liftIO checkSame :: State MyState a -> IO a -> StateT MyState IO Bool
checkSame sim real = do
  rres <- liftIO real
  sres <- ??? sim 
  return $ rres == sres StateT MyState IO a mapStateT (return . runIdentity) hoist (return . runIdentity) mmorph generalize generalize = return . runIdentity

@TITLE:Smart ordering Localized.strings file
@CONTENT:In my Localizable.Strings I try to have all pairs in alphabetical order. Is it possible to reorder them alphabetically my Localizable.strings? Maby using genstring or special bash script? Here I have additional requirements to complete: 1. Ordering should be case insensitive. 2. First X (e.g. five) lines should be copied, not ordered. This requirement should be met because in Localized.strings file I have author, company name and product name as a comment on top. 3. Keep comments I want to keep comments to the translated strings and keep new lines between each translation. This comments are generetad by special genstrings command for iOS developers (e.g. find ./ -name "*.m" -print0 | xargs -0 genstrings -o en.lproj find all NSLocalizedString(@"Param",@"Comment") in my code and generate pairs /* Comment */ /r/n "Param" = "Param"; to file). Comment line before translation is optional and may have only 1 line . For example file: /* This is Billy */
"Billy" = "The smartest guy in the univererse";

/* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy */
"42" = "the answer to life the universe and everything";

"Johny" = "Johny";

/* Optional field */
"Anny" = "Anny";
 The output should be: /* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy */
"42" = "the answer to life the universe and everything";

/* Optional field */
"Anny" = "Anny";

/* This is Billy */
"Billy" = "The smartest guy in the univererse";

"Johny" = "Johny";
 This question is the more sophisticated variant ot my own question that you can find here: Reorder .strings file
@CODE:Localizable.Strings Localizable.strings find ./ -name "*.m" -print0 | xargs -0 genstrings -o en.lproj NSLocalizedString(@"Param",@"Comment") /* Comment */ /r/n "Param" = "Param"; /* This is Billy */

@TITLE:Anonymous function with dplyr::do - using results from rle to filter data
@CONTENT:I have time series data grouped by subject ('id'), which stay on certain 'site' and have a certain 'stage' in each 'time' step. Sometimes subjects switch from one site to another, and possibly back again. If individuals switch site back and forth (e.g. from site 'a' to site 'b', and then back to site 'a') and if there is only one registration on the middle site (in a transition a-b-a, then site 'b' would here be considered a 'middle site') and the individual is in a certain stage (here, stage = 2) at the middle site, then I wish to remove the registration at this time step. My dummy data consists of four subjects. Three of them (subject 1-3) have moved from site a to b, and then back to site b, and one has moved from a to b. The first two subjects both have a single registration on the middle site. Subject 1 is in stage 1 on the middle site and I wish to keep that registration. Subject 2 on the other hand is in stage 2 on the middle site and this registration should be removed. Subject 3, has also moved back and forth between a and b. However, although it is in stage 2 on the middle site b, it has two registrations there and both registrations are kept. Subject 4 has moved from site a to b, but not back again. Thus, although it is in stage 2 on site b, the registration on site b is not a 'middle site' and should be kept. The data: df <- structure(list(id = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4),
                     time = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L),
                     site = c("a", "b", "a", "a", "b", "a", "a", "b", "b", "a", "a", "b"),
                     stage = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2)),
                     .Names = c("id", "time", "site", "stage"),
                row.names = c(NA, -12L), class = "data.frame")

df

#    id time site stage
# 1   1    1    a     1
# 2   1    2    b     1 <~~ A single middle registration on site 2
# 3   1    3    a     1     However, the individual is in stage 1: -> keep 

# 4   2    1    a     1
# 5   2    2    b     2 <~~ A single middle registration on site 2 with stage 2: -> remove
# 6   2    3    a     1

# 7   3    1    a     1
# 8   3    2    b     2 <~~ Two middle registrations with stage 2: -> keep both rows 
# 9   3    3    b     2 <~~
# 10  3    4    a     1

# 11  4    1    a     1

#                            but it is not in between two sites: -> keep
 Thus, in the test data, it is only the registration at time = 2 for id = 2 which should be removed. Previously, I have used plyr::ddply and result from rle to solve the problem: For each individual, calculate run lengths of site (rle(x$site)) If: - back and forth between sites (e.g. from a to b, and back to a) (length(r$values) > 2) & - only one registration on middle site (r$lengths[2] == 1) & - stage on middle site is 2 (x$stage[x$site == r$values[2]][1] == 2) Then: remove registration on middle site x[!(x$site == r$values[2]), ]) library(plyr)

ddply(df, .(id), function(x){
  r <- rle(x$site)
  if(length(r$values) > 2 & r$lengths[2] == 1 & x$stage[x$site == r$values[2]][1] == 2){
    x[x$site != r$values[2], ]
  } else x
})

#    id time site stage
# 1   1    1    a     1
# 2   1    2    b     1
# 3   1    3    a     1

# 4   2    1    a     1 <~~ the single middle site with stage = 2 at time 2 is removed
# 5   2    3    a     1 <~~

# 6   3    1    a     1
# 7   3    2    b     2
# 8   3    3    b     2
# 9   3    4    a     1

  group_by(id) %>%

    if(length(r$values) > 2 & r$lengths[2] == 1 & df$stage[df$site == r$values[2]][1] == 2){
    filter(x, x$site != r$values[2])
  } else x
})(.))
# desired row is not removed

    if(length(r$values) > 2 & r$lengths[2] == 1 & df$stage[df$site == r$values[2]][1] == 2){
      x[!(x$site == r$values[2]), ]
    } else x
  })
# Error: Results are not data frames at positions: 1, 2, 3
 This attempt happens to work (gives same result as ddply above), but is very far from elegant, and I doubt it's 'the right way': df %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  do(r = rle(.$site)) %>%  
  do(data.frame(id = .$id,
                len = length(.$r$values),
                site = .$r$values[2],
                len2 = .$r$lengths[2])) %>%
  filter(len == 3, len2 == 1) %>%
  select(-len) %>%
  left_join(df, ., by = c("id", "site")) %>%
  filter(!(len2 %in% 1 & stage == 2)) %>%
  select(-len2)

@TITLE:NHibernate 4 upgrade - Cannot simultaneously fetch multiple bags
@CONTENT:I tried to upgrade NH 3.3.1.4000 to the latest version NH 4.0.2.4000 and I had an issue with FetchMany and ThenFetchMany.

@TITLE:Get ANSI color for character at index
@CONTENT:I have developed couleurs NPM package which can be set to append rgb method to String.prototype: > console.log("Hello World!".rgb(255, 0, 0)) // "Hello World!" in red
Hello World!
undefined
> "Hello World!".rgb(255, 0, 0)
'\u001b[38;5;196mHello World!\u001b[0m'
 This works fine. What's the proper way to get the ANSI color/style of character at index i? Probably this can be hacked with some regular expressions, but I'm not sure if that's really good (however, if a correct implementation is available I'm not against it)... I'd prefer a native way to get the color/style by accessing the character interpreted by tty. > function getStyle (input, i) { /* get style at index `i` */ return style; }

> getStyle("Hello World!".rgb(255, 0, 0), 0); // Get style of the first char
{
   start: "\u001b[38;5;196m",
   end: "\u001b[0m",
   char: "H"
}
> getStyle("Hello " + "World!".rgb(255, 0, 0), 0); // Get style of the first char
{
   start: "",
   end: "",
   char: "H"
}
 Things get complicated when we have multiple combined styles: > console.log("Green and Italic".rgb(0, 255, 0).italic())
Green and Italic
undefined
> getStyle("Green and Italic".rgb(0, 255, 0).italic(), 0);
{
   start: "\u001b[3m\u001b[38;5;46m",
   end: "\u001b[0m\u001b[23m",
   char: "G"
}
> getStyle(("Bold & Red".bold() + " but this one is only red").rgb(255, 0, 0), 0);
{
   start: "\u001b[38;5;196m\u001b[1m",
   end: "\u001b[22m\u001b[0m",
   char: "B"
}
> getStyle(("Bold & Red".bold() + " but this one is only red").rgb(255, 0, 0), 11);
{
   start: "\u001b[38;5;196m",

'\u001b[38;5;196m\u001b[1mBold & Red\u001b[22m but this one is only red\u001b[0m'
 Like I said, I'm looking for a native way (maybe using a child process). So, how to get the complete ANSI style for character at index i?

@TITLE:R: Using values from data frame A from a date prior to populate a row in data frame B
@CONTENT:This may be very complicated and I suspect requires advanced knowledge. I have now two different types of data.frames I need to combine: The data: Dataframe A: lists all transfusion dates by patient ID. Every transfusion is represented by a separate row, patients can have multiple transfusions. Different patients can have transfusions on the same date. Patient ID Transfusion.Date
1          01/01/2000
1          01/30/2000
2          04/01/2003
3          04/01/2003
 Dataframes of Type B contain test results at other dates, also by patient ID: Patient ID  Test.Date   Test.Value
1           11/30/1999   negative
1           01/15/2000   700 copies/uL
1           01/27/2000   900 copies/uL
2           03/30/2003   negative
 What I would like to have is Dataframe A with the same number of rows (1 for each transfusion), and with the most recent Test.Value as a separate column. Each transfusion date should have the test result from the test performed most closely (prior) to the transfusion. desired output: --> Patient ID Transfusion.Date Pre.Transfusion.Test
1          01/01/2000       negative
1          01/30/2000       900 copies/ul
2          04/01/2003       negative
3          04/01/2003       NA
 I think the general strategy would be to subset the data.frames by patient IDs. Then take all transfusion dates for patient 1, check which result is closest to all available test_dates for each element and then return the value closest. How can I explain R to do that? Edit 1: Here is the R-code for these examples df_A <- data.frame(MRN = c(1,1,2,3), 
                   Transfusion.Date = as.Date(c('01/01/2000', '01/30/2000', 
                   '04/01/2003','04/01/2003'),'%m/%d/%Y')) 

df_B <- data.frame(MRN = c(1,1,1,2), 
                   Test.Date = as.Date(c('11/30/1999', '01/15/2000', '01/27/2000', 
                   '03/30/2003'),'%m/%d/%Y'), Test.Result = c('negative', 
                   '700 copies/ul','900 copies/ul','negative'))
 Edit 2: To clarify, the resulting data should be: Patient A received transfusions on Day X and Day Y. (for df_A). Prior to the transfusion on day X, his most recent test result was X (closest test date to first transfusion, in df_B). Prior to the transfusion on day Y, his most recent test result was Y (prior to the second transfusion, also in df_B. df_B also contains a bunch of other test dates, which are not needed for the final output.

@TITLE:Android 5 screen glitch/static with Google Maps Fragment inside a Viewpager
@CONTENT:I am having a strange issue related to Android 5 and Google Maps combined with a Viewpager and Fragments, hoping to get some good ideas from all of you.. Screenshot of the problem: http://postimg.org/image/6wzssbdbr/ (no rep for inlining yet) Situation: Main Activity with a Viewpager that has a number of Fragments One of the Fragments has a MapView inside it with all lifecycle methods forwarded; replace MapView with MapsFragment and the issue is the same Open a new Activity, as long as the new Activity is not using too much memory (I assume), the onDestroy of the Main Activity is not called and the glitch happens, if onDestroy is called, the glitch does not happen That second Activity has an input field for a card number and when this Activity is opened, I see the screenshot above. If I go back from the second Activity to the first I also get something strange, a bottom part of the screen is copied to the top and shown there with some static around it. Devices with Android 4 don't have the problem, I am targeting the latest SDK, using the latest build tools. If I remove the Fragment in the Viewpager with the Google Maps inside it, no issue. The only thing that did work is android:hardwareAccelerated='false' but as you might imagine this slows down the app.. Any suggestions/ideas are welcome.. I tried around 4-5 different things so far and only android:hardwareAccelerated works. Thanks for reading, Danny Edit: (Not enough rep to post more than 2 links, so links below without the code.google.com in front of it) Google code issues: My issue is reported here] -> /p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=7391 because I thought it was maps specific Similar issue found here -> /p/android/issues/detail?id=81832 reported in Android bugs Stackoverflow similar issue: Android SystemUI glitches

@TITLE:Converting python string object to c char* using ctypes
@CONTENT:I am trying to send 2 strings from Python (3.2) to C using ctypes. This is a small part of my project on my Raspberry Pi. To test if the C function received the strings correctly, I place one of them in a text file. Python code string1 = "my string 1"
string2 = "my string 2"

# create byte objects from the strings
b_string1 = string1.encode('utf-8')
b_string2 = string2.encode('utf-8')

# send strings to c function
my_c_function(ctypes.create_string_buffer(b_string1),
              ctypes.create_string_buffer(b_string2))
 C code void my_c_function(const char* str1, const char* str2)
{
    // Test if string is correct
    FILE *fp = fopen("//home//pi//Desktop//out.txt", "w");
    if (fp != NULL)
    {
        fputs(str1, fp);
        fclose(fp);
    }

    // Do something with strings..
}
 The problem Only the first letter of the string appears in the text file. I've tried many ways to convert the Python string object with ctypes. ctypes.c_char_p ctypes.c_wchar_p ctypes.create_string_buffer With these conversions I keep getting the error "wrong type" or "bytes or integer address expected instead of str instance". I hope someone can tell me where it goes wrong. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Changing a frame in viewDidLayoutSubviews
@CONTENT:When a view controller's view is first shown I want to run an animation in which all elements in the view controller slide from outside the bottom of the screen to their natural positions. To achieve this, I do subview.frame.origin.y += self.view.frame.size.height in viewDidLayoutSubviews. I also tried viewWillAppear, but it doesn't work at all. Then I animate them up to their natural positions with subview.frame.origin.y -= self.view.frame.size.height in viewDidAppear. The problem is that viewDidLayoutSubviews is called several times throughout the view controller's lifespan. As such, when things like showing the keyboard happen all my content gets replaced outside the view again. Is there a better method for doing this? Do I need to add some sort of flag to check whether the animation has already run? EDIT: here's the code. Here I'm calling prepareAppearance in viewDidLayoutSubviews, which works, but viewDidLayoutSubviews is called multiple times throughout the controller's life span. - (void)viewDidLayoutSubviews
{
    [super viewDidLayoutSubviews];
    [self prepareAppearance];
}

    self?.popOverView.center = gesture.locationInView(self?.view)
}
 Here [weak self] is to avoid reference cycle,and I also use trailing closure to simply the code.Howerver,the compiler is unhappy with that and gives me the wrong message. Cannot invoke 'animateWithDuration' with an argument list of type '(FloatLiteralConvertible, () -> () -> $T2)'
 What does $T2 stands for ? And the strange thing is that when there is two or more statements in the closure body, it compiles correctly. UIView.animateWithDuration(0.1) { [weak self] in
    println()
    self?.popOverView.center = gesture.locationInView(self?.view)
}
 And I know that if there is only one statement in the closure body, it is automatically returned.
@CODE:UIView.animateWithDuration(0.1) { [weak self] in

 I use Jackson for serializing/deserializing my POJOs into JSON, and my service both responds to and sends back my POJOs as application/json. I am now looking to possibly use Google protocol buffers (or an equivalent technology) to help compress/optimize the communication between client and service, as JSON/text is pretty bulky/wasteful. In reality, I have a large backend that consists of a "microservice" architecture; dozens of REST services communicating with each other; this is why I'm looking to optimize the the messages sent backk and forth between all of them. So I ask: is it possible to still have Jersey/JAX-RS serve up my service endpoints, but to gut out the Jackson/JSON stuff and replace it with Google protocol buffers? If so, what might this code look like?

@TITLE:How can I retain zero-length values during the $unwind phase of the aggregate pipeline in Mongo?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Mongo query using the aggregate pipeline. During the aggregation, I need to $unwind one of the fields. However, I don't want the $unwind to exclude entries that have zero-length arrays for that field, because I still need them further down the pipeline. My field is called items and it's an array of objects, which each contain two values: quantity and price. Here's a snippet of my Mongo query so far: db.MyCollection.aggregate([
    {$match: ... },
    {$project: ... },
    // put another $project here to retain zero-length values? how to format it?
    {$project: {
            _id: "$$ROOT",
            items: {
                $ifNull: [
                    {
                        $literal: {
                            quantity: 0,
                            price: 0
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    },
    {$unwind: "$items"},
    {$group: ... },
    {$project: ... },
    ...
]);
 As you can see, this already handles the case where a document doesn't have the items field present at all, in which case it adds it in and gives it an empty value to unwind on. What isn't handled, however, are documents that do already have that items field present, but it's blank. I was thinking I could use some combination of $cond and $size to check explicitly for a size of zero within another $project, and then substitute the same literal in that case, but $if expects a boolean so I'm not quite sure how to format that.
@CODE:$unwind $unwind items quantity price db.MyCollection.aggregate([
    {$match: ... },
    {$project: ... },

            _id: "$$ROOT",
            items: {

    },

@TITLE:Django 1.7.1 Makemigrations fails when using lambda as default for attribute
@CONTENT:I'm using Django 1.7.1. My model looks like this: from datetime import datetime
from django.db import models

class myModel(models.Model):
    x = models.CharField(max_length=254,null=True, blank=True,)
 Everything works perfectly fine. However, when I add the following attribute to myModel, it breaks:     y = models.DateTimeField(default=lambda: datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=1), editable=False)
 manage.py makemigrations gives me the following error: ValueError: Cannot serialize function: lambda
 This seems like a known bug: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.django.scm/125724 So how can I work around it? I need the value of y to be automatically set by default to 24 hours from the moment the model was created.

@LINK:/questions/27064678/laravel-eloquent-subquery
@TITLE:Laravel Eloquent subquery
@CONTENT:I have the following Eloquent query (This is a simplified version of a query which consists of of more wheres and orWheres hence the apparent roundabout way of going about this - the theory is what's important): $start_date = //some date;

$prices = BenchmarkPrice::select('price_date', 'price')
->orderBy('price_date', 'ASC')
->where('ticker', $this->ticker)
->where(function($q) use ($start_date) {

    // some wheres...

    $q->orWhere(function($q2) use ($start_date){
        $dateToCompare = BenchmarkPrice::select(DB::raw('min(price_date) as min_date'))
        ->where('price_date', '>=', $start_date)
        ->where('ticker', $this->ticker)
        ->pluck('min_date');

        $q2->where('price_date', $dateToCompare);
    });
})
->get();
 As you can see I pluck the earliest date that occurs on or after my start_date. This results in a seperate query being run to get this date which is then used as a parameter in the main query. Is there a way in eloquent to embed the queries together to form a subquery and thus only 1 database call rather than 2? Edit: As per @Jarek's answer this is my query: $prices = BenchmarkPrice::select('price_date', 'price')
->orderBy('price_date', 'ASC')
->where('ticker', $this->ticker)
->where(function($q) use ($start_date, $end_date, $last_day) {
    if ($start_date) $q->where('price_date' ,'>=', $start_date);
    if ($end_date) $q->where('price_date' ,'<=', $end_date);
    if ($last_day) $q->where('price_date', DB::raw('LAST_DAY(price_date)'));

    if ($start_date) $q->orWhere('price_date', '=', function($d) use ($start_date) {

        // Get the earliest date on of after the start date
        $d->selectRaw('min(price_date)')
        ->where('price_date', '>=', $start_date)
        ->where('ticker', $this->ticker);                
    });
    if ($end_date) $q->orWhere('price_date', '=', function($d) use ($end_date) {

        // Get the latest date on or before the end date
        $d->selectRaw('max(price_date)')
        ->where('price_date', '<=', $end_date)
        ->where('ticker', $this->ticker);
    });
});
$this->prices = $prices->remember($_ENV['LONG_CACHE_TIME'])->get();
 The orWhere blocks are causing all parameters in the query to suddenly become unquoted. E.g. WHEREprice_date>= 2009-09-07. When I remove the orWheres the query works fine. Why is this?
@CODE:where orWhere $start_date = //some date;

@TITLE:Baidu maps on Android: access key does not work for location searching
@CONTENT:I'm creating an Android app for a chinese client and they need map integration, so Google maps is not an option since all Google services are blocked in China. I'm trying to use Baidu maps, which is called Baidu LBS (location-based services) cloud. Getting a basic map with no overlays to work was relatively easy. The process is described here (in Chinese, but the code speaks for itself if you don't understand the language). Downloading the latest Baidu Android SDK (v3.2.0 at time of writing) and integrating it into my Eclipse project as a library was no problem, but don't trust the documentation in that link too much even though it is the official one. Their examples often contain code that wouldn't even compile. The name of the .jar file for example was completely different from what you see in their screenshot. Oh and also their .jar library is obfuscated which is super annoying to work with :-( I needed to register a Baidu account and go to their control center to generate a key. To create an access key ("ak") for mobile you need to enter the SHA1 fingerprint of the keystore which signs your app, followed by the package name specified in your manifest. Then I added the generated key to my manifest under the tag <meta-data android:name="com.baidu.lbsapi.API_KEY" android:value="xxx...xxx" />
 I then copied code from their sample project's CloudSearchActivity because I have specific coordinates that I would like to display. I implemented the CloudListener interface as shown: @Override
public void onGetSearchResult(final CloudSearchResult result, final int error)
{
    Log.w("onGetSearchResult", "status=" + result.status + ". size=" + result.size + ". total=" + result.total + ". error=" + error);
    if(null != result && null != result.poiList && 0 < result.poiList.size())
    {
      mBaiduMap.clear();
      final BitmapDescriptor bitmapDescriptor=BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource(R.drawable.icon_address_grey);
      LatLng latitudeLongitude;
      LatLngBounds.Builder builder=new Builder();
      for(final CloudPoiInfo info : result.poiList)
      {
        latitudeLongitude=new LatLng(info.latitude, info.longitude);
        final OverlayOptions overlayOptions=new MarkerOptions().icon(bitmapDescriptor).position(latitudeLongitude);
        mBaiduMap.addOverlay(overlayOptions);
        builder.include(latitudeLongitude);
      }
      final LatLngBounds bounds=builder.build();
      MapStatusUpdate mapStatusUpdate=MapStatusUpdateFactory.newLatLngBounds(bounds);
      mBaiduMap.animateMapStatus(mapStatusUpdate);
    }
}
 And I added code to launch a query (also copied from their sample project):   @Override
  public View onCreateView(final LayoutInflater layoutInflater, final ViewGroup viewGroup,
    final Bundle savedInstanceState)
  {
    // initialize needs to be called
    SDKInitializer.initialize(getApplication());
    CloudManager.getInstance().init(MyFragment.this);

    view=(ViewGroup)layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_map, viewGroup, false);

    mMapView=(MapView)view.findViewById(R.id.baiduMapView);
    mBaiduMap=mMapView.getMap();

    NearbySearchInfo info=new NearbySearchInfo();
    info.ak="xxx...xxx";
    info.geoTableId=12345;
    info.tags="";
    info.radius=30000;
    info.location="116.403689,39.914957";
    CloudManager.getInstance().nearbySearch(info);

    return view;
  }
 Unfortunately I keep getting a status value of 102 from the server (according to this API page that means STATUS_CODE_SECURITY_CODE_ERROR. Now I don't know what to do. Things that I don't understand: Why do I need to repeat my access key ("ak") when building the query? Is it not enough to have it in the manifest once? What is this "geoTableId" value in the query supposed to be? Any ideas?
@CODE:<meta-data android:name="com.baidu.lbsapi.API_KEY" android:value="xxx...xxx" /> @Override

I would love to understand some key points of the process: By the end of the day I need to transform my C code to a language that specifically my CPU should understand. So, who cares about knowing my CPU-specific instructions? The operating system? Is gcc converting any C to assembly language? I know (actually guess) that for each processor type I will need an assembler that will interpret (?) the assembly code and translate to my CPU specific instructions. Where is this assembler (who ships it)? Does it comes with the OS? Why exactly I can't see the 0s and 1s if I open the binary file with a text editor?

@CONTENT:I have 3 lists, a, b and c Each of this lists contains tuples with 3 numbers. Here is an example input: a = [(1,2,4),(1,7,8),(1,5,4),(3,6,7)]
b = [(1,2,5),(1,9,3),(1,0,3),(3,6,8)]
c = [(2,6,3),(2,4,9),(2,8,5),(1,2,7)]
 I'm looking for a way to generate a list that takes elements of those 3 lists if the two firsts items of eachs tuple are equals, and addind the third element. In the data I gave, there is only 1 set of tuple with the 2 first values equals : (1,2,4), (1,2,5) and (1,2,7). If I add their third value I have 4+5+7 = 16, so with those data, I should have [(1,2,16)] in the end. The two first values are uniques in each list, [(1,2,7),(1,2,15)] won't exist. The problem isn't finding tuples where only the two first values are equals, it's easyly done with a list comprehension. But I'm stuck on finding a pythonistic way to add the third value at the same time. I can make this: elem_list = []
for elem in a:
    b_elem = [i for i in b if i[:-1] == elem[:-1]]
    c_elem = [i for i in c if i[:-1] == elem[:-1]]
    if len(b_elem) != 0 and len(c_elem) != 0:
        elem_list.append((elem[0],elem[1], elem[2]+b_elem[0][2]+c_elem[0][2]))        
 That give me the desired output, but it's really long, and that's why I'm sure the is a pythonistic way to do this without trouble, I just can't figure it out.
@CODE:a b c a = [(1,2,4),(1,7,8),(1,5,4),(3,6,7)]

It's identical, except that there's some css: input:invalid{

 Except this time the orange border color is applied even before submit is pressed. So if and only if you manually set an invalid style for a form, the browser applies it before, which is not intuitive behavior. Of course a required field will invalid before you enter anything. Is there a way to fix this?

@TITLE:How-to make Hibernate Validator stop validation on the first field violation?
@CONTENT:I have a bean where I define multiple validation annotations for each field e.g. @NotEmpty
@Pattern(regexp="(\\-?\\d)+")
@Min(value=1)
String myField;
 I have encountered two one problem that I cannot resolve in any easy way. Validation order of the specified annotations for each field is random i.e. do not happen in the order the annotations are defined. I believe @GroupSequence will not help since it only defines group validation sequence, not annotation sequence. As @Tom correctly commented, violations are reported as Set which means there is no 1:1 mapping between execution order of annotations and reported violations. I want to invalidate only one rule for each field i.e. if it does not match pattern do not try to check if the value is >= 1. Currently if is set myField to "abc" it will report both @Pattern and @Min violations. Setting failFast property of a validator to true does not help because I'm using the same validator instance to validate all the fields in my bean, and it will stop validating other fields as soon as the first violation for the whole bean is encountered. Edit. I tried to implement custom composite constraint with @ReportAsSingleViolation. The problem is that it will report the same message for all violations involved in composition. This is not what I need. Suggestions, please?
@CODE:@NotEmpty
@Pattern(regexp="(\\-?\\d)+")

@TITLE:Why do I need the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission with getExternalCacheDir() on Android Lollipop?
@CONTENT:My app writes (and reads) cache files to the getExternalCacheDir() location. Before Android Lollipop (API 21) I've been using this permission with success: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" android:maxSdkVersion="18" />
 The maxSdkVersion is there because this permission shouldn't be needed after API v18: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE But on Android Lollipop (5.0) I'm getting an access permission like so (with my log output to show the actual path used): 11-19 13:01:59.257    4462-4541/com.murrayc.galaxyzoo.app E/android-galaxyzoo¡R     createCacheFile(): IOException for filename=/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.murrayc.galaxyzoo.app/cache/52

 I see this both in the emulator and on my Nexus 4. Has something changed, or was I doing something wrong all along? I just want to access my own app's cache. Update: I now see this only on my device (Nexus 4 running the standard Android 5.1.1, which has even had a fresh Android reflash since I first had this problem). I no longer see this in the emulator - of course the system images have been updated several times.

@CONTENT:We have TONS of websites hosted on Azure. Our VMs appear to be running now, but many of our Azure Websites are not. In an effort to bring our sites back up sooner than later, we have tried scaling UP, OUT, and changing our hosting plan, to no avail. Is there a way to force an Azure Website VM to move to another (working) datacenter? We don't want to destroy the site and bring it back up, as we will be forced to update DNS, which will cause an even longer delay in service to our customers. Any help is greatly appreciated.

According to some tutorial, I created a new target "testAppKit" as a shared dynamic framework, and target "testAppWidget" as today extension. The common code will be in testAppKit for reuse. Now I need to use third party libs in testAppKit. And added lib and header in build phases of testAppKit. Then I add #import <theLib/TheHeader.h> in testAppKit.h. But there is an error: Include of non-modular header inside framework module 'testAppKit'
 So, I want to know how to use third party libs (maybe in Swift or Objective-C) in this kind of embedded dynamic framework.

@TITLE:AngularJS: Using $compile on html that contains directives with templateurl
@CONTENT:I have a legacy application that has some content inserted into the DOM via jQuery. I would like the legacy parts of the codebase to be responsible for compiling the html that it inserts into the DOM. I can get it to compile the initial html using $compile, but any DOM elements added by a directive's template or templateUrl are not compiled, unless I call $scope.$apply() from within the directive itself. What am I doing wrong here? Link to fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/f3dkp291/15/ index.html <div ng-app="app">
    <debug source='html'></debug>

    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        template: "scope {{$id}} loaded from {{source}}",
        link: function($scope, el, attrs) {
          $scope.source = attrs.source

          if( attrs.autoApply ) {
              // this works
              $scope.$apply()
          }
        },
        scope: true
    }
})

// mimic an xhr request
setTimeout(function() {
    var html = "<div><debug source='xhr (auto-applied)' auto-apply='1'></debug><br /><debug source='xhr'></debug></div>",
        target = document.getElementById('target'),
        $injector = angular.injector(['ng','app']),
        $compile = $injector.get('$compile'),
        $rootScope = $injector.get('$rootScope'),
        $scope = angular.element(target).scope();

    target.innerHTML = $compile(html)($scope)[0].outerHTML

    // these do nothing, and I want to compile the directive's template from here.
    $scope.$apply()
    $scope.$root.$apply()
    angular.injector(['ng','app']).get('$rootScope').$apply()
}, 0)
 output scope 003 loaded from html
scope 005 loaded from xhr (auto-applied)

 Update: Solution works for directives with a template property, but not templateUrl So, I should have been compiling dom nodes, not an HTML string. However, this updated fiddle shows the same failing behavior if the directive contains a templateUrl: http://jsfiddle.net/trz80n9y/3/
@CODE:$compile $scope.$apply() <div ng-app="app">

@TITLE:Unexpected results on difference of unsigned ints
@CONTENT:I was surprised that this function produces different values for dif1 and dif2 void test()
{
    unsigned int x = 0, y = 1;
    long long dif1 = x - y;
    long long dif2 = (int)(x - y);
    printf("dif = %lld %lld",dif1,dif2);
}
 Is that correct behavior? In the dif1 computation it first promotes the 32-bit unsigned difference to a 64-bit unsigned value, then adds the sign. Is that standard behavior, not specified by the language, or a compiler bug? Is the second form guaranteed to produce -1, or up to the compiler implementation? I guess the safest construction is: long long dif3 = (long long)x - (long long)y;
@CODE:void test()
{
    unsigned int x = 0, y = 1;
    long long dif1 = x - y;
    long long dif2 = (int)(x - y);
    printf("dif = %lld %lld",dif1,dif2);

 My call to register the cors win the WebApiConfig.cs  config.EnableCors();
 config.SetCorsPolicyProviderFactory(new DynamicPolicyProviderFactory(Settings.Default.AllowedDomains));
 And my application settings being passed: <MyApp.Properties.Settings>

      <ArrayOfString xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

      </ArrayOfString>
    </value>
  </setting>
</MyApp.Properties.Settings>
 Despite these settings, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not present on my responses if I make a request from http://mg.domain1.com to http://localhost. I am using Web Api 2.2 and Microsoft.AspNet.Cors 5.2.2. edit: I have found that if I use the EnableCors attribute on the controller, or enable it globally (config.EnableCors(new EnableCorsAttribute("*", "*", "*"));) it works, so it must be something with my dynamic factory. The frustrating thing is, the DynamicPolicyProvider is copy/pasted from another project I am using that works fine. edit 2: Success!...I enabled tracing and found the error  The collection of headers 'accept,content-type' is not allowed
 So I just edited the GetPolicyForControllerAndOrigin method to allow them. Now everything works, accept I am confused because I did not have to jump through this hoop in my other project (the one I copied the DynamicPolicyProviderFactory from)

@TITLE:AMAZON AWS How do i subscribe an endpoint to SNS topic?
@CONTENT:I'm implementing push notifications in an iOS app using Amazon SNS and Amazon Cognito services. Cognito saves tokens successfully, my app gets notified, everything's working well, but there is a thing. Now, when still in development, I need to manually add endpoints to an SNS topic, so all subscribers can get notifications. When i'll push an update to the App Store, there will be thousands of tokens to add. I was studying Amazon AWS documentation, but there was no clue whether it's possible to make it happen without that additional effort. My question: is it possible to automatically subscribe an endpoint to a topic with Amazon services only?

@TITLE:Path variable not recognized in Android Studio (ndk-build command is not recognized)
@CONTENT:I have an Android Studio project which won't recognize the PATH variable set for ndk-build. If I run ndk-build from Terminal I get: stpns-MacBook-Pro:~ stepanboltalin$ ndk-build

 But if I try to compile project in Android Studio, I get error at 'ndk-build' commmandLine (below is the excerpt from build.gradle: task ndkBuild(type: Exec) {

    } else {

}
 Although the problem is seemingly solved, having build.gradle like that is sub-optimal for development. How can I fix this?

@LINK:/questions/26951431/how-to-get-an-observablefloatarray-from-a-stream
@TITLE:How to get an ObservableFloatArray from a Stream?
@CONTENT:This is nearly the same question as this one, but in the opposite direction. I know there's no FloatStream in Java 8, and there're no many use cases for float[], but I have one: Dealing with TriangleMesh in JavaFX 3D, you have to provide an ObservableFloatArray for the 3D coordinates of the vertices of the whole mesh. As a result of some calculations I'll have all these coordinates in a List, and to add all of them at once to the mesh, I'll call triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(), using one of the following methods: addAll(ObservableFloatArray src) addAll(float... elements) addAll(ObservableFloatArray src, int srcIndex, int length) addAll(float[] src, int srcIndex, int length) where ObservableFloatArray can be created using FXCollections.observableFloatArray(), FXCollections.observableFloatArray(ObservableFloatArray array) or FXCollections.observableFloatArray(float... values). Let's say I have this pojo for each vertex: private class Vertex {
    private final float x;
    private final float y;
    private final float z;

    public Vertex(float x, float y, float z){
        this.x=x; this.y=y; this.z=z;
    }

    public float[] getCoordenates(){
        return new float[]{x,y,z};
    }
}
 and after performing some calculations I have List<Vertex> listVertices. I'll need to generate float[] arrayVertices to finally call triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(arrayVertices);. For now this is what I'm doing: listVertices.forEach(vertex->triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(vertex.getCoordenates()));
 But this triggers the associated listener on every new vertex added to the observable array, and for high number of vertices this affects performance. Should FloatStream and flatMapToFloat() exist, I'd do something like this: float[] arrayVertices = listVertices.stream()
            .map(vertex->FloatStream.of(vertex.getCoordenates()))
            .flatMapToFloat(f->f).toArray();
triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(arrayVertices);
 like I actually do with a list of int[] for face indices: int[] arrayFaces = listFaces.stream()
            .map(face->IntStream.of(face.getFaceIndices()))
            .flatMapToInt(i->i).toArray();
triangleMesh.getFaces().addAll(arrayFaces);
 But as far as I know, there's no way using streams. Thanks in advance for any possible solution involving streams.
@CODE:FloatStream TriangleMesh ObservableFloatArray List triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll() ObservableFloatArray FXCollections.observableFloatArray() FXCollections.observableFloatArray(ObservableFloatArray array) FXCollections.observableFloatArray(float... values) private class Vertex {
    private final float x;
    private final float y;
    private final float z;

    public Vertex(float x, float y, float z){
        this.x=x; this.y=y; this.z=z;
    }

    public float[] getCoordenates(){
        return new float[]{x,y,z};
    }
} List<Vertex> listVertices float[] arrayVertices triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(arrayVertices); listVertices.forEach(vertex->triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(vertex.getCoordenates())); FloatStream flatMapToFloat() float[] arrayVertices = listVertices.stream()
            .map(vertex->FloatStream.of(vertex.getCoordenates()))
            .flatMapToFloat(f->f).toArray();
triangleMesh.getPoints().addAll(arrayVertices); int[] arrayFaces = listFaces.stream()
            .map(face->IntStream.of(face.getFaceIndices()))
            .flatMapToInt(i->i).toArray();

                         }];
 Essentially I'm looking for a Swift translation of this piece of code. In my actual app, I'm going to be posting a high score for a game (not liking a restaurant), but I should be able to figure that out if I have some Swift to work with. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:How to show frequencies in discrete categories with range data in R?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to sort out a bunch of data that I have about dinosaurs and their age ranges. So far, my data consists of a column of names, and then two columns of maximum and minimum dates in millions of years in the past, as you can see here: GENUS           ma_max  ma_min  ma_mid    
Abydosaurus     109     94.3    101.65

Acheroraptor    70.6    66.043  68.3215    
 Geological time is split into different ages (such as the Jurassic and Cretaceous) and these are also subdivided into stage. These stages have specific age ranges and I have made a dataframe to display these: Stage          ma_max ma_min ma_mid

 I'm trying to find out how many genus' are in each stage. Problem is the range - for example, a genus can have a range that spans 3 or more stages, and I want each of those stages to record the presence of a genus. Is there any simple way to do this? I thought about using 'shingle' from the lattice packages as suggested in a similar discussion on here, but I'm very new to R and not sure if it can be implemented in a way where data has range.

 And my controller: public class JobAdController extends Controller {
    public static Result save() {

        Form<Jobads> jobadsFormData = jobadsForm.bindFromRequest();
        if (jobadsFormData.hasErrors()) {
            System.out.println("Error in form");
            return badRequest();
        } else {
            Jobads.create(jobadsFormData.get());
            return redirect(controllers.routes.JobAdController.index());
        }
    }
}
 I don't have a variable for Jobads in Jobcategory model because I dont need it there. So a default table is created named jobads_jobcategories. My problem is that when I am trying to insert a data in jobads table it is inserted perfectly but the mapping ids are not saved in jobads_jobcategories table.

@TITLE:difference between thread/runnable, handler, runonuithread, asynctask
@CONTENT:i started learning android programming and am working on a small game. i heard that doing background operations or updates or downloading or what ever background and time consuming thing should not be done with ui thread and instead use thread/runnable or asynctask. but i cant do some things in threads like background connectivity to database where as this connectivity works with the remaining handler,runonuithread,asynctask.am greatly confused where to use which one. I have some questions 1.handler,runonuithread are both runs on ui thread, thread/runnable is a different thread and in async task, doinbackground method run on different thread and others methods like onprogressupdate,onpreexecute and onpostexecute run on ui thread. right? if that so i wrote a program to do database connectivity with thread/runnable it didnt worked but when i wrote it in doinbackground it worked. my confusin is that as both those methods run on different thread why this is happening. 2.what is the main difference btw those 4 and where are they applicable and not applicable. And also want to know what are the tasks which only ui thread can do. thanks in adv:)

@TITLE:With Mercurial, how do you hg log a branch with cross-branch ancestors?
@CONTENT:In Mercurial, I'm wanting to build a changelog of all commit messages for revisions my stable branch. Currently, I'm using: hg log -r <oldid>::<newid> where is the revision id of the changeset from the last time we pushed out code, and is stable's tip. This works great for code changes that are only on the stable branch, but if I'm merging another branch (such as a new major version which had its own development branch), all those commit messages are omitted! Instead I only get the 1 commit from where it merged into stable. I would like some way (preferably w/ hg log) to see these as well. I do NOT want to get any "unpublished" commits in this list - that is, commits on any branches which haven't been merged into stable. Here is an example of what I'm looking for: In this example, the last pushed revision is 540. Because of this, I don't want anything at 540 or below. There are several branches out into default and back in to stable, and I want all of these (539, 541-557 in green). However, there are some changes NOT merged back into stable (558-563) which I wish to omit. Pay special attention to Revision 539; it was NOT merged into stable when 540 was published, and therefore was not included. But now it has since been merged into stable, so I would like to include it! Any advice you guys have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Then when the process completes, Cipher.doFinal() will return all decoded bytes. First question is: Which bytes is it that are being buffered, number 1 or number 2 above? I assume the buffering occurs only during decryption and not encryption because firstly, the problems that arise from this buffering (shortly described) does not occur in my Java client doing the encryption of files read from the disk, it always occur on the server side, receiving those files and doing the decryption. Secondly, it is said so here. Judging only by my own experience, I can not be sure because my client uses a CipherOutputStream. The client does not explicitly use methods on the Cipher instance. Hence I can not deduce whether internal buffering is used or not because I can not see what the update- and final method return. My real problems arise when the encrypted files I transmit from client to server become large. By large I mean over 100 MB. What happens then is that Cipher.update() throw a OutOfMemoryError. Obviously due to the internal buffer growing and growing. Also, despite internal buffering and no result bytes received from Cipher.update(), Cipher.getOutputSize(int) continously report an ever growing target buffer length. Hence, my application code is forced to allocate an ever growing ByteBuffer that is feed into Cipher.update(ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer). If I try to cheat and pass in a byte buffer with a smaller capacity, then the update method throw a ShortBufferException #1. Knowing I create huge byte buffers for no use is quite demoralizing. Given that internal buffering is the root of all evil, then the obvious solution for me to apply here is to split the files into chunks, of say 1 MB each - I never have problems sending small files, only large ones. But, I struggle hard to understand why internal buffering happens in the first place. The previously linked SO answer says that GCM:s authentication tag is "added at the end of the ciphertext", but that it "does not have to be put at the end" and this practice is what "messes up the online nature of GCM decryption". Why is it that putting the tag at the end only messes up the server's job of doing decryption? Here is how my reasoning goes. To compute an authentication tag, or MAC if you will, the client use some kind of a hash function. Apparently, MessageDigest.update() does not use an ever growing internal buffer. Then on the receiving end, can not the server do the very same thing? For starters, he can decrypt the bytes, albeit unauthenticated ones, feed those into his update function of the hash algorithm and when the tag arrives, finish the digest and verify the MAC that the client sent. I'm not a crypto guy so please speak to me as if I am both dumb and crazy but loving enough to care some for =) I thank you wholeheartedly for the time taken to read through this question and perhaps even shed some light! UPDATE #1 I don't use AD (Associated Data). UPDATE #2 Wrote software that demonstrate AES/GCM encryption using Java, as well as the Secure Remote Protocol (SRP) and binary file transfers in Java EE. The front-end client is written in JavaFX and can be used to dynamically change encryption configuration or send files using chunks. At the end of a file transfer, some statistics about time used to transfer the file and time for the server to decrypt is presented. The repository also has a document with some of my own GCM and Java related research. Enjoy: https://github.com/MartinanderssonDotcom/secure-login-file-transfer/ #1 It is interesting to note that if my server who do the decryption does not handle the cipher himself, instead he use a CipherInputStream, then OutOfMemoryError is not thrown. Instead, the client manage to transfer all bytes over the wire but somewhere during the decryption, the request thread hang indefinitely and I can see that one Java thread (might be the same thread) fully utilize a CPU core, all while leaving the file on disk inaccessible and with a reported file size of 0. Then after a tremendously long amount of time, the Closeable source is closed and my catch clause manage to catch an IOException caused by: "javax.crypto.AEADBadTagException: Input too short - need tag". What render this situation weird is that transmitting smaller files work flawless with the exact same piece of code - so obviously the tag can be properly verified. The problem must have the same root cause as when using the cipher explicitly, i.e. an ever growing internal buffer. I can not track on the server how many bytes was successfully read/deciphered because as soon as the reading of the cipher input stream begin, then compiler reordering or other JIT optimizations make all my logging statements evaporate into thin air. They are [apparently] not executed at all. Note that this GitHub project and its associated blog post says CipherInputStream is broken. But the tests provided by this project does not fail for me when using Java 8u25 and the SunJCE provider. And as has already been said, everything work for me if only I use small files.

It works well for me till now. AsyncTask needs to onPostExecute UI Fragment Use setRetainInstance(true) UI-less fragment. Use setTargetFragment and getTargetFragment technique Please refer to http://stackoverflow.com/a/12303649/72437 AsyncTask needs to onPostExecute UI Activity Use setRetainInstance(true) UI-less fragment. Use onAttach and onDetach to store reference to Activity. Google seems doesn't encourage using getActivity. http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html Please refer to http://stackoverflow.com/a/16305029/72437 However, how about case for a class derived from View? I plan to launch AsyncTask from the custom View. However, how can I onPostExecute back to the View? The reason I'm asking so is, in my custom view, certain touch event will trigger it to redraw itself with a new bitmap. Generating the new bitmap is time consuming. Hence, I plan to launch a AsyncTask, to generate such bitmap, and pass back to custom View. However, configuration change might cause custom View to be recreated. Hence, I need to ensure my AsyncTask can have correct View reference during onPostExecute.

 I'm running this on a Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android KitKat. Thank you for reading this. Any help would be appreciated at this point. Update: For anyone reading this, I don't know why it worked like this, but I came upon the problem after following the below answer. I surrounded the actionBar layout with a RelativeLayout [with the LinearLayout and its contents as the children], and the width/background fixed itself... The answer is still amazing as its very clear cut and absolutely removes the actionBar, while before I was still using it in some way.

I have implemented a Callback interface between the Adapter and the ViewHolder Class to handle Click Events on the UI elements(buttons). I am having problems getting a reference to the ViewHolder that the click occurred in. I can click the Button for the first item in the list, however the action that i'd defined is performed on the last viewholder in my recycler view. I finally figured out to pass the position through my interface, but I'm struggling to understand how to get a reference to that viewholder from it.     public class RoomAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RoomAdapter.RoomViewHolder>
{
    List<Room> mRooms;
    public RoomAdapter(List<Room> rooms) {
        mRooms = rooms;
    }

    @Override
    public RoomViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup viewGroup, int i) {
        final View viewItem = LayoutInflater
                .from(viewGroup.getContext())
                .inflate(R.layout.room_rv_item,viewGroup,false);
        return vh = new RoomViewHolder(viewItem,new IRoomViewClick() {
            @Override
            public void editname(int pos) {

            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(RoomViewHolder roomViewHolder, int i) {
        Room r = getItem(i);
        roomViewHolder.label.setText(r.name);


    }
    public Room getItem(int position)
    {
        return mRooms.get(position);
    }

@TITLE:Struggling to retrieve csrf token from a cookiejar object
@CONTENT:I am using the code below based on this answer to store authentication cookies in a file. This allows me to avoid having to log in every time I run the program. Now, fetching the csrftoken from regular Session cookies works well, but when I try to fetch it from the cookiejar using csrf = s.cookies['csrftoken'], I get AttributeError: LWPCookieJar instance has no attribute '__getitem__'`
 I understand that this happens because I treat s.cookies as a list even though is now a LWPCookieJar object. I suppose this leaves me with two options: Either: Extract the list from the LWPCookieJar object and then getting the csrf token is easy. or, Find the appropriate syntax to retrieve the csrf token directly from the LWPCookieJar. How can I do this? import os
import requests
from cookielib import LWPCookieJar

s = requests.Session()
s.cookies = LWPCookieJar('cookiejar')
if os.path.exists('cookiejar'):
    # Load saved cookies from the file and use them in a request
    print('loading saved cookies')
    s.cookies.load()        
else:

r = s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies')

@TITLE:Add Trigger to Transition
@CONTENT:How does one add a trigger to the "Properties-Constraints-Triggers" area of a state machine transition in Enterprise Architect? The quotes are how you get there manually within EA. What I've Tried Below, this actually results in the trigger being added to the state machine, but I need to link it to a specific transition. Variable stateMachine is of type EA.Element. EA.Element trigger = (EA.Element)stateMachine.Elements.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");
 State is of type EA.Element. connector is of type EA.Connector (the specific StateFlow transition that I'm trying to add the trigger to). All of these appear to do absolutely nothing. In fact, Constraints seems to be an empty collection, even after I add the new items. state.Constraints.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");
connector.Constraints.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");
state.StateTransitions.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");
 I've dug through the EA help with no luck as well. The search functionality isn't so good though, so it's possible I've missed something. Interesting Information (May be on to something) The MiscData for the Connector type seems to have the State Flow trigger information. According to a very reliable book (thank you Mr. Kilian), PDATA1 of MiscData seems to be the State Flow trigger's name. But how do I add a new trigger? MiscData is Read Only.
@CODE:EA.Element trigger = (EA.Element)stateMachine.Elements.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger"); state.Constraints.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");
connector.Constraints.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");
state.StateTransitions.AddNew("trigger", "Trigger");

@TITLE:Textbox not clickable in TinyMCE modal box
@CONTENT:I'm developing a panel for a client which features a 'New Blog Post' button which opens up a modal and in that modal it is possible to click an 'Add image' box which opens another modal. The issue here is the fact that the 'Add image's' modal box contains text boxes which are supposed to be clickable however, these are not. I was experimenting with Z-Index's to see if that was the issue however, I had no luck with resolving the problem. These modals consist of Bootstrap and TinyMCE(for editing). It can be found here: http://olidev.me/testpanel/ : under the 'American site' tab, click 'Add Blog Post' and then click on the 'Insert' tab on tool bar in the 'Post' area and 'Insert image'. Sorry for the confusing access to this issue but hopefully its easily resolvable. EDIT: I tried another application called 'CKEDITOR' and the exact same problem occurred, is this due to the 3 modals overlapping eachother??

@TITLE:cross compile libgcrypt static lib for use on iOS
@CONTENT:I have downloaded latest libgcrypt & libgpg-error libraries from https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html. I have successfully built (command line) both libraries using ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared; make ; make install on my Mac (Mavericks w/OSX 10.10 & latest Xcode 6.1). I can link just fine to these new libs from an OS X client app I am building. So far, so good. Just perfect. BUT, I also need to build an iOS client using same exact source code. Questions: 1) What are the modifications to the command line build sequence for the library I would need to build a universal static library for the (simulator, Mac & iOS)? 2) Or do I need to build separate static libs for iOS? And if so, again, what command line magic would I need to accomplish getting the target architecture right?

@TITLE:200 Response but no JSON Data returned - Restangular issue?
@CONTENT:Using restangular and the stub hub api. I can hit this API on the firefox restclient and get a response body back with all the JSON data. But in my app, I get a 200 but no response body... the content length even says something's there albeit the api says you just need GET/URI endpoint and Authorization: Bearer {token} Here's my restangular config 'use strict';
angular.module('myapp')
.config(['RestangularProvider', function(RestangularProvider){
    RestangularProvider.setBaseUrl('https://api.stubhub.com/');
    RestangularProvider.setDefaultHeaders({

 and here's my controller $scope.searchEvents = function(){

        $scope.searchResponse = response;
    }, function(response){
        console.log("something went wrong");
    })
}
 How can I begin to debug? I want to keep using restangular so hopefully I can get around this somehow.

@TITLE:Clean up signatures with long implicit parameter lists
@CONTENT:Is there an elegant solution to somehow clean up implicit parameter lists making signatures more concise? I have code like this: import shapeless._
import shapeless.HList._
import shapeless.ops.hlist._
import shapeless.poly._

trait T[I, O] extends (I => O)

trait Validator[P]

object Validator{
  def apply[P] = new Validator[P]{}
}

object valid extends Poly1 {
  implicit def caseFunction[In, Out] = at[T[In, Out]](f => Validator[In])
}

object isValid extends Poly2 {
  implicit def caseFolder[Last, New] = at[Validator[Last], T[Last, New]]{(v, n) => Validator[New]}
}

object mkTask extends Poly1 {
  implicit def caseT[In, Out] = at[T[In, Out]](x => x)
  implicit def caseFunction[In, Out] = at[In => Out](f => T[In, Out](f))
}

object Pipeline {

  def apply[H <: HList, Head, Res, MapRes <: HList](steps: H)
       (implicit
        mapper: Mapper.Aux[mkTask.type,H, MapRes],
        isCons: IsHCons.Aux[MapRes, Head, _],
        cse: Case.Aux[valid.type, Head :: HNil, Res],
        folder: LeftFolder[MapRes, Res, isValid.type]
         ): MapRes = {
    val wrapped = (steps map mkTask)
    wrapped.foldLeft(valid(wrapped.head))(isValid)
    wrapped
  }
}

// just for sugar
def T[I, O](f: I => O) = new T[I, O] {
  override def apply(v1: I): O = f(v1)
}

Pipeline(T((x:Int) => "a") :: T((x:String) => 5) :: HNil) // compiles OK
Pipeline(((x:Int) => "a") :: ((x:String) => 5) :: HNil) // compiles OK

// Pipeline("abc" :: "5" :: HNil) // doesn't compile
// can we show an error like "Parameters are not of shape ( _ => _ ) or T[_,_]"?

//  Pipeline(T((x: Int) => "a") :: T((x: Long) => 4) :: HNil) // doesn't compile
// can we show an error like "Sequentiality constraint failed"?
 And I also want to add a couple of implicit params necessary for the library's functionality (to the Pipeline.apply method), but the signature is already huge. I am worried about the ease of understanding for other developers - is there a "best practice" way to structure these params? Edit: What I mean is the implicit parameters fall into different categories. In this example: mapper ensures proper content types, isCons, cse and folder ensure a sequential constraint on input, and I would like to add implicits representing "doability" of the business logic. How should they be grouped, is it possible to do in a readable format? Edit2: Would it be possible to somehow alert the library's user, as to which constraint is violated? E.g. either the types in the HList are wrong, or the sequentiality constraint is not held, or he lacks the proper "business logic" implicits?

@CONTENT:I need a view controller for user to crop and rotate image. And I think the UI which iOS8 photo app did is very awesome But I found only these two : https://github.com/heitorfr/ios-image-editor https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/PEPhotoCropEditor These are useful, but when making image smaller than the crop area, to move or rotate the image is very difficult, and the respond is very weird. After using these, I think the iOS8 photo app's crop and rotate function is much better So is there a view controller performs image crop and rotate like iOS 8 photo app?

 When I call this function form the plugin class. In the browser it shows the following error: You cannot access this page directly. ...and the URL in the address bar of the browser is something like this: http://zyx.com/oinmonm/plugins/sociallogin/hybridauth-2.1.2/hybridauth/?hauth.start=Facebook&hauth.time=1415168326 After searching stackoverflow I found a similar question that describes about similar problem, but I have not been able to figure out how to apply the suggestions there to my code fix the issue: You cannot access this page directly - HybridAuth Social Login Most probably the problem is with the different domain names, as my website is running on two different domains. How can I fix my code to prevent this issue? More Details I have a facebook link on www.bca.com(example) then when you click it goes to a controller.php file that will access the plugin that I am writing . Usually if I save a folder in the website like the plugin folder that is not accessible by www.bca.com instead its accessible by some other domain name . What I am trying to say is that the session is starting in bca.com but the Hybridauth classes are saved in some other domain . And I think this is the reason the error is coming. I tried to debug and found out the error is popping from following lines in Endpoint.php file // Check if Hybrid_Auth session already exist
if (! $storage->config("CONFIG")) { 
    header("HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found");
    die("You cannot access this page directly.");
}
 I have been trying to fix this from last 3 days . But I am stuck at this point plz some one help me out. Thanks in advance

However, a Pebble.js application I'm currently working on simply displays Disconnected - run the pebble phone app. I have noticed that in my Developer Settings that the Connection Manager is listed as Disconnected. Is this part of the problem? I see nothing in the logs. For reference, the application is doing a simple ajax request and displaying the result.

@TITLE:Can I pass a list of colors for points to matplotlib's 'Axes.plot()'?
@CONTENT:I've got a lot of points to plot and am noticing that plotting them individually in matplotlib takes much longer (more than 100 times longer, according to cProfile) than plotting them all at once. However, I need to color code the points (based on data associated with each one) and can't figure out how to plot more than one color for a given call to Axes.plot(). For example, I can get a result similar to the one I want with something like fig, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()
rands = numpy.random.random_sample((10000,))
for x in range(10000):
    ax.plot(x, rands[x], 'o', color=str(rands[x]))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
 but would rather do something much faster like fig, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()
rands = numpy.random.random_sample((10000,))
# List of colors doesn't work
ax.plot(range(10000), rands, 'o', color=[str(y) for y in rands])
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
 but providing a list as the value for color doesn't work in this way. Is there a way to provide a list of colors (and for that matter, edge colors, face colors , shapes, z-order, etc.) to Axes.plot() so that each point can potentially be customized, but all points can be plotted at once? Using Axes.scatter() seems to get part way there, since it allows for individual setting of point color; but color is as far as that seems to go. (Axes.scatter() also lays out the figure completely differently.)
@CODE:Axes.plot() fig, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()
rands = numpy.random.random_sample((10000,))
for x in range(10000):
    ax.plot(x, rands[x], 'o', color=str(rands[x]))
matplotlib.pyplot.show() fig, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()
rands = numpy.random.random_sample((10000,))
# List of colors doesn't work
ax.plot(range(10000), rands, 'o', color=[str(y) for y in rands])
matplotlib.pyplot.show() color Axes.plot() Axes.scatter() Axes.scatter() mark mark scatter plot ax.plot() for ... ax.plot() ax.scatter() scatter plot ax plot set

@CONTENT:The scipy.integrate.ode interface to integration routines provides a method for stopping the integration if a constraint is violated at any step, set_solout. However, I cannot get this method to work, even in the simplest examples. Here's one attempt: import numpy as np

    return -y

r.set_solout(solout)

# Integrate until t = 5, but stop when solout constraint violated
r.integrate(5)

# The time when solout should have terminated integration:
intersection_time = np.log(2)
 The integration should have been stopped by solout when t = log(2) = 0.693..., but instead happily continues until t = 5, when y = 0.007. Is this a bug in scipy, or am I not using set_solout correctly?

@CONTENT:I have multiple threads writing data to a common source, and I would like two threads to block each other if and only if they are touching the same piece of data. It would be nice to have a way to lock specifically on an arbitrary key: string id = GetNextId();
AquireLock(id);

 If nobody else is trying to lock the same key, I would expect they would be able to run concurrently. I could achieve this with a simple dictionary of mutexes, but I would need to worry about evicting old, unused locks and that could become a problem if the set grows too large. Is there an existing implementation of this type of locking pattern.

@LINK:/questions/26722715/javascript-static-singelton-this-vs-this-vs-object-name
@TITLE:Javascript static/singelton - this vs _this vs object name
@CONTENT:This is a question about performance and best practice. Assuming I have a js object that encapsulates a large number of helper methods. The object is being treated as a static class, meaning it is never instantiated and all its methods are basically helper methods. When using events and jQuery, the object's this scope keeps changing, and since it has a fairly large number of methods I am wondering what is best practice - saving this into _this at the beginning of each method or simply use the object name MyObject. Over the years I've been doing both, when it comes to singelton/static objects, but I figured there must be just 1 best practice and it's about time to adopt the best approach. My current research shows that the benefits that come with using _this instead of directly calling MyObject are mainly these two: if the object's name changes, _this will always work May be faster (although haven't seen performance testing results) since the browser stays in the same scope and does not need to find out the scope of MyObject every time. Pros of using MyObject: Less code to write. Garbage collection management? (less variables to assign) May be more readable for some developers (where multiple this apply) Easier to refactor code since MyObject will always work I would like to know if there is a way of globally saving _this (only inside the object's scope of course) and avoid assigning it at the beginning of each method. If not - are there other pros/cons that I am missing or is it considered bad practice to call the object name directly. This is a simplified object for reference (real object has many more methods).     var MyObject = {
       init: function() {

         this.registerEvents();
         //other stuff

 Deleting from my recyclerview gives unexpected results sometimes. Sometimes the element ahead of the one clicked is deleted, other times an indexOutOfBounds exception occurs at "taskList.get(position)". Reading https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html and https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html did not give me any more insight into why this was happening and how to fix it. It looks like RecyclerView recycles the rows, but I wouldn't expect an indexoutofbounds exception using a smaller subset of numbers to index my list.
@CODE:public class TaskAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<TaskAdapter.TaskViewHolder>   {

private List<Task> taskList;
private TaskAdapter thisAdapter = this;

// cache of views to reduce number of findViewById calls
public static class TaskViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
    protected TextView taskTV;
    protected ImageView closeBtn;

    public TaskViewHolder(View v) {
        super(v);
        taskTV = (TextView)v.findViewById(R.id.taskDesc);
        closeBtn = (ImageView)v.findViewById(R.id.xImg);
    }
}


public TaskAdapter(List<Task> tasks) {
    if(tasks == null)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("tasks cannot be null");
    taskList = tasks;
}


// onBindViewHolder binds a model to a viewholder
@Override
public void onBindViewHolder(TaskViewHolder taskViewHolder, int pos) {
    final int position = pos;
    Task currTask = taskList.get(pos);
    taskViewHolder.taskTV.setText(currTask.getDescription());

    **taskViewHolder.closeBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            Log.d("TRACE", "Closing task at position " + position);
            // delete from SQLite DB
            Task taskToDel = taskList.get(position);
            taskToDel.delete();
            // updating UI
            taskList.remove(position);
            thisAdapter.notifyItemRemoved(position);
        }
    });**
}

@LINK:/questions/26694955/properly-force-or-allow-landscape-mode-for-youtube-embedded-video-in-ios-8-witho
@TITLE:Properly force or allow Landscape mode for Youtube embedded video in iOS 8 without NSNotificationCenter
@CONTENT:I am having issues of capturing when the youtube player will enter in fullscreen or exit fullscreen in iOS 8 because these notifications were removed UIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotification and UIMoviePlayerControllerWillExitFullscreenNotification for this version OS version. Because my app project is set to be only in portrait mode the video won't rotate to landscape mode when is playing which is really not too user friendly when watching a video on your device. Usually the user would like to watch the video either in portrait mode or landscape mode when the video enters in fullscreen. These is the way I was doing it for iOS 7 which was working perfect but not in iOS 8. First, I will set this function in my AppDelegate.m with boolean property in my AppDelegate.h which I called videoIsInFullscreen and function, // this in the AppDelegate.h
@property (nonatomic) BOOL videoIsInFullscreen;


// This in my AppDelegate.m to allow landscape mode when the boolean property is set to yes/true.
- (NSUInteger)application:(UIApplication *)application supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:(UIWindow *)window{
    if(self.videoIsInFullscreen == YES)
    {
        return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAllButUpsideDown;
    }
    else
    {
        return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait;
    }
}
 Then within my ViewController.m First, I would #import "AppDelegate.h" after doing this, I will add some notifications in my viewDidLoad method.. -(void)viewDidLoad {

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(playerStarted) name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotification" object:nil];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(playerEnded) name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerWillExitFullscreenNotification" object:nil];

}
 Of course don't forget to remove them.. -(void)dealloc {

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotification" object:nil];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerWillExitFullscreenNotification" object:nil];

}
 Then, I had my functions that will get call when these notifications get fires... Here is where I allow the landscape mode and then set it back to portrait. These is the case with my app because it's only set to portrait support but I don't want this for the youtube videos. // first we set our property in the our AppDelegate to YES to allow landscape mode
- (void)playerStarted
{
    ((AppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]).videoIsInFullscreen = YES;

    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientation:UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait animated:NO];
}

// Then I will set the property to NO and force the orientation to rotate to portrait.
- (void)playerEnded
{       
    ((AppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]).videoIsInFullscreen = NO;

    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientation:UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait animated:NO];
}
 But, these is not the case for iOS 8.. These notifications no longer work for iOS 8 so, I found something similar using these notifications but I am not too happy because they are not 100% accurate for the video player. UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification and UIWindowDidBecomeHiddenNotification So, how can I do this correctly or at least that works properly for my youtube embedded video and allow landscape mode in iOS 8...?
@CODE:UIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotification UIMoviePlayerControllerWillExitFullscreenNotification AppDelegate.m AppDelegate.h videoIsInFullscreen // this in the AppDelegate.h
@property (nonatomic) BOOL videoIsInFullscreen;


// This in my AppDelegate.m to allow landscape mode when the boolean property is set to yes/true.
- (NSUInteger)application:(UIApplication *)application supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:(UIWindow *)window{
    if(self.videoIsInFullscreen == YES)
    {
        return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAllButUpsideDown;
    }
    else
    {
        return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait;
    }
} ViewController.m #import "AppDelegate.h" viewDidLoad -(void)viewDidLoad {

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(playerStarted) name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotification" object:nil];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(playerEnded) name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerWillExitFullscreenNotification" object:nil];

} -(void)dealloc {

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotification" object:nil];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:@"UIMoviePlayerControllerWillExitFullscreenNotification" object:nil];

} // first we set our property in the our AppDelegate to YES to allow landscape mode

    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientation:UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait animated:NO];

@CONTENT:Wondering if someone can explain the current behavior. I have one directive with isolate scope, call it dirA. I then put another directive on it, dirB. Expecting the second directive to get each scope that the isolate directive creates. dirB gets the controller scope. Why would it not get the same isolate scope that dirA is creating for that element? Thanks for any help. I don't really have any code for this, just curious. If anyone needs two little directives and some html to help visualize i will of course. thank you.

@LINK:/questions/26691357/aligning-a-recyclerview-below-a-linearlayout
@TITLE:Aligning a RecyclerView below a LinearLayout
@CONTENT:I have a linear layout called "footer" I want to place below my RecyclerView (a new type of list introduced in API 21). The recyclerview will probably want to have a "match_parent" height to efficiently use memory (avoid unecessary calculation). I shouldn't have the recyclerview first because then it will take up the whole screen and the footer wont be visible. Since the recyclerview comes second the linearlayout shouldn't have a "match_parent" height, because then the recyclerview won't be seen, and I don't need the footer to stretch anyways. So I have the linearlayout "footer", a height first in my root relativelayout, then the recyclerview will be "match_parent", and specified above the "footer": <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

@CONTENT:I want to hide the soft keyboard when the Enter key is tapped, but no solutions works for me properly. (Windows Phone 8.1 Universal App) This one just doesn't work: if (e.Key == VirtualKey.Enter)
{
    textBox.IsEnabled = false;
    textBox.IsEnabled = true;
}
 A method like this: private void LoseFocus(object sender)
{
    var control = sender as Control;
    var isTabStop = control.IsTabStop;
    control.IsEnabled = false;
    control.IsTabStop = false;
    control.IsEnabled = true;
    control.IsTabStop = isTabStop;
}
 works only partially. It's hiding keyboard only when I'm using textbox for the first time. On the second time keyboard is reappearing.
@CODE:if (e.Key == VirtualKey.Enter)
{
    textBox.IsEnabled = false;
    textBox.IsEnabled = true;
} private void LoseFocus(object sender)
{
    var control = sender as Control;

    control.IsEnabled = false;

@TITLE:Xcode 6.1: UIViews disappearing in interface builder when adjusting frames
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to Interface Builder and I'm trying to practice it with a very simple view. Basically, I have 3 UIViews on my view controller. The problem I am having is that whenever I adjust the frame of 1 of the UIViews, the other 2 will disappear. Here is a short 7 second video of the problem: https://vine.co/v/OMlbMIdWMe5 If I run the app on my device, I only see 1 of the views (the 1 I was adjusting) - the other 2 remain hidden. I am using Xcode 6.1 . What could be causing this? ***EDIT: If I add 1 constraint to a view, it won't disappear when I readjust the frame of the other view. That is: Add a constraint to ViewOne then readjusting size of ViewTwo will only cause ViewThree (without any constraints) to disappear. So the solution is to add constraints to all 3 views before readjusting the frame of any of them. But still, what could be causing this issue?

@LINK:/questions/26664204/calculating-crc8-in-vba
@TITLE:Calculating CRC8 in VBA
@CONTENT:So sadly I have to admit that I gave up on 8 hour search for the correct CRC8 code in VBA programming language. There are many examples, but yet I haven't find the one that works in my case. So here I am, asking you for help, if someone can write me this part of code, or if there's a misterious link, that I haven't clicked on. Explanation: AppID = "A00000039656434103F0154020D4000A" 
 In my project, it is required that char "A" is at the end of this AppID, since based on this the CRC8 should be calculated. If understand correct (cause I might have gone insane during entire day of trying to write this CRC8 function) I have 32-byte ID, on which I want to do the CRC8 check on the 16bits (does this make sense?) In the given example, I have only the result of what the CRC8 should return: CRC8 = 0x6D
 And I need to replace the lower nible with the char "A" in my main AppID: FinalAppID = "A00000039656434103F0154020D4000D"
 PROBLEM: But I simply don't know how to write nor to convert the codes from C++ / C#. And I was really strick with step by step conversion, yet it didn't work. This is the code I use: Public function calculateCRC8(ByVal AppID As String ) As String
    Dim CRC8 As Byte
    Dim i as Integer
    Dim j as Integer
    Dim AppIDarray()


    CRC8 = &HC7;?//Based on preset 0xE3?
????aidLenght = LEN(AppID)
    AppIDarray = StringToArray(AppID) ' I user a UDF that I wrote, this should work OK'
            For j = 0 To aidLenght
??????? ????????CRC8 = CRC8 Xor AppIDarray(j)?
??????? ??      For i = 1 To 8 
                    If CRC8 And &H80 Then
                     CRC8 = (CRC8 * 2) Xor &H1D
                    Else
                     CRC8 = CRC8 * 2
                    End If  
                next i
            Next j
    calculateCRC8 = CRC8
End Function
 I'm not in office now, so there might by typos in the above code, or some silly mistakes, I wrote it just now by my head, as I worked with it entire day. The problem that occurs with above code is: Error: Error: Overflow!
 This error occurs even if I pass the entire string, or just the 16bits. Same error. If anyone has anything to help me out here, I will be really grateful to him!

@TITLE:Hibernate and JSON - is there a definitive solution to circular dependencies?
@CONTENT:I'm struggling with Hibernate entities and JSON in these days and, although there is a lot of questions regarding the object, I'm yet not capable to serialize in presence of circular dependencies. I tried with both Gson and jackson but I didn't get a lot of progresses. Here is an excerpt from my objects. This is the "parent" class. @Entity
public class User extends RecognizedServerEntities implements java.io.Serializable
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "id", unique = true, nullable = false)
    private Integer id;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = "user", orphanRemoval = false)
    @Cascade({CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE})
    private Set<Thread> threads = new HashSet<Thread>(0);
    //...other attributes, getters and setters
}
 and this is the "children" class @Entity
@Table(name = "thread")
public class Thread extends RecognizedServerEntities implements java.io.Serializable
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "id", unique = true, nullable = false)
    private Integer id;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "author", nullable = true)
    private User user;
    //...other attributes, getters and setters
}
 I've written a simple class to test both gson and jackson features; as said, they both raise an exception. public class MyJsonsTest
{
    private static User u;
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        u = new User("mail", "password", "nickname", new Date());
        u.setId(1); // Added with EDIT 1
    //  testGson();
        testJackson();
    }

    private static void testJackson()
    {
        Thread t = new Thread("Test", u, new Date(), new Date());
        t.setId(1); // Added with EDIT 1
        u.getThreads().add(t);

        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        mapper.enable(SerializationFeature.INDENT_OUTPUT);
        try
        {
            mapper.writeValue(new File("result.json"), u);
        }
        catch {/[various exceptions catched, but a JsonMappingException was thrown]}
    }

    private static void testGson()
    {
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        System.out.println(u.toString());
        System.out.println(gson.toJson(u, User.class));

        Thread t = new Thread("Test", u, new Date(), new Date());
        u.getThreads().add(t);

        //This raise an exception overflow
        System.out.println(gson.toJson(u, User.class));
    }
}
 To solve the problem, on jackson side, I tried to use this annotation @JsonIdentityInfo(generator=ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class, property="id")
 on both User and Thread class. However, it doesn't solve the problem. On gson side, I read about the GraphAdapterBuilder class, but I wasn't able to properly use it. I don't find any jar, so I copy/pasted the source code from here. However, there is a compile time error at this line  private final ConstructorConstructor constructorConstructor = new ConstructorConstructor();
 because the ConstructorConstructor() is undefined; the right syntax should be ConstructorConstructor(Map<Type>, InstanceCreator<?> instanceCreators)
 So, is there a definitive solution to this problem? Obviously, I can't use transient variables. EDIT 1 I finally found the issue with jackson. In the test class, I forgot to initialize the id field (in real scenarios it is initialized by the database) and this is the reason of the exception. When I finally set the id, all works. This is the output {
  "id" : 1,
  "email" : "mail",
  "password" : "password",
  "nick" : "nickname",
  "registeredDate" : 1414703168409,

@CONTENT:I want to plot few graphs with matplotlib and I have a windows machine Firstly I need to install, so I download the file from http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html . Well, when I tried to run, it throws a pop up saying it failed to find the version 3.4 in registry. This is a bit strange because my python version is 3.4.1. Of course, I did search through the forum. I happened to look into numpy python 3.4.1 installation: Python 3.4 not found in registry which is same as my problem. but my first question: 1) The matplotlib official page gives me a direct link to install ".exe" for windows with python version 3.4. If this is true then why this problem should occur in the first place. 2) My second question, how one can actually find whether the downloading package version is the right match for the current python version installed on local PC.

@LINK:/questions/26630995/why-does-namespacemanager-not-use-defaultnamespace-when-using-no-prefix-in-xpath
@TITLE:Why does NamespaceManager not use DefaultNamespace when using no prefix in XPath
@CONTENT:When I want to traverse my XmlDocument using XPath, I came unto the problem that there were many ugly namespaces in the document, so I started using a NamespaceManager along with the XPath. The XML looks like this <Workbook xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"
 xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"
 xmlns:x="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel"
 xmlns:ss="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"
 xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40">
    <Worksheet ss:Name="KA0100401">
        <Table>
            <Row>
                <Cell>Data</Cell>
            </Row>
            <!-- more rows... -->
        </Table>
    </Worksheet>
    <Worksheet ss:Name="KA0100402">
        <!-- .... --->
    </Worksheet>
</Workbook>
 Now, from what I see from this document, "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet" is the default namespace, because it sits on the root element. So, naively, I configured my NamespaceManager like this: XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument();
document.Load(reader);
XmlNamespaceManager manager = new XmlNamespaceManager(document.NameTable);
manager.AddNamespace(String.Empty, "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet");
manager.AddNamespace("o", "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office");
manager.AddNamespace("x", "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel");
manager.AddNamespace("ss", "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet");
manager.AddNamespace("html", "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40");
 But, when I try to access a node foreach (XmlNode row in document.SelectNodes("/Workbook/Worksheet[1]/Table/Row", manager))
 I never get any results. I was under the impression that by setting the first namespace with an empty prefix, I wouldn't need to set that when searching for nodes in that workspace. But, as it is stated on the AddNamespace method: If an XPath expression does not include a prefix, it is assumed that the namespace Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is the empty namespace. Why is that? And, more important: How do I access nodes in the default namespace, if not using a prefix sets them into an empty namespace? What good is setting the default namespace on the manager if I can't even access it when searching for nodes?
@CODE:NamespaceManager <Workbook xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"

@TITLE:testing python multiprocessing: low speed because of overhead?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn about multiprocessing in python (2.7). My CPU has 4 cores. In the following code I test speed of parallel Vs serial execution of the same basic instruction. I find that the time taken using the 4 cores is only 0.67 the one taken by only one core, while naively I'd expect ~0.25. Is overhead the reason? where does it come from? Are not the 4 processes independent? I also tried pool.map and pool.map_async, with very similar results in terms of speed. from multiprocessing import Process

    for i in range(0,a[1]):
        j=0
        while j<10000:

 EDIT my PC has actually 2 physical cores (2 = 2 cores per socket * 1 sockets, from lscpu [thanks @goncalopp]). If I run the above script with only the first 2 processes I get a ratio of 0.62, not that different to the one obtained with 3 or 4 processes. I guess it won't be easy to go faster than that. I tested on another PC with lscpu: CPU(s):32, Thread(s) per core: 2, core(s) per socket: 8, Socket(s): 2, and I get a ratio of 0.34, similar to @dano. Thanks for your help

@CONTENT:R's output for a multivariable regression model including one or more factor variable does not automatically include a likelihood ratio test (LRT) of the significance of the entire factor variable in the model. For example: fake = data.frame( x1=rnorm(100), x2=sample(LETTERS[1:4], 
       size=100, replace=TRUE), y=rnorm(100) )

m = lm(fake$y ~ fake$x1 + fake$x2)

 If we want to test the significance of the entire variable x2 in the model, we can fit a reduced model m.red and use the LRT: m.red = lm(fake$y ~ fake$x1)
anova(m, m.red, test="LRT")
 But if you have many factor variables in a model, doing this over and over becomes ridiculous. I have to believe there is some built-in approach?

@TITLE:Spring Data JPA JpaRepository.save(entity) not returning database default values
@CONTENT:I have a fairly simple problem. In a single transaction, my code looks something like this: MyClass c = new MyClass();
c.setPropA("A");

c = myClassRepository.save(c);

c.setPropC("C");
 Where my entity looks like this: @Entity
@Table(name = "MY_CLASS")
public class MyClass {
  private String propA;
  private String propB;
  private String propC;

  @Id
  @Column(name = "PROP_A", unique = true, nullable = false, updatable = false)
  public String getPropA() { return propA; }
  public void   setPropA(String propA) { this.propA = propA; }

  @Column(name = "PROP_B", insertable = false)
  public String getPropB() { return propB; }
  public void   setPropB(String propB) { this.propB = propB; }

  @Column(name = "PROP_C")
  public String getPropC() { return propC; }
  public void   setPropC(String propC) { this.propC = propC; }
}
 And the database is set up like this (Dialect = Oracle 11G) CREATE TABLE MY_CLASS {
  PROP_A VARCHAR2 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  PROP_B VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'B' NOT NULL,
  PROP_C VARCHAR2
}
 So, based on the code to persist the entity, I would think I'd get queries that look something like this: MyClass c = new MyClass();
c.setPropA("A");

c = myClassRepository.saveAndFlush(c);
// INSERT INTO MY_CLASS (PROP_A, PROP_C) VALUES ("A", NULL)
// SELECT PROP_A, PROP_B, PROP_C FROM MY_CLASS -- to refresh `c`

c.setPropC("C");

// After transaction ends, flush change to `c.propC`
// UPDATE MY_CLASS SET PROP_B = "B", PROP_C = "C" WHERE PROP_A = "A"
 ... but the SELECT never happens. Why is the entity not refreshed? This breaks because of the UPDATE that (immediately) follows the INSERT and c.propB is still null. I get a ORA-01407: cannot update ("MY_SCHEMA"."MY_CLASS"."PROP_B") to NULL stack trace. I realize there are ways around this using @PrePersist or setting default values on columnDefinition in Java, but I shouldn't have to duplicate defaults. Note: This worked before when I was using org.hibernate.Session.saveOrUpdate() instead of Spring Data JPA for this action. Thanks in advance for any help!

@CONTENT:I am upgrading jpa, hibernate, spring, and jdk to enable the new features from JPA 2.1. But I am getting the following error: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.persistence.Table.indexes()[Ljavax/persistence/Index;  
 I have read other postings about this, but they do not resolve the error on my machine. For instance, SJuan76's answer to this posting suggests upgrading to jpa 2.1, but I have set the eclipse jpa project facet to version 2.1 and I have also included hibernate-jpa-2.1-api in my pom.xml. You can read all the versions of the various libraries in the complete pom.xml by clicking on this link. What do I need to change in the pom.xml or in the eclipse project to resolve this error? Note: I can get rid of the error by changing the hibernate version in the pom.xml back to <hibernate.version>4.2.1.Final</hibernate.version>, but this defeats the purpose of upgrading. Does the fact that changing the hibernate version turns the error on and off help us to diagnose the problem? If the problem is multiple jars conflicting with each other, I could use the eclipse type manager to disable one of the jars, but which jar would I look for?

@TITLE:Can't instantiate subclass of NSManagedObject
@CONTENT:Xcode 6 has had a ton of bugs. But I'm not quite sure if this is a bug or not. It might not be since this is something I'm just now learning. My issue is, any time I try to instantiate my subclass of NSManagedObject, I do not have the option to pass the entity: NSEntityDescription and NSManagedContext: insertIntoManagedContext argument to the constructor, Xcode says "Extra Argument 'entity' in call" I created a new Xcode project from scratch, just to see if I could re-create the problem in a smaller, minimal project. ToDoList.Item is set as the Item entity class in the Data Model Inspector. Here's the code: override func viewDidLoad() {

    super.viewDidLoad()

    let appDel: AppDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate
    let context: NSManagedObjectContext = appDel.managedObjectContext!

    let ent = NSEntityDescription.entityForName("Item", inManagedObjectContext: context)!

    //compiler complains here
    var item = Item(entity: ent, insertIntoManagedObjectContext: context)!

}
 Here's the subclass: import UIKit
import CoreData

class Item: NSManagedObject {

    @NSManaged var title: String
    @NSManaged var completed: Bool

}
 All help is appreciated.
@CODE:entity: NSEntityDescription NSManagedContext: insertIntoManagedContext Item override func viewDidLoad() {

@TITLE:How to use global namespace definitions in a fragment creation?
@CONTENT:The root element have namespace declarations like xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ... so, any node appended (ex. by appendChild) will accept the namespace. I can append <graphic xlink:href=".."/> because on the whole it is valid... But to append a fragment I need first to create the fragment with createDocumentFragment(). Example:     $tmp = $dom->createDocumentFragment();
    $ok = $tmp->appendXML('<graphic xlink:href="file123.ext"/>');
 when running, generates an error, DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML(): namespace error : Namespace prefix xlink for href on inline-graphic is not defined How to say "use the DomDocument namespaces" to the DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML() method? NOTES AND CONTEXTS (transfered as an answer, to not polute here)

@TITLE:ggplot2: Different legend symbols for points and lines
@CONTENT:already searched all related threads about this but could not find a solution. Here is my code and the attached plot result: g <-ggplot(NDVI2, aes(LAI2, NDVI, colour = Legend)) + 
    theme_bw (base_family = "Times") + 
    scale_colour_manual (values = c("purple", "green", "blue", "yellow",  "magenta","orange", "cyan", "red", "black")) + 
    geom_point (size = 3) +
    geom_smooth (aes(group = 1, colour = "Trendline"), method = "loess", size = 1, linetype = 5, se = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth (aes(group = 1, colour = "Regression (log)"),linetype = 1, size=1.2,method = "lm", formula = y~ log(x), se = FALSE) + 
    labs (title = "Correlation of LAI and NDVI")+ 
    theme (legend.title = element_text (size = 15)) 
 Which results in this plot: As you can see, all Legend Icons look the same. What I want is that the points are shown as points and the two lines ("Regression" and "Trendline") are shown as lines. I tried to use guides (colour = guide_legend (override.aes = list(size = 1.5)))
 but that gives me again all icons in the same way and I can not figure out how to distinguish between them I?m new to R and this is my first "complex" plot. Try to figure out most with online helps and google but can?t find a solution for this problem. Thank you all for your time and help! Here a dput of my data: dput(NDVI2)

@TITLE:Controller monkey patch in initializer gets lost when rails reloads classes
@CONTENT:I am trying to monkey patch controller classes in a third party gem. To be precise, I am trying to add parameter wrapping to devise controllers. In initializers/wrap_parameters.rb I added the following bit: Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  DeviseController.class_eval do
    wrap_parameters :user, format: [:json]
  end
end
 It works great when the application starts, but when I modify one of my controller classes, the parameter wrapping stops working immediately. As if the controller class was reloaded without the above patch. How to make my monkey patch persistent? Thanks

@TITLE:clicking on the android back button twice to exit the app
@CONTENT:i had previously asked this question but unfortunately i cant find a better solution regarding this issue.now my app contains first screen as a splash screen then next is a listview(main activity) then clicking on each row of listview opens each activity and my requirement is that if we press once the back button from any of my inner activities(activities that are openend when we click the listview rows)it must navigate to my main listview and then if we press once more from the listview the app must gets closed.so if i press the back button from my listview twice it will exit the app correctly .but my main problem is that if i press the back button twice from any of my inner activities my app is not getting closed i need to press thrice instead of closing the app from any of my inner activities.can anyone please help me ? my code for exiting the app is this i added this code in my main listview class.. private static final int TIME_INTERVAL = 3000; // # milliseconds, desired time passed between two back presses.
private long mBackPressed;

{

 In this example, I used a width of "50 000" for the canvas, but when I use the scrollbar the black box of the canvas ends before. The same issue also affects the horizontal line which is drawn on the canvas. Do I missed something ? Is there a known limit for the "width" attribute of the canvas ? Thanks for your help

@LINK:/questions/26577588/is-there-any-workaround-for-scala-bug-si-7914-returning-an-apply-method-from-a
@TITLE:Is there any workaround for Scala bug SI-7914 - returning an apply method from a Scala macro?
@CONTENT:In our library we have a macro defined like so: def extractNamed[A]: Any = macro NamedExtractSyntax.extractNamedImpl[A]
 This macro uses its type signature to return an apply method whose arguments match the apply method of the case class on which it is typed. The idea is that this allows the user of our library to make use of Scala's named parameters like so: lazy val fruitExtractor = extractNamed[Fruit](
  name = FruitTable.name,
  juiciness = FruitTable.juiciness
)
 However, this doesn't seem to work - it instead returns error: Any does not take parameters at compile-time. It seems like this is caused by SI-7914 because it does work if the user explicitly calls apply, i.e.: lazy val fruitExtractor = extractNamed[Fruit].apply(
  name = FruitTable.name,
  juiciness = FruitTable.juiciness
)
 We can work around this by simply renaming the returned method to something sensible, but is there any other way to work around this without requiring an explicit method call?
@CODE:def extractNamed[A]: Any = macro NamedExtractSyntax.extractNamedImpl[A] apply apply lazy val fruitExtractor = extractNamed[Fruit](
  name = FruitTable.name,
  juiciness = FruitTable.juiciness
) error: Any does not take parameters lazy val fruitExtractor = extractNamed[Fruit].apply(
  name = FruitTable.name,
  juiciness = FruitTable.juiciness

With jQuery you can just listen after a click event on a specific type of element like a <li> and add a class to its child element for a menu to open. I'm trying to do the same thing like the menu on this page http://geedmo.com/themeforest/wintermin/dashboard.html, with Angular. But can't find the correct way by using my own directive or existing ones like ng-hide and ng-show. If anyone have an example og guides on how to do this the best way, my day would be saved. :) I'm also new to angular so learning new thing every day.

@CONTENT:I have tried literally everything to try and rectify this error when trying to deploy an app to an actual android device for debugging but have been unable to solve the matter. Everytime I try to launch I get a failed [INSTALL_FAILED_DEXOPT] error and when checking the logcat it is always because there is no classes.dex in my debug apk. If I run gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug, there is no difference in the apk size so I'm assuming there is a build error in android studio. I am using android studio beta 0.86 and have tried it on 0.89 with the same result. I have tried build tools for 19.1 to 21 with no result. I have also tried different devices and created a new project (that has never been installed on my devices) and android studio seems to think it needs to be uninstalled first when attempting to deploy. I have tried switching my device to ART, uninstalling and reinstalling android studio, redownloading the sdk and restarting my computer. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING has worked. I think the problem started after I downloaded the lollipop apis but am not sure. I have tried uninstalling all apps with my package signature on my device but NOTHING works! Not even Project -> Clean Project -> Rebuild This is extremely frustrating as I cannot debug my apps anymore :/ has anyone had any experience with this error or ways to rectify it?

@LINK:/questions/26537300/deferred-loading-of-xaml
@TITLE:Deferred loading of XAML
@CONTENT:A project I'm working on has some rather complex XAML that is noticeably affecting visual performance. Quite a few controls are collapsed for the initial state; however, since their XAML is parsed and visual /logical trees built, it's very slow to show what amounts to an almost blank object. It looks like (and would like confirmation here) that using a ContentControl with an initial state of Collapsed and then embedding the desired control as a DataTemplate for that ContentControl, will defer loading of the desired control in the DataTemplate until the ContentControl is made visible. I've built a generic DeferredContentControl that listens for the LayoutUpdated event of the main UI control (in general whatever element it is that I want to appear quickly), and when the first LayoutUpdated event of that UIElement fires, I used the Dispatcher to flip the visibility of the DeferredContentControl to true, which causes the control in the DeferredContentControl's DataTemplate to instantiate. By the time the user has reacted to the initial view of the screen (which is now fast), the "slow to load" (but still collapsed) control in the data template is ready. Does this seem like a sound approach? any pitfalls? It seems to work well in testing both for Silverlight and WPF, and while it doesn't make things any faster it gives the perception of being as much as 50% snappier in my specific scenario.

@TITLE:Codility MissingInteger, Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to solve the codility MissingInteger problem link: Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer that does not occur in A.
For example, given:
  A[0] = 1    
  A[1] = 3    
  A[2] = 6
  A[3] = 4    
  A[4] = 1    
  A[5] = 2
the function should return 5.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
 My solution is:     class Solution {
    TreeMap<Integer,Object> all = new TreeMap<Integer,Object>();

    public int solution(int[] A) {

        for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++)
            all.put(i+1,new Object());

        for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++)
            if(all.containsKey(A[i]))
                all.remove(A[i]);

        Iterator notOccur = all.keySet().iterator();
        if(notOccur.hasNext())
            return (int)notOccur.next();

        return 1;

    }
}
 The test result is: Can anyone explain me why I got this two wrong answers? Especially the first one, if there is only one element in the array, shouldn't the only right answer be 1?

@TITLE:How to make the Toolbar title clickable exactly like on ActionBar, without setting it as ActionBar?
@CONTENT:Background I wish to show an ActionBar on PreferenceActivity, as it's not available for pre-Honeycomb devices (even in the support library). Because such a class isn't available on the support library, I can't just call "setSupportActionBar" . I also don't wish to use a library (like this one) since all of the libraries I've found still use Holo style, so they didn't get updated so far, with this in mind. To do this, I'm trying to mimic the look&feel of the title of the ActionBar into the new Toolbar class, that was presented on support library v7 . The problem I've succeeded putting a title and a an "up" button, but I can't find out how to make them clickable like a normal action bar, including the effect of touching. The code Here's the code: SettingsActivity.java public class SettingsActivity extends PreferenceActivity
  {
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_settings);
    addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.pref_general);
    final Toolbar toolbar=(Toolbar)findViewById(R.id.toolbar);
    toolbar.setBackgroundColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.windowBackgroundColor));
    toolbar.setTitle("Settings");
    toolbar.setClickable(true);
    toolbar.setLogo(getResIdFromAttribute(this,R.attr.homeAsUpIndicator));
    }

  public static int getResIdFromAttribute(final Activity activity,final int attr)
    {

 What I've tried I've tried all of the click listeners types of the Toolbar class, but none helped. The only thing that almost worked is to use "setNavigationIcon" instead of "setLogo", but that actually makes the title&icon being clicakable, yet only the icon shows its effect of being clicked (even if I click on the title). The question How can I add the look & feel of the Toolbar, to have the title & logo of it to look like the ActionBar?

  "version": 4
}
 Opening foo.json results in this buffer: lorem ipsum.

dolor sit amet.
 Changing the first line to "foo bar" and saving the file results in a foo.json with only the description field updated: {
  "creation_timestamp": "1411210038.000000",
  "description": "foo bar.\ndolor sit amet.",
  "version": 4
}
 What's the best strategy for this? My current attempt is so: open the JSON file with find-file create an invisible overlay from point-min to point-max parse json insert the value of the description property at point-min, creating a "view" add a local-write-file hook and an after-save hook The local-write-file hook kills the "view", updates the json in the overlay, and saves the file. The after-save hook recreates the "view" so the user can keep editing. This is long-winded and brittle. Is there a better way of working with data where the screen representation should be different than the disk representation?
@CODE:{
  "creation_timestamp": "1411210038.000000",
  "description": "lorem ipsum.\ndolor sit amet.",
  "version": 4
} lorem ipsum.

dolor sit amet. foo.json description {
  "creation_timestamp": "1411210038.000000",
  "description": "foo bar.\ndolor sit amet.",
  "version": 4
} description local-write-file after-save

@TITLE:Images losing quality for second when interacting with page
@CONTENT:When page gets any way of movement - window resizing, scrolling, hover, images used as icons does re-render and makes sides ruff, its very well seen on images with transparent background and circular border (like in example), is there any way to fix that? Example <body>
    <style>
        body{
            background: black;
        }
        img{
            max-width: 5vw;

        }
    </style>
    <img src="http://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/white/whatsapp-xxl.png">


</body>
 in this case when hovered, image will appear with sharp borders, some may say pixelated, and after some miliseconds it will go back to smooth borders, here is a fiddle for you - http://jsfiddle.net/o3qk5uaL/

@TITLE:How to test an Angular controller with a function that makes an AJAX call without mocking the AJAX call?
@CONTENT:I have a function in a controller that calls a service which in turn calls another service, which makes the AJAX call and returns the promise. To put it simply: MainController
    call = function(){
        //Handle the promise here, update some configs and stuff
        someService.call().then(success, failure);
    }

SomeService
    return {
        call: function(){
            return SomeOtherService.call();
        }
    }

SomeOtherService
    return {
        call: function(){
            return $http.get(someUrl);
        }          
    }
 How do I test the main controller's call function without actually making the AJAX call? I will obviously be testing the services separately. Update: So I made the changes as per the answer below, and this is what I get: angular.module('myApp')
.controller('LoginCtrl', ['$scope', '$location', 'AuthService', '$state', function ($scope, $location, AuthService, $state) {
    $scope.user     = {};
    $scope.login    = function(user) {
        $scope.user = user;

        //This login function in turn calls the 'authenticate' from another service 'Ajax' and the promise is handled here.
        AuthService.login($scope.user)
            .then(function() {
                $scope.loginStatus = {
                    message     : 'Login successful',
                    alertClass  : 'success'
                };
                $state.go('app.dashboard');
            }, function() {
                $scope.loginStatus = {
                    message     : 'Unauthorized access.',
                    alertClass  : 'danger'
                };
            });
        };

    $scope.closeAlert = function() {
        $scope.loginStatus = false;
    };
}]);

In particular, I cannot seem to find packages that I know I have installed on my computer to run using the system command in the R console. That is, running man pdflatex in a Terminal window yields the help manual for PDFLATEX. However running system('man pdflatex') from the R console yields the error message No manual entry for pdflatex. The issue persists even though I reinstalled R, RStudio and MacTex since I upgraded to Mac OSX 10.10. Any help would be appreciated!

@CONTENT:I'm using PhoneGap / Cordova to build an application for iOS and Android. With the standard behaviour, the webView is not shown until the JavaScript has been initialised and the Cordova API is ready. So until I call: document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);
 ... the screen is entirely blank. Only once the call to deviceready is initialised and the Cordova API has loaded is the webView made visible. I would like to show the webView as soon as possible, with no delay, so that the static HTML elements appear almost instantly, regardless of the Javascript state. I've got a very basic knowledge of Objective C and have had a look through the code but the Cordova library is big and I haven't yet found out how and when the webView is displayed. Does anyone know how I can show the webView as soon as the Objective C side has loaded, regardless of whether the Cordova API is ready yet or not? (And what downsides there might be to that if any?)

@LINK:/questions/26435282/issue-playing-audio-with-stackoverflows-javasound-tag-example
@TITLE:Issue playing audio with Stackoverflow's javasound tag example
@CONTENT:Reading about the javasound tag earlier today, I tried to implement the simple code that we can see there (with some minor modifications, such as using File instead of URL): File file = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/sound.wav");
Clip clip = AudioSystem.getClip();
AudioInputStream ais = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(file);
clip.open(ais); // exception
 But I'm getting a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format when I try to open the AudioInputStream that we see there. However, when I try it with the following code that I got from the internet File file = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/sound.wav");
AudioInputStream ais = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(file);
AudioFormat format = ais.getFormat();
DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(Clip.class, format);
Clip clip = (Clip)AudioSystem.getLine(info);
clip.open(ais);
clip.start();
 it does work: sound.wav is played correctly - however, I find this to be clunky for something that should be as simple as our first example, given on the javasound tag itself. By reading the documentation from clip, I acknowledged that IllegalArgumentException is thrown when [...] the stream's audio format is not fully specified or invalid. However, it does seem to be a valid format. What is wrong with our first example here? AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream() does accept a File as argument, and, as visible from the second example, it does appear to have valid audio file data, because it works. Am I missing something obvious? And, if so, shouldn't it be pointed out on javasound tag?
@CODE:File URL File file = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/sound.wav");
Clip clip = AudioSystem.getClip();
AudioInputStream ais = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(file);
clip.open(ais); // exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format AudioInputStream File file = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/sound.wav");
AudioInputStream ais = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(file);

@TITLE:How to solve ¡§The certificate is not valid and cannot be used to verify the identity of this website¡¨ error?
@CONTENT:The question is, How to solve "The certificate is not valid and cannot be used to verify the identity of this website" error?. Here are the details: I have a signed applet that has been working fine, until I updated Java to 8u25 (1.8.0_25-b18). Now, the application shows an alert message "Do you want to continue? The connection to this website is untrusted". There is a note in this message too, "The certificate is not valid and cannot be used to verify the identity of this website". The applet is loaded without problems. But when the user tries to use a specific function of that application, the warning message is displayed. I've checked the java console when this happens, and this warning message is displayed right after these lines: security: Obtain certificate collection in SSL Root CA certificate store
security: Invalid certificate from HTTPS server
network: Cache entry not found [url: https://sub.domain.net:9876, version: null]
 The application is downloaded from a different domain, say "https://app.domain.net/.....", so no jars are downloaded from "https://sub.domain.net:9876", but the applet connects to "https://sub.domain.net:9876" to send/receive data. The applet is signed correctly, and so far, it meets all the security requirements according to Java. This issue seems to happen when the application tries to connect internally with an HTTPS url like https://sub.domain.net:9876. That sites' SSL certificate is valid, issued by GoDaddy and has not expired. Again, this started to happen after updating my JRE to 8u25. I've tested adding the offending URL to Java security exception list, with no success. Here are a few screenshot of this problem: This is the warning message displayed: Edit 10/18/2014: Question posted in "Oracle Community" too, to increase answer options: Question in Oracle Community. Edit 10/21/2014: I noticed this: When I click the link "More Information" displayed in the "Security Warning" dialog, the reason displayed says: The application is being downloaded from a site other than the one specified by the security certificate. Downloading from "sub.domain.net" Expecting "*.DOMAIN.NET" This message says the application is BEING DOWNLOADED FROM "sub.domain.com", and that is false. The application (applet) is already downloaded, and it is only using that domain in an internal HTTPS request, to get/send business data, not to download additional Jars, JNLPs, etc.

@CONTENT:I've installed GitLab on Google Compute Engine using "Click to Deploy" from the project interface. The deployment is successful after a few minutes. I can SSH into the instance, and muck around with it as expected. I can also log in to GitLab using the web interface, and add SSH keys to my profile. So far, so good. However, when I attempt to push or pull to a new example repository, I receive this message: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

 I've removed my local SSH config so it doesn't interfere. Do I need to setup an SSH tunnel of some sort? What am I missing? UPDATE: Wiping out my local ~/.ssh folder, and regenerating an SSH key (which I've added to my profile in GitLab) produces the following error: Received disconnect from {GITLAB_IP_ADDRESS}: 2: Too many authentication failures for git

@CONTENT:I'm having issues debugging TypeScript in VS2013 Update 3. The breakpoints for the .ts files will not load. The associated .map files are generated and included in the project. I've tried the suggestion on Typescript 1.0 map files do not load and even specifying the location of the .map files explicitly in the TypeScript configuration for the project properties. None of it worked. This doesn't seem to be a browser issue either as none of various browsers when run load the breakpoints. That rules out this issue on GitHub as well: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/556 I have the most current version of Web Essentials, so all of the components are up to date. How do I get TypeScript debugging to work in VS2013? EDIT: Just to be clear I wish to debug via VSNET regardless of the browser. Meaning I would like to hit the VSNET breakpoints regardless of which ever browser I choose to start the app with (i.e. Chrome, FF, IE, etc.).

@TITLE:Custom Array Class: Constructor for Initialization of List
@CONTENT:I'm working on a custom array class in C++ (as a self-led exercise), and I'm not sure how to create a constructor that allows me to do something along the lines of: #include "array.h"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    array<int> test = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::cout << test(1) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
 The error that the compiler (VS Express 2013) gives me is "no instance of constructor array::array [with T = int]" matches the argument list. argument types are (int, int, int, int)." I'm not sure what the constructor that takes the enumeration of a set of elements is called. I know I've properly overloaded operator()(const int&). I also know that this (for a reason that's not clear to me) works: #include "array.h"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    array<char> test = "abcd";
    std::cout << test(1) << std:: endl; // prints 'a', as expected. 
    std::cout << test(4) << std::endl; // prints 'd', as expected.
    return 0;
}
 This is achieved with a array(const T[]) constructor: will the solution for the array<int> test = {1, 2, 3, ..., n} case be similar? Thanks in advance for any guidance. EDIT: Including the code below, in case it's helpful. template<typename T>

@LINK:/questions/26388632/polymorphic-functions-with-constant-return-type-in-shapeless
@TITLE:Polymorphic functions with constant return type in Shapeless
@CONTENT:Long story short, I'm trying to figure out how to define a function from a generic input to a single-typed output. The background: This is a continuation of Mapping over Shapeless record. After Travis's excellent answer, I now have the following: import shapeless._
import poly._
import syntax.singleton._
import record._

type QueryParams = Map[String, Seq[String]]

trait RequestParam[T] {
  def value: T

  /** Convert value back to a query parameter representation */
  def toQueryParams: Seq[(String, String)]

  /** Mark this parameter for auto-propagation in new URLs */
  def propagate: Boolean

  protected def queryStringPresent(qs: String, allParams: QueryParams): Boolean = allParams.get(qs).nonEmpty
}

type RequestParamBuilder[T] = QueryParams => RequestParam[T]

def booleanRequestParam(paramName: String, willPropagate: Boolean): RequestParamBuilder[Boolean] = { params =>
  new RequestParam[Boolean] {
    def propagate: Boolean = willPropagate
    def value: Boolean = queryStringPresent(paramName, params)
    def toQueryParams: Seq[(String, String)] = Seq(paramName -> "true").filter(_ => value)
  }
}

def stringRequestParam(paramName: String, willPropagate: Boolean): RequestParamBuilder[Option[String]] = { params =>
  new RequestParam[Option[String]] {
    def propagate: Boolean = willPropagate
    def value: Option[String] = params.get(paramName).flatMap(_.headOption)
    def toQueryParams: Seq[(String, String)] = value.map(paramName -> _).toSeq
  }
}
 In reality, the following would be a class constructor that takes this Map read from the query string as a parameter, but for simplicity's sake, I'm just defining a val: val requestParams = Map("no_ads" -> Seq("true"), "edition" -> Seq("us"))

// In reality, there are many more possible parameters, but this is simplified
val options = ('adsDebug ->> booleanRequestParam("ads_debug", true)) ::
  ('hideAds ->> booleanRequestParam("no_ads", true)) ::
  ('edition ->> stringRequestParam("edition", false)) ::
  HNil

object bind extends FieldPoly {
  implicit def rpb[T, K](implicit witness: Witness.Aux[K]): Case.Aux[
      FieldType[K, RequestParamBuilder[T]],
      FieldType[K, RequestParam[T]]
    ] = atField(witness)(_(requestParams))
}

// Create queryable option values record by binding the request parameters
val boundOptions = options.map(bind)
 This lets me do: boundOptions.get('hideAds).value // -> true
 The problem: Now I want to be able to reserialize options that have propagate = true. So basically, I need to filter my HList on the propagate field of every member, which should always return a Boolean, and then have each parameter reserialize itself to a Seq[(String, String)]. I've tried the following: object propagateFilter extends (RequestParam ~> Const[Boolean]) {
  override def apply[T](r: RequestParam[T]): Boolean = r.propagate
}   

object unbind extends (RequestParam ~> Const[Seq[(String, String)]]) {
  override def apply[T](r: RequestParam[T]): Seq[(String, String)] = r.toQueryParams
}

// Reserialize a query string for options that should be propagated
val propagatedParams = boundOptions.values.filter(propagateFilter).map(unbind).toList 
// (followed by conventional collections methods)
 , but it doesn't like my functions. I got the following error: <console>:31: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Boolean
 required: shapeless.Const[T]
    (which expands to)  AnyRef{type £f[T] = T}
             override def apply[T](r: RequestParam[T]) = r.propagate
 I believe I'm taking the wrong approach to a function that's supposed to have a polymorphic input but monomorphic output. Other failed attempts: object propagateFilter extends Poly1 {
  implicit def default[T](implicit st: Case.Aux[RequestParam[T], Boolean]) = at[RequestParam[T]](_.propagate)
}
 and def propagate[T](x: RequestParam[T]): Boolean = x.propagate
 and object propagateFilter extends Poly1 {
  implicit def default = at[RequestParam[_]](_.propagate)
}
 and object propagateFilter extends FieldPoly {
  implicit def rpb[T, K](implicit witness: Witness.Aux[K]): Case.Aux[
    FieldType[K, RequestParam[T]],
    Boolean
    ] = atField(witness)(_.propagate)
}
 None of which work, probably due to my own misunderstanding of what's going on.

@TITLE:How to query all tables that implement an interface
@CONTENT:I have implemented an interface for some of my entity classes: public partial class Order : IReportable
{
   public string TableName { get { return "Order"; } }
}

public partial class Client: IReportable
{
 public string TableName { get { return "Client"; } }
}


public interface IReportable
{
    string TableName { get; }
}
 Then I added this to the DbContext: public virtual DbSet<IReportable> IReportable { get; set; }
 When I try to query all the tables that implement this interface (as shown here): var result = from reportabletable in db.IReportable
             where reportabletable.TableName == table_name
            select reportabletable
 I get the following exception: The type 'Report.DataAccess.IReportable' was not mapped. Check that the type has not been explicitly excluded by using the Ignore method or NotMappedAttribute data annotation. Verify that the type was defined as a class, is not primitive or generic, and does not inherit from EntityObject.

@TITLE:How to do perform a dynamic_cast with a unique_ptr?
@CONTENT:I have a class hierarchy as follows: class BaseSession : public boost::enable_shared_from_this<BaseSession>
class DerivedSessionA : public BaseSession
class DerivedSessionB : public BaseSession
 Within the derived class functions, I regularly call functions like this: Func(boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<DerivedSessionA>(shared_from_this()));
 Since I was working with shared_ptr to manage the sessions, this was working fine. Recently, I discovered that my use of shared_ptr is not optimal for this case. That is because these sessions are singleton objects that maintain one socket per client. If socket is reconnected, the session copies used to become zombies. As workaround, I started passing shared_ptr by reference rather than copies. This solved the zombie problem. Ideally, I felt I should be using unique_ptr to store the session and then pass references to other functions. That opened a whole can of worms. How do I cast a base class unique_ptr object to derived class unique_ptr object? What is the unique_ptr version of the following line? Func(boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<DerivedSessionA>(shared_from_this()));
 I just want one copy of the session object, everything else should be reference.
@CODE:class BaseSession : public boost::enable_shared_from_this<BaseSession>
class DerivedSessionA : public BaseSession
class DerivedSessionB : public BaseSession Func(boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<DerivedSessionA>(shared_from_this())); shared_ptr shared_ptr shared_ptr unique_ptr unique_ptr unique_ptr unique_ptr Func(boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<DerivedSessionA>(shared_from_this())); unique_ptr shared_ptr std::dynamic_pointer_cast<> weak_ptr

@CONTENT:I got a problem with an IndexOutOfBoundsException while I want to update a ListView in JavaFX. What I need to do I have a ListView with elements that correspond to a small simulation. With a click on one list-element the graphical simulation updates based on the click a element of the ListView. Afterwards the ListView needs a update and other elements will be shown. That means all old elements will be removed and only the new ones will be shown. My code looks like that: public void init() {
    // simCont.initSimulation() returns ArrayList
    ObservableList<Default> obsDefaultList = FXCollections
            .observableArrayList(simCont.initSimulation());
    listTest.getItems().addAll(obsDefaultList);
    listTest.getSelectionModel().selectedItemProperty()
            .addListener(new ChangeListener<Default>() {

                @Override
                public void changed(
                        ObservableValue<? extends Default> observable,
                        Default oldValue, Default newValue) {
                    updateList(newValue);
                }
            });
}

private void updateList(Default chosen) {
    ObservableList<Default> list = FXCollections
            .observableArrayList(simCont.doSimulationStep(chosen.getId()));
    listTest.getItems().clear();
    listTest.getItems().addAll(list);

 Debugging was confusing because I found no reason for the exception. I searched the web but found nothing that worked for me. Hopefully somebody can help me with that issue.

@LINK:/questions/26341587/horizontalscrollview-customadapter-with-getview-doesnt-reuse-convertviews-li
@TITLE:HorizontalScrollView: CustomAdapter with getView() doesn't reuse convertViews like ListView
@CONTENT:In one of my past projects I implemented a "Time Picker Carousel". It is based on a HorizontalScrollView. The user can pick a time while scrolling this view. The time value is calculated from the X-Offset of the HorizontalScrollView. I wanted to share this project at github, but while cleaning up the code I realized some bad performance issue. The HorizontalScrollView is populated with a custom ArrayAdapter. The getView() uses a Holder for the convertView. I thought it might work as an adapter within a ListView, so only the visible items are rendered and reused if they will be destroyed. Instead, all items are rendered!!! (in my case 1008!) I add them myself (#1 in Code example), but even if I try to add less, the logic from remove (and recycle) old ones doesn't work, or did I miss something? So my basic question is: What do I have to change to make my adapter behave like ListView? I found this so link and tried overriding remove function, but this is never called (somehow logic, because i am only adding) There's a good PagerAdapter example at github, but somehow I cannot translate this to ArrayAdapter<String> Any thoughts, links are welcome! And please don't suggest using ListView instead. We decided to use HorizontalScrollView because of callbacks and the fact we already have a ListView in the layout.

@TITLE:How to pass protocol with associated type (generic protocol) as parameter in Swift?
@CONTENT:I have to pass an interface as a parameter to a function. Interface is generic a.k.a. has a associated type. I couldn't find a good way to do that. Here is my code: protocol IObserver : class {
    typealias DelegateT
    ...
}

class Observer: IObserver {
    typealias DelegateT = IGeneralEventsDelegate // IGeneralEventsDelegate is a protocol
    ...
}

func notify(observer: IObserver) { ... } // here I need a type for observer param
 I found that this will work: func notify<T: IObserver where T.DelegateT == IGeneralEventsDelegate>(observer: T) { ... }
 , but come on that is too complicated. What if I want to save this param in class variable, should I make the whole class generic, just because of this function. It is true that I'm C++ developer and I'm new to the Swift language, but the way the things are done are far too complicated and user unfriendly ... or I'm too stupid :)
@CODE:protocol IObserver : class {
    typealias DelegateT
    ...
}

class Observer: IObserver {
    typealias DelegateT = IGeneralEventsDelegate // IGeneralEventsDelegate is a protocol
    ...
}

func notify(observer: IObserver) { ... } // here I need a type for observer param func notify<T: IObserver where T.DelegateT == IGeneralEventsDelegate>(observer: T) { ... } protocol concept extension protocol concept_map pure virtual class multiple inheritance interface

@TITLE:Sending Email with Node Mailer and Sendgrid in Angular MEAN stack using angular-fullstack from Yeoman
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand where to locate the logic to send an email via a contact form in my Angular App (using angular-fullstack MEAN stack from Yeoman). I can add the logic to send an email in the app.js file on the server side using nodemailer and sendgrid and everything works and an email is sent every time I refresh the server, however I am a little fuzzy on where to place the logic so that it only gets sent once the form is submitted and it hits the server side. This is what the create action looks like on the Express JS side... exports.create = function(req, res) {
  Contact.create(req.body, function(err, contact) {
    if(err) { return handleError(res, err); }
    return res.json(201, contact);

  });
}; Here is the code in app.js that is working, but obviously not in the right place... var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
var sgTransport = require('nodemailer-sendgrid-transport');

var options = {
	auth: {
		api_user: 'username', // 'SENDGRID_USERNAME' - Recommended to store as evn variables
		api_key: 'password', // 'SENDGRID_PASSWORD'
	}
};

var mailer = nodemailer.createTransport(sgTransport(options));

var email = {
	to: 'sendto@email.com',
	from: 'sendfrom@email.com',
	subject: 'Test Email',
	text: 'Awesome Email',
	html: '<b>Bold and Awesome Email</b>'
};

mailer.sendMail(email, function(err, res) {
	if (err) {
		console.log(err)
	}
	console.log(res);
}); Coming from a rails background my initial thought is to stick the logic in the create action so that if the object is created successfully the email gets sent. Is this a correct way of thinking about it in this scenario...I am new to the MEAN stack. Thanks for any help...
@CODE:exports.create = function(req, res) {
  Contact.create(req.body, function(err, contact) {
    if(err) { return handleError(res, err); }
    return res.json(201, contact);

  });
}; var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
var sgTransport = require('nodemailer-sendgrid-transport');

var options = {
	auth: {
		api_user: 'username', // 'SENDGRID_USERNAME' - Recommended to store as evn variables
		api_key: 'password', // 'SENDGRID_PASSWORD'

@TITLE:How can I make a class field become a tag name using JAXB?
@CONTENT:I am using Java and JAXB for XML processing. I have the following class: public class Characteristic {

    private String characteristic;
    private String value;

    @XmlAttribute
    public String getCharacteristic() {
        return characteristic;
    }

    public void setCharacteristic(String characteristic) {
        this.characteristic = characteristic;
    }

    @XmlValue
    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Characteristic c = new Characteristic();
    c.setCharacteristic("store_capacity");
    c.setValue(40);
    Characteristic c2 = new Characteristic();
    c2.setCharacteristic("number_of_doors");
    c2.setValue(4);
}
 This is the result that I get: <characteristics characteristic="store_capacity">40</characteristics>
<characteristics characteristic="number_of_doors">4</characteristics>
 I want to get the following result: <store_capacity>40</store_capacity>
<number_of_doors>4</number_of_doors>
 How can I achieve this?

 I get this message quite less frequently with no logical reason. This never happened prior to PrimeFaces 5.1 final (community release). This should not happen as it is mentioned in the migration guide, There are no breaking changes and 5.1 should be a drop-in replacement from 5.0. Some of the deprecated features are removed. The migration guide mentions only two points that may cause backward compatibility issues. Support for literal texts in filterBy-sortBy expressions were deprecated in 5.0 and it is removed in 5.1. These attributes only work with value expression as in the past. Deprecated chart components are removed. To be a bit clearer. The application at present uses over 100 JSF managed beans. I still do not use CDI beans. Many of them are view scoped, a few of them are session scoped & application scoped and the rest of them (quite a few of them) are request scoped JSF managed beans. I remember precisely that I nowhere declared org.primefaces.component.datatable.DataTable as a class member in any of the JSF managed beans that I created. The application is currently running on JSF 2.2.8-02 using GlassFish Server 4.0.

@TITLE:Referencing a type parameter as a function parameter in Julia
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make an "integer mod p" type in Julia. (I'm sure there's already a package for this, it's just a personal exercise.) type Intp{p}
    v::Int8
end

function add(a::Intp{p},b::Intp{p})
    return Intp{p}((a.v + b.v) % p)
    end
 I'm getting an error when defining add that says p is not defined. How do I reference p from inside add? (Note: I could do something like type Intp
    v::Int8
    p
end

function add(a::Intp,b::Intp)
    return Intp((a.v + b.v) % a.p,p)
    end
 but this would require that p be stored with every single number. I feel like this would be inefficient, and I have my mind on generalizations where it would be really inefficient. I would rather p just be specified once, for the type, and referenced in functions that take things of that type as arguments.)
@CODE:type Intp{p}
    v::Int8
end

function add(a::Intp{p},b::Intp{p})
    return Intp{p}((a.v + b.v) % p)
    end type Intp
    v::Int8
    p
end

function add(a::Intp,b::Intp)

 I almost updated most of the plugins to the latest version, e.g. :spring-security-core:2.0-RC4 I also found an issue in grails's official jira, which describe the same problem as mine: https://jira.grails.org/browse/GPSPRINGSECURITYUI-62 I don't know if it's still a bug which is not solved yet?

 I get No such file or directory. Is there a way I can pass the & in? Eventually, I'd like to pass the & in to run this BackgroundProcessor in the background, and then run another app in the foreground. I saw this post for a different solution, http://blog.trifork.com/2014/03/11/using-supervisor-with-docker-to-manage-processes-supporting-image-inheritance/, but I thought I could run some stuff from the command line for proof of concept stuff for our app.

@TITLE:How to make these std::function parameters unambiguous?
@CONTENT:The following function overloads are ambiguous when passing a lambda. I found out that std::function can be constructed from most callable types, even if their signature does not match. So the compiler can't tell which function to use. template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T)> iterator);
template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T, id)> iterator);
template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T&)> iterator);
template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T&, id)> iterator);
 There are some similar questions out here, but none of them could solve my problem. How can I resolve the ambiguity without changing the usage? Morever, at the time I have to explicitly mention the template type. Is there a way around this?
@CODE:std::function template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T)> iterator);
template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T, id)> iterator);
template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T&)> iterator);
template <typename T> void each(std::function<void(T&, id)> iterator); T manager.entity.each<type::window>([=](type::window &window, id entity) { /* ... */ }); T std::function

@TITLE:MySql, loop (while foreach)
@CONTENT:I have a big problem. I get data from a database. I want to display them in tabs. My method is a loop in a loop. I show you the code. My problem is that the result (second loop) all data are output. The first loop displays each user name with the same id, in a own tab. that works. the second loop operates on the same principle. but the second loop does not filter. (!) The first loop show me correctly for every username with the same id the own Tab. but the sec on loop show me all event_names, not only the event names of the users. Resume: i got 3 user. every user. user 1 has his own tab. (2 events) user 2 has his own tab. (1 event) user 3 has his own tab. (1 event) in the second loop, i ask the events of every user. in the tab of user 1 must appear 2 events in the tab of user 2 must appear 1 event and in the tab of user 3 must appear 1 event too. BUT, in every tab (user 1,2 and 3) appear 4 events. the events of all users... is it a problem with the loop, isn't it? (!) Can someone help me?

@LINK:/questions/26293500/good-practice-to-protect-limit-functions-to-user-groups
@TITLE:Good practice to protect / limit functions to user groups
@CONTENT:I have a big project extending over multiple class files. This project was made in a hurry to make a deadline. This took its tall on the projects security. So to put it simple, anyone could in theory call an ajax script in my project and have it run since the functions in the scripts are not user privileges aware. Ofcourse I do a check in all my ajax php scripts to see wether a user is logged in or not. So here is an example: // Update user information. This script is called with jQuery AJAX:
 $iris = new IRIS();

if( !$iris->UUID() ){
    die( "Unauthorized access! ");
}

$result = array('success'=>true);

$users = new users();

try {
    $res = $users->createUser();
    $result = array( 'success' => true, 'result' => $_POST );
}
catch(Exception $e){
    $result = array( 'error' => true, 'errmsg' => $e->getMessage() );
}

echo json_encode( $result );
 I have 3 user classes: "Admin", "client", "employee". Now in theory, all of these could call this php script, and modify users, even if its just admins who should have access to do it. Users have specified privileges parameters in the database, which I define by a constant in my project: define('USER_AUTH_LEVEL', $_SESSION['auth_level']);
 I am aware that I could update every ajax php file and set: if( USER_AUTH_LEVEL !== 1 ) { die( 'You do not have access' ); }
 But what I want to do, is to protect all, or some of my classes' functions aswell. Lets say: class IRIS {
    public function doSomething(){
         // $function_access not defined, accessable by all
    }
    public function doSomethingAdmin(){
        $function_access = 1;
         // Should be limited to admins
    }
    public function doSomethingClient(){
         $function_access = 2;
         // Should be limited to clients
    }
}
 What I would like to achieve is a script that runs every time a function, no matter the class it is in is run. This script should check to see if the parameter $function_access is set. If it is, it should compare to the privileges level of the currently logged in user. If it does not match, the function should break. If it is not defined at all, anyone can run the function. Does anyone have an approach to this? Im totally blank here.
@CODE:// Update user information. This script is called with jQuery AJAX: $iris = new IRIS();

if( !$iris->UUID() ){
    die( "Unauthorized access! ");

$users = new users();

    $res = $users->createUser();
    $result = array( 'success' => true, 'result' => $_POST );
}
catch(Exception $e){
    $result = array( 'error' => true, 'errmsg' => $e->getMessage() );
}

echo json_encode( $result ); define('USER_AUTH_LEVEL', $_SESSION['auth_level']); if( USER_AUTH_LEVEL !== 1 ) { die( 'You do not have access' ); } class IRIS {
    public function doSomething(){
         // $function_access not defined, accessable by all
    }
    public function doSomethingAdmin(){
        $function_access = 1;
         // Should be limited to admins
    }
    public function doSomethingClient(){
         $function_access = 2;
         // Should be limited to clients
    }
}

@CONTENT:Is there a way to change the color of the violin plots in matplotlib? The default color is this "brownish" color, which is not too bad, but I'd like to color e.g., the first 3 violins differently to highlight them. I don't find any parameter in the documentation. Any ideas or hacks to color the violins differently?
