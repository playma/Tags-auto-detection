@TITLE:How to disable rubber band in iOS web apps?
@CONTENT:This: $('body').on('touchmove', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
 Works, but will disable scrolling throughout the whole page, which is far from ideal. This: $('*').on('touchstart', function(e){
    var element = $(this).get(0);

    if ( element.scrollTop <= 0 )                                           element.scrollTop = 1;
    if ( element.scrollTop + element.offsetHeight >= element.scrollHeight ) element.scrollTop = element.scrollHeight - element.offsetHeight - 1;
});
 Works on pages that have a scrolling area. However when there is nothing to scroll it will again show the rubber-band. So my question: How can you disable the rubber band effect and still keep the -webkit-overflow-scrolling areas scrollable? [Update] Best Solution Disable scrolling on all non-scrollable elements such as a tab bar or a navigation bar. anElement.addEventListener('touchmove', function( event ){ event.preventDefault() };
 Attach a scroll handler to the scrollable elements such as the main content. anElement.addEventListener('touchstart', function( event ){
        if( this.scrollTop === 0 ) {
            this.scrollTop += 1;
        } else if( this.scrollTop + this.offsetHeight >= this.scrollHeight ) {
            this.scrollTop -= 1;
        }
}
@CODE:$('body').on('touchmove', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); $('*').on('touchstart', function(e){
    var element = $(this).get(0);

    if ( element.scrollTop <= 0 )                                           element.scrollTop = 1;
    if ( element.scrollTop + element.offsetHeight >= element.scrollHeight ) element.scrollTop = element.scrollHeight - element.offsetHeight - 1;
}); -webkit-overflow-scrolling anElement.addEventListener('touchmove', function( event ){ event.preventDefault() }; anElement.addEventListener('touchstart', function( event ){
        if( this.scrollTop === 0 ) {
            this.scrollTop += 1;
        } else if( this.scrollTop + this.offsetHeight >= this.scrollHeight ) {
            this.scrollTop -= 1;
        }
} body {overflow:hidden; height: 100%;}

@TITLE:OAuth 2.0 with Google Analytics API v3
@CONTENT:I used to be able to query the Google Analytics API with my account's login & password. Google is now using OAuth for authentication which is great... The only issue is that I only need ONE access token. I don't wanna allow other users to fetch THEIR analytics data. I just wanna be able to fetch MY data. Is there a way I can generate an access token only for my app or my analytics account? I know such solutions exists... For instance, Twitter provides what they call a "single-user oauth" for apps that don't require a specific user to sign in. One again, all I'm trying to accomplish here is to fetch MY OWN analytics data via the API. Is there a way to properly do that?

@TITLE:Git Merge and Fixing Mixed Spaces and Tabs with two Branches
@CONTENT:I've gone through some similar SOQ's and have not seen an adequate solution for this case. I've noticed that in many files there is a dirty mix of tabs and spaces used for indenting. The coding standard we follow uses 4 spaces for a tab currently. Although this should have been addressed when it happened, I need to consider it now and would like to fix the files I come across. The issue is that there are two teams using different branches of code and we will eventually have to merge those branches. What will happen if we change all the files of our branch to be the correct formatting and try to merge it? Will it end up being difficult to do so? Will it show me a ton of conflicts? Ideally id like git merge to ignore whitespace but I dont know how it would know which version to choose. Are there better solutions from a reactive point of a view? This is primarily a tech leadership, code lint, code review issue, yet I am not in that position or case currently. Can I fix this easily? (Having the offenders handle the merge is out of the question unfortunately!)

@TITLE:Dealing with video (DVDs, .avi .mkv) in Java
@CONTENT:After looking around for a decent library for playing videos in Java, I've come unstuck. Everyone around is screaming not to use JMF because it's outdated, old and requires the user to install it, other alternatives such as VLCJ seem good if they work but are still relatively unstable and rely on hefty amounts of native code, and as for dealing with DVDs, that seems like gold dust to find in a free library! Current Options: Now JavaFX 2 is gaining momentum it's been something I've been seriously looking at (hence my question here) but I've no luck so far in trying to work out how to make it play anything more than bog standard FLV video. VLCJ is working well for what it does (see my current answer) and at the moment is what I'm going ahead with. It uses libvlc to do pretty much anything, as in it can play pretty much any file and plays DVDs out of the box too. Big problem is that you have to use multiple VMs for each player to get it to perform stably, and that means response is relatively slow. I also haven't got this approach to work on a Mac yet. JMF is ridiculously outdated, horrible and just not really an option as far as I'm concerned. I've played with it in the past, and the experience was not a good one! FMJ says it's a replacement drop in for JMF. I've yet to make it work, as have most other people I've spoken to, and that in itself makes me weary of its quality and comprehension even if I do manage to get it working! Xuggler is great for what it does, it's got brilliant tutorials and it's very well written. But while it's great for the low level transcoding work, playing a video and getting the frames in the right order and in sync and so on is just a nightmare to get working properly, and again adds more code which means more maintenance, potentially more bugs etc. etc... I haven't tried GStreamer-Java yet with any anger, though it doesn't seem to support DVD playback (it's an open source app I'm working on so commercial plugins aren't an option either) and it's codec support doesn't seem to be the widest. JCodec is an interesting effort, the only one I've seen to implement video support from a pure Java perspective - but support for formats is lacking at the moment and it's a relatively new project. Writing something myself in a different native library for each platform I want to support. This is the absolute last resort option due to the added maintenance and coding time it'd require. Based on the above (or anything else you can think of), what options would people recommend and are there any other sensible ones I've missed out? Or any others people think might be available in the near future?

@TITLE:Prevent iOS mobile safari from going idle / auto-locking / sleeping?
@CONTENT:In an iOS app you can set application.idleTimerDisabled = YES to prevent the phone from auto locking. I need to do this in mobile safari for a game like Doodle Jump where the user may not touch the screen for an extended period of time. Is there any documented method or hack to do this? (Update) They seem to be doing it somehow in this site http://www.uncoveryourworld.com. Visit from your iphone and when you get to the buildings/street scene with music playing in the background just leave your phone alone. It never goes to sleep. (Update 2) I've spent some time taking a closer look at how they might be keeping the phone from going to sleep. I've done a barebones test and it seems that the way they are looping the audio in the street scene is what keeps it from going to sleep. If you'd like to test this just put a simple audio player that loops on your page and click play: <audio src="loop.mp3" onended="this.play();" controls="controls" autobuffer></audio>
 Everywhere I searched it is being said that this isn't possible, so it is nice to see there is at least some way to do it even if a bit of a hack. Otherwise a browser based game with doodle-jump style play would not be possible. So you could have a loop in your game/app if appropriate or just play a silent loop.

@TITLE:Android find GPS location once, show loading dialog
@CONTENT:I am writing an app that requires the user's current location (lastknownlocation won't be very helpful) and displays a list of all the closest "items" to them taken from the database. I have got the finding of the closest items working well but only using a hardcoded latitude and longitude location for the time being but now it is time to implement finding the actual location. Can anyone provide an example of how to have the app find the current fine location in the background and have the app wait. I only need the location once not updates as the person moves. I have implemented a location listener however I understand getting a GPS fix can be slow. I have seen other examples using last known location or implementing the location listener which continues to run and update however as my Activity needs the location coordinates before it can display anything the app just crashes. I need to show a Progress Dialog while its searching. How can I have the locationlistener run once in the background and then remove location updates once it finds the location. I need the rest of the application to wait until it has a GPS location or timeout after say 20-30seconds. I would like a ProgressDialog up so the user knows that something is going on, but it just has to be the spinning loading animation not a percentage or anything. If possible I would like the user to be able to cancel the dialog if they are sick of waiting which then they can search by typing suburb etc instead. I have been trying to do it with threads but it is getting way more complicated than I feel it should be and still not working anyway. On iPhone this is much more simple? Can anyone provide a nice way of doing this, I have been ripping my hair out for a week on this and it is really putting me behind schedule for the rest of the app completion date. In summary I want to: * Find current coordinates * Show Progress Dialog while getting location * Have app be able to wait for successful location or give up after a certain time? * If Successful: Dismiss Progress Dialog and use coordinates to run my other methods for finding items closeby. * If Failed to get location: Dismiss Progress Dialog and show error message, and encourage user to use menu to go to Search Activity. * Use these coordinates if the user chooses map view from the menu, to show current location on the map and pins dropped at all the nearby items by using their coordinates from the database. Thanks guys, I hope I have explained myself well enough. Any questions just ask, I will be checking back regularly as I am keen to get this part completed.

 This really seems like a big effort just to get the current location once? I do not require updates or anything? Is there not a simpler way of having the application wait for a result? I have been stuck on this for so long.

@TITLE:How do I determine if Android can handle PDF
@CONTENT:I know Android cannot handle PDFs natively. However, the Nexus One (and possibly other phones) come pre-installed with QuickOffice Viewer. How would I determine whether the user has a PDF viewer installed? Currently, the code to start the PDF download looks pretty simple: Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setData(Uri.parse(url));
startActivity(intent);
 After the download, the user clicks on the downloaded file to invoke the viewer. However, if there is no PDF viewer, Android reports "Cannot download. The content is not supported on the phone." I want to determine if the user will get this message, and if so, direct them to PDF apps in the Android Market.

@LINK:/questions/14573654/spring-security-redirect-to-previous-page-after-succesful-login
@TITLE:Spring Security redirect to previous page after succesful login
@CONTENT:I know this question has been asked before, however I'm facing a particular issue here. I use spring security 3.1.3. I have 3 possible login cases in my web application : Login via the login page : OK. Login via a restricted page : OK too. Login via a non-restricted page : not OK... a "product" page can be accessed by everybody, and a user can post a comment if he's logged. So a login form is contained in the same page in order to allow users to connect. The problem with case 3) is that I can't manage to redirect users to the "product" page. They get redirected to the home page after a successful login, no matter what. Notice that with case 2) the redirection to the restricted page works out of the box after successful login. Here's the relevant part of my security.xml file : <!-- Authentication policy for the restricted page  -->
<http use-expressions="true" auto-config="true" pattern="/restrictedPage/**">
    <form-login login-page="/login/restrictedLogin" authentication-failure-handler-ref="authenticationFailureHandler" />
    <intercept-url pattern="/**" access="isAuthenticated()" />
</http>

<!-- Authentication policy for every page -->
<http use-expressions="true" auto-config="true">
    <form-login login-page="/login" authentication-failure-handler-ref="authenticationFailureHandler" />
    <logout logout-url="/logout" logout-success-url="/" />
</http>
 I suspect the "authentication policy for every page" to be responsible for the problem. However, if I remove it I can't login anymore... j_spring_security_check sends a 404 error. Any help on this ? EDIT : Thanks to Ralph, I was able to find a solution. So here's the thing : I used the property <property name="useReferer" value="true"/>
 that Ralph showed me. After that I had a problem with my case 1) : when logging via the login page, the user stayed in the same page (and not redirected to the home page, like it used to be). The code until this stage was the following : <!-- Authentication policy for login page -->
<http use-expressions="true" auto-config="true" pattern="/login/**">
    <form-login login-page="/login" authentication-success-handler-ref="authenticationSuccessHandlerWithoutReferer" />
</http>

<!-- Authentication policy for every page -->
<http use-expressions="true" auto-config="true">
    <form-login login-page="/login" authentication-failure-handler-ref="authenticationFailureHandler" />
    <logout logout-url="/logout" logout-success-url="/" authentication-success-handler-ref="authenticationSuccessHandler"/>
</http>

<beans:bean id="authenticationSuccessHandler" class="org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler">
    <!-- After login, return to the last visited page -->
    <beans:property name="useReferer" value="true" />
</beans:bean>

<beans:bean id="authenticationSuccessHandlerWithoutReferer" class="org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler">
    <!-- After login, stay to the same page -->
    <beans:property name="useReferer" value="false" />
</beans:bean>
 This should work, in theory at least, but it wasn't. I still dont know why, so if someone has an answer on this, I will gladly create a new topic to allo him to share his solution. In the meantime, I came to a workaround. Not the best solution, but like I said, if someone has something better to show, I'm all ears. So this is the new authentication policy for the login page : <http use-expressions="true" auto-config="true" pattern="/login/**" >
    <intercept-url pattern="/**" access="isAnonymous()" />
    <access-denied-handler error-page="/"/>
</http>
 The solution here is pretty obvious : the login page is allowed only for anonymous users. Once a user is connected, the error handler redirects him to the home page. I did some tests, and everything seems to be working nicely. That's all for now, if you have any questions, please let me know.

@LINK:/questions/14523468/redirecting-to-previous-page-after-login-php
@TITLE:Redirecting to previous page after login? PHP
@CONTENT:I've been searching for a solution but it's seem I can't get it right, no matter what I try. After successful login, the user should be redirected to the page he came from, let's say he's been browsing a post and wants to log in so he can leave a comment, so he should be redirected to the post he was browsing. So here is what I have: login.php shows the login form: <form method="post" action="login-check.php">
... //input for username and password
</form>
 The login-check.php checks if the username and pass are entered, does the user exist, or if he's already logged in, and a p parameter is sent to login.php: <?php
session_start();
if((empty($username) OR empty($password) AND !isset($_SESSION['id_login']))) {
   header("Location:login.php?p=1");
   exit();
}
elseif (!user_exists($username,$password) AND !isset($_SESSION['id_login'])) {
   header("Location:login.php?p=2");
   exit();
}
elseif(isset($_SESSION['id_login'])) {
   header("Location:login.php?p=3");
   exit();
}
?>
 p is sent back to login.php and displays the according message: <?php
if(isset($_GET['p'])) {
  $p = $_GET["p"];

  if($p=="1")
    echo "<p class=\"red\">You didn't fill the form.</p><br></br>";
  if($p=="2")
    echo "<p class=\"red\">User exists.</p><br></br>";
  if($p=="3")
    header("Location: index.php");
}
?>
 BUT, instead of going to index.php after successful login, it should go to the page the user has previously been. I've tried in different ways but ether it doesn't work at all or it returns to login.php. It doesn't need to be super safe, because I'm doing this for a school project. ALSO, I consider myself pretty novice, so please have patience :D
@CODE:<form method="post" action="login-check.php">
... //input for username and password
</form> <?php
session_start();
if((empty($username) OR empty($password) AND !isset($_SESSION['id_login']))) {
   header("Location:login.php?p=1");
   exit();
}
elseif (!user_exists($username,$password) AND !isset($_SESSION['id_login'])) {
   header("Location:login.php?p=2");
   exit();
}
elseif(isset($_SESSION['id_login'])) {
   header("Location:login.php?p=3");
   exit();
}
?> <?php
if(isset($_GET['p'])) {
  $p = $_GET["p"];

  if($p=="1")
    echo "<p class=\"red\">You didn't fill the form.</p><br></br>";
  if($p=="2")
    echo "<p class=\"red\">User exists.</p><br></br>";

@TITLE:android maps: How to Long Click a Map?
@CONTENT:How do I long click on a mapview so that a place marker appears at that point on the map? I tried a couple ways without success: 1) Using setOnLongClickListener on the MapvView which never detected the longclicks. 2) My other idea was to extend MapView to override dispatchTouchEvent .. Create a GestureDetector to respond to longpress callback. But I was stuck midway here as I could not get a handle to my subclassed Mapview. i.e. MyMapview mymapview; //MyMapView extends MapView

//results in a classcast exception
mymapView = (MyMapView) findViewById(R.id.map);
 3) The only other way I know how to try this is: Detect a MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN and post a delayed runnable to a handler and detect longpress if the two other events: acton_move or an action_up, have not happened. Can someone provide thoughts on any of these methods to detect long presses?
@CODE:setOnLongClickListener MapvView MapView dispatchTouchEvent MyMapview mymapview; //MyMapView extends MapView

@CONTENT:I updated my question "Sizing a UILabel (in the iPhone SDK) to fit?" with a description of my problem with a suggested solution, but didn't get an answer. Perhaps I'll have better results by asking a new question... I set a breakpoint after the following code: NSString *theText = @"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.";

@TITLE:What is a catamorphism and can it be implemented in C# 3.0?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn about catamorphisms and I've read the Wikipedia article and the first couple posts in the series of the topic for F# on the Inside F# blog. I understand that it's a generalization of folds (i.e., mapping a structure of many values to one value, including a list of values to another list). And I gather that the fold-list and fold-tree is a canonical example. Can this be shown to be done in C#, using LINQ's Aggregate operator or some other higher-order method?

@TITLE:Optimizing Conway's 'Game of Life'
@CONTENT:To experiment, I've (long ago) implemented Conway's Game of Life (and I'm aware of this related question!). My implementation worked by keeping 2 arrays of booleans, representing the 'last state', and the 'state being updated' (the 2 arrays being swapped at each iteration). While this is reasonably fast, I've often wondered about how to optimize this. One idea, for example, would be to precompute at iteration N the zones that could be modified at iteration (N+1) (so that if a cell does not belong to such a zone, it won't even be considered for modification at iteration (N+1)). I'm aware that this is very vague, and I never took time to go into the details... Do you have any ideas (or experience!) of how to go about optimizing (for speed) Game of Life iterations?

@TITLE:Writing a privileged helper tool with SMJobBless()
@CONTENT:Even though the API has been open since Mac OS X Leopard, there's surprisingly, and unfortunately, very little documentation on how to correctly use SMJobBless() for creating privileged helper tools. There are a lot of gotchas, even when copying code directly from Apple's sample project. Luckily, I've found my way around this, and have gotten the basis for my helper tool working. However, it would seem that SMJobBless() only blesses the tool and copies it over, but doesn't run it. I've included code in my helper tool's main() function that should run, but doesn't (since NSLog() inexplicably doesn't workVaccording to the tiny bit of information I have foundVI've tried syslog()ing some "Hello world" type strings, but nothing appears on the system console). There's no indication that the helper tool is launched at all. The documentation is mostly useless. It simply says that after SMJobBless() is called, the helper tool is 'ready', with no indication of what 'ready' even means. Furthermore, Apple's sample doesn't include any interprocess communication code, and doesn't explain how one is supposed to interact with the helper tool. Do you use Distributed Objects? Mach ports? Who knows? There's no official word on how to do it. So, does anyone have any information on how to get this done? I've confirmed that the helper tool is installed, and authentication works, but I simply can't figure out how to launch the helper tool and communicate with it - there's simply such a gap in the documentation that this is a mystery for now. It's very frustrating; I can't be the only one with this problem (but there's little mention of it anywhere), and SMJobBless() obviously works somehow, since it's what Apple uses. (Please don't mention AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges(). I'm not using it: it's deprecated, sure to go away, and is a major security hole. No thanks.)

@TITLE:Binding Button click to a method
@CONTENT:I have a datagrid bound to an observable collection of objects. What I want to do is have a button that will execute a method of the object representing the row of the button that was clicked. So what I have now is something like this:             <DataGridTemplateColumn Header="Command">
                <DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>
                    <DataTemplate>
                        <Button Name="cmdCommand" Click="{Binding Command}" 
                                Content="Command"/>
                    </DataTemplate>
                </DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>
            </DataGridTemplateColumn>
 Which doesn't work and reports the following error: Click="{Binding Command}" is not valid. '{Binding Command}' is not a valid event handler method name. Only instance methods on the generated or code-behind class are valid. I've looked at command binding but that looks like it would just end up going to a single external command instead of to the object bound to the row. I have it working using an event handler on the code behind and then routing it to the item bound to the selected row (since the row gets selected when the button is clicked) but that seems like poor way of handing this and I assume I'm just missing something here.
@CODE:<DataGridTemplateColumn Header="Command">
                <DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>
                    <DataTemplate>

@TITLE:Getting setting cookies on different domains, with javascript or other
@CONTENT:Haven't been able to find anything particular to this situation online so here i go... I need to set/get the cookies stored at "first.com" while browsing "second.com", I have full access of "first.com" but i only have javascript access (can manipulate the DOM as i want) on "second.com". My first approach was to create an iframe on second.com (with js) that loaded a page like "first.com/doAjax?setCookie=xxx" and that did an ajax call to say "first.com/setCookie?cookieData=xxx" which would set the cookie on "first.com" with the data we passed around. That pretty much worked fine for setting the cookie on first.com from second.com - for getting a cookie I basically followed the same procedure, created the iframe that loaded "first.com/doAjax?getCookie" and that would do an ajax call to say "first.com/getCookie" which would read the cookie info on first.com and return it as a JSON object. The problem is that I'm unable to bring that JSON cookie object back to "second.com" so I can read it, well maybe i could just bring it when the Ajax call is complete using "window.top" but there's timing issues because its not relative to when the iframe has been loaded. I hope i am clear and was wondering if there's an easier solution rather than this crazy iframe->ajax crap, also seems like this wont even work for getting cookies in SAFARI.

@TITLE:Rotating image. Animation list or animated rotate? (Android)
@CONTENT:I want to create a rotating progress image, and wonder what's the best way to proceed. I can make it work with an animation list with for example 12 images changing every 100ms. This works fine, but it's quite tedious to create 12 images or for every size and resolution: <animation-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:oneshot="false">
<item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_loading_grey_on_black_01" android:duration="100" />
<item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_loading_grey_on_black_02" android:duration="100" />

<item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_loading_grey_on_black_10" android:duration="100" />
<item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_loading_grey_on_black_11" android:duration="100" />
<item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_loading_grey_on_black_12" android:duration="100" />
 I suppose that an easier solution is to use one image per resolution, but rather rotate it for each frame. In the platform resources (android-sdk-windows/platforms...) I found something called animated-rotate in the file drawable/search_spinner.xml, but if I copy the code get a compiler error complaining about android:framesCount and android:frameDuration (Google APIs 2.2 in Eclipse): <animated-rotate xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
android:drawable="@drawable/spinner_black_20"
android:pivotX="50%"
android:pivotY="50%"
android:framesCount="12"
android:frameDuration="100" />
 I have also tried using a repeating rotate animation (using in the anim resource folder), but I actually prefer the look of the animation list version. What is the recommended way of solving this problem?
@CODE:<animation-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:oneshot="false">

@TITLE:Can js/jQuery determine the orientation of the iPhone?
@CONTENT:Out of curiosity I've been playing with jQuery to determine the browser's screen size, and it occurred to me that screen size could be used to determine whether or not a visitor was using an iPhone/iTouch to view the site. So I used the following to test this: $(document).ready(

    function() {

        var screenX = screen.width,
            screenY = screen.height;

        alert("X: " + screenX + " Y: " + screenY);

        if (screenX == 320 && screenY == 396) {
            $('div#wrap').css('background-color','#f00');
        }

        else if (screenY == 320 && screenX == 396) {
            $('div#wrap').css('background-color','#0f0');
        }
    }
);
 On viewing the page via iPhone, I notice that the dimensions are consistently (regardless of orientation): x: 320, y: 396 This is regardless of orientation. I haven't, as yet, attempted to use an onChange event to detect changes (mainly because I'm still so new at jQuery), but I wondered if there was a way to determine, via jQuery or plain javascript, the iPhone/iTouch's orientation?
@CODE:$(document).ready(

    function() {

        var screenX = screen.width,
            screenY = screen.height;

@LINK:/questions/6301676/mathematica-rasters-in-3d-graphics
@TITLE:Mathematica: Rasters in 3D graphics
@CONTENT:There are times when exporting to a pdf image is simply troublesome. If the data you are plotting contains many points then your figure will be big in size and the pdf viewer of your choice will spend most of its time rendering this high quality image. We can thus export this image as a jpeg, png or tiff. The picture will be fine from a certain view but when you zoom in it will look all distorted. This is fine to some extent for the figure we are plotting but if your image contains text then this text will look pixelated. In order to try to get the best of both worlds we can separate this figure into two parts: Axes with labels and the 3D picture. The axes can thus be exported as pdf or eps and the 3D figure as a raster. I wish I knew how later combine the two in Mathematica, so for the moment we can use a vector graphics editor such as Inkscape or Illustrator to combine the two. I managed to achieve this for a plot I made in a publication but this prompt me to create routines in Mathematica in order to automatize this process. Here is what I have so far: SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];
SetOptions[$FrontEnd, PrintingStyleEnvironment -> "Working"];
 I like to start my notebook by setting the working directory to the notebook directory. Since I want my images to be of the size I specify I set the printing style environment to working, check this for more info. in = 72;
G3D = Graphics3D[
  AlignmentPoint -> Center,
  AspectRatio -> 0.925,
  Axes -> {True, True, True},
  AxesEdge -> {{-1, -1}, {1, -1}, {-1, -1}},
  AxesStyle -> Directive[10, Black],
  BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", FontSize -> 12},
  Boxed -> False,
  BoxRatios -> {3, 3, 1},
  LabelStyle -> Directive[Black],
  ImagePadding -> All,
  ImageSize -> 5 in,
  PlotRange -> All,
  PlotRangePadding -> None,
  TicksStyle -> Directive[10],
  ViewPoint -> {2, -2, 2},
  ViewVertical -> {0, 0, 1}
 ]
 Here we set the view of the plot we want to make. Now lets create our plot. g = Show[
  Plot3D[Sin[x y], {x, 0, Pi}, {y, 0, Pi}, 
   Mesh -> None,
   AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}
   ], 
  Options[G3D]
 ]
 Now we need to find a way of separating. Lets start by drawing the axes. axes = Graphics3D[{}, AbsoluteOptions[g]]
 fig = Show[g, 
  AxesStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0]],
  FaceGrids -> {{-1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}}
 ]
 I included the facegrids so that we can match the figure with the axis in the post editing process. Now we export both images. Export["Axes.pdf", axes];
Export["Fig.pdf", Rasterize[fig, ImageResolution -> 300]];
 You will obtain two pdf files which you can edit in and put together into a pdf or eps. I wish it was that simple but it isn't. If you actually did this you will obtain this: The two figures are different sizes. I know axes.pdf is correct because when I open it in Inkspace the figure size is 5 inches as I had previously specified. I mentioned before that I managed to get this with one of my plots. I will clean the file and change the plots to make it more accessible for anyone who wants to see that this is in fact true. In any case, does anyone know why I can't get the two pdf files to be the same size? Also, keep in mind that we want to obtain a pretty plot for the Rasterized figure. Thank you for your time. PS. As a bonus, can we avoid the post editing and simply combine the two figures in mathematica? The rasterized version and the vector graphics version that is. EDIT: Thanks to rcollyer for his comment. I'm posting the results of his comment. One thing to mention is that when we export the axes we need to set Background to None so that we can have a transparent picture. Export["Axes.pdf", axes, Background -> None];
Export["Fig.pdf", Rasterize[fig, ImageResolution -> 300]];
a = Import["Axes.pdf"];
b = Import["Fig.pdf"];
Show[b, a]
 And then, exporting the figure gives the desired effect Export["FinalFig.pdf", Show[b, a]]
 The axes preserve the nice components of vector graphics while the figure is now a Rasterized version of the what we plotted. But the main question still remains. How do you make the two figures match? UPDATE: My question has been answered by Alexey Popkov. I would like to thank him for taking the time to look into my problem. The following code is an example for those of you want to use the technique I previously mentioned. Please see Alexey Popkov's answer for useful comments in his code.

 The only difference I found between M7 and M8 using the above code is that M7 does not export the eps file correctly. Other than that everything is working fine now. :) The first column shows the output obtained from M7.

@TITLE:User Interface design books/resources for programmers [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm going to make my monthly trip to the bookstore soon and I'm kind of interested in learning some user interface and/or design stuff - mostly web related, what are some good books I should look at? One that I've seen come up frequently in the past is Don't Make Me Think, which looks promising. I'm aware of the fact that programmers often don't make great designers, and as such this is more of a potential hobby thing than a move to be a professional designer. I'm also looking for any good web resources on this topic. I subscribed to Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox newsletter, for instance, although it seems to come only once a month or so. Thanks!

@TITLE:Combined plot of ggplot2 (Not in a single Plot), using par() or layout() function? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Creating arbitrary panes in ggplot2 4 answers I've been thinking of using par() or layout() functions for combining ggplots. Will it be possible to use those functions? Say I want to plot ggplot for scatterplot and ggplot for histogram. And I want to combine the two plots (NOT IN A SINGLE PLOT). Is it applicable? I tried it with simple plotting in R, without using the ggplot functions. And it works actually. Here's a sample from Quick-R, Link: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/layout.html # 4 figures arranged in 2 rows and 2 columns
attach(mtcars)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(wt,mpg, main="Scatterplot of wt vs. mpg")
plot(wt,disp, main="Scatterplot of wt vs disp")
hist(wt, main="Histogram of wt")
boxplot(wt, main="Boxplot of wt")

# One figure in row 1 and two figures in row 2
attach(mtcars)
layout(matrix(c(1,1,2,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
hist(wt)
hist(mpg)
hist(disp)
 But when I try to use ggplot, and combine the plot, I don't get an output.

@LINK:/questions/6301676/mathematica-rasters-in-3d-graphics
@TITLE:Mathematica: Rasters in 3D graphics
@CONTENT:There are times when exporting to a pdf image is simply troublesome. If the data you are plotting contains many points then your figure will be big in size and the pdf viewer of your choice will spend most of its time rendering this high quality image. We can thus export this image as a jpeg, png or tiff. The picture will be fine from a certain view but when you zoom in it will look all distorted. This is fine to some extent for the figure we are plotting but if your image contains text then this text will look pixelated. In order to try to get the best of both worlds we can separate this figure into two parts: Axes with labels and the 3D picture. The axes can thus be exported as pdf or eps and the 3D figure as a raster. I wish I knew how later combine the two in Mathematica, so for the moment we can use a vector graphics editor such as Inkscape or Illustrator to combine the two. I managed to achieve this for a plot I made in a publication but this prompt me to create routines in Mathematica in order to automatize this process. Here is what I have so far: SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];
SetOptions[$FrontEnd, PrintingStyleEnvironment -> "Working"];
 I like to start my notebook by setting the working directory to the notebook directory. Since I want my images to be of the size I specify I set the printing style environment to working, check this for more info. in = 72;
G3D = Graphics3D[
  AlignmentPoint -> Center,
  AspectRatio -> 0.925,
  Axes -> {True, True, True},
  AxesEdge -> {{-1, -1}, {1, -1}, {-1, -1}},
  AxesStyle -> Directive[10, Black],
  BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", FontSize -> 12},
  Boxed -> False,
  BoxRatios -> {3, 3, 1},
  LabelStyle -> Directive[Black],

  PlotRange -> All,
  PlotRangePadding -> None,
  TicksStyle -> Directive[10],
  ViewPoint -> {2, -2, 2},
  ViewVertical -> {0, 0, 1}
 ]
 Here we set the view of the plot we want to make. Now lets create our plot. g = Show[
  Plot3D[Sin[x y], {x, 0, Pi}, {y, 0, Pi}, 
   Mesh -> None,
   AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}
   ], 
  Options[G3D]
 ]
 Now we need to find a way of separating. Lets start by drawing the axes. axes = Graphics3D[{}, AbsoluteOptions[g]]
 fig = Show[g, 
  AxesStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0]],
  FaceGrids -> {{-1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}}
 ]
 I included the facegrids so that we can match the figure with the axis in the post editing process. Now we export both images. Export["Axes.pdf", axes];

@TITLE:MJPEG streaming and decoding
@CONTENT:I want to receive JPEG images from an IP camera (over RTSP). For this, I tried cvCreateFileCapture_FFMPEG in OpenCV. But ffmpeg seems to have some problem with the MJPEG format of the streaming (since it automatically tries to detect the streaming info) and I end up with the following error mjpeg: unsupported coding type
 I, then, decided to use live555 for streaming. Till now, I can successfully establish streaming and capture (non-decoded) images through openRTSP. The question is how can I do this in my application, e.g., in OpenCV. How can I use openRTSP in OpenCV to get images and save them in JPEG format? I have heard that the data from openRTSP can be sent to a buffer (or a named pipe) and then read in OpenCV's IplImage. But I don't know how to do this. I will really appreciate any help/suggestion in about this problem. I need answers of either of the following questions: How can I disable ffmpeg's automatic stream information detection and specify my own format (mjpeg), or How can I use openRTSP in OpenCV? Regards,

@TITLE:PCM -> AAC (Encoder) -> PCM(Decoder) in real-time with correct optimization
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement AudioRecord (MIC) ->

PCM -> AAC Encoder
AAC -> PCM Decode

-> AudioTrack??  (SPEAKER)
 with MediaCodec on Android 4.1+ (API16). Firstly, I successfully (but not sure correctly optimized) implemented PCM -> AAC Encoder by MediaCodec as intended as below private boolean setEncoder(int rate)
{
    encoder = MediaCodec.createEncoderByType("audio/mp4a-latm");
    MediaFormat format = new MediaFormat();
    format.setString(MediaFormat.KEY_MIME, "audio/mp4a-latm");
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_CHANNEL_COUNT, 1);
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_SAMPLE_RATE, 44100);
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_BIT_RATE, 64 * 1024);//AAC-HE 64kbps
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_AAC_PROFILE, MediaCodecInfo.CodecProfileLevel.AACObjectHE);
    encoder.configure(format, null, null, MediaCodec.CONFIGURE_FLAG_ENCODE);
    return true;
}
 INPUT: PCM Bitrate = 44100(Hz) x 16(bit) x 1(Monoral) = 705600 bit/s OUTPUT: AAC-HE Bitrate = 64 x 1024(bit) = 65536 bit/s So, the data size is approximately compressed x11 ,and I confirmed this working by observing a log AudioRecoderR 4096 bytes read AudioEncoderR 369 bytes encoded the data size is approximately compressed x11, so far so good. Now, I have a UDP server to receive the encoded data, then decode it. The decoder profile is set as follows: private boolean setDecoder(int rate)
{
    decoder = MediaCodec.createDecoderByType("audio/mp4a-latm");
    MediaFormat format = new MediaFormat();
    format.setString(MediaFormat.KEY_MIME, "audio/mp4a-latm");
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_CHANNEL_COUNT, 1);
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_SAMPLE_RATE, 44100);
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_BIT_RATE, 64 * 1024);//AAC-HE 64kbps
    format.setInteger(MediaFormat.KEY_AAC_PROFILE, MediaCodecInfo.CodecProfileLevel.AACObjectHE);
    decoder.configure(format, null, null, 0);

    return true;
}
 Since UDPserver packet buffer size is 1024 UDPserver R 1024 bytes received and since this is the compressed AAC data, I would expect the decoding size will be approximately 1024 x11, however the actual result is AudioDecoderR 8192 bytes decoded It's approximately x8, and I feel something wrong. The decoder code is as follows:     IOudpPlayer = new Thread(new Runnable()
    {
        public void run()
        {
            SocketAddress sockAddress;
            String address;

            int inputBufferIndex;
            int outputBufferIndex;
            byte[] outData;
            try
            {
                decoder.start();
                isPlaying = true;
                while (isPlaying)
                {
                    try
                    {
                        packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer2, len);
                        ds.receive(packet);

                        sockAddress = packet.getSocketAddress();
                        address = sockAddress.toString();

                        Log.d("UDP Receiver"," received !!! from " + address);

                        data = new byte[packet.getLength()];
                        System.arraycopy(packet.getData(), packet.getOffset(), data, 0, packet.getLength());

                        Log.d("UDP Receiver",  data.length + " bytes received");

                            inputBuffer.clear();

                            inputBuffer.put(data);

                            decoder.queueInputBuffer(inputBufferIndex, 0, data.length, 0, 0);

                        while (outputBufferIndex >= 0)
                        {

 A member fadden who works for Google told me Looks like I'm not setting position & limit on the output buffer. I have read VP8 Encoding Nexus 5 returns empty/0-Frames , but not sure how to implement correctly. UPDATE: I sort of understood where to modify for Looks like I'm not setting position & limit on the output buffer. , so add 2 lines within the while loop of Encoder and Decoder as follows:  outputBuffer.position(bufferInfo.offset);
 outputBuffer.limit(bufferInfo.offset + bufferInfo.size);
 https://gist.github.com/kenokabe/9029256/revisions However the result is the same. and now, I think, the errors: W/SoftAAC2R AAC decoder returned error 16388, substituting silence. indicates this decoder fails completely from the first. It's again the data is not seekable issue. Seeking in AAC streams on Android It's very disappointing if the AAC decoder cannot handle the streaming data in this way but only with adding some header. UPDATE2: UDP receiver did wrong, so modified https://gist.github.com/kenokabe/9029256 Now, the error W/SoftAAC2R AAC decoder returned error 16388, substituting silence. disappeared!! So, it indicates the decoder works without an error, at least, however, this is the log of 1 cycle: D/AudioRecoderR 4096 bytes read
D/AudioEncoderR 360 bytes encoded
D/UDP ReceiverR received !!! from /127.0.0.1:39000
D/UDP ReceiverR 360 bytes received
D/AudioDecoderR 8192 bytes decoded
 PCM(4096)->AACencoded(360)->UDP-AAC(360)->(supposed to be )PCM(8192) The final result is about 2x size of the original PCM, something is still wrong. So my Question here would be Can you properly optimize my sample code to work correctly? Is it a right way to use AudioTrack API to play the decoded PCM raw data on the fly, and can you show me the proper way to do that? A example code is appreciated. Thank you. PS. My project targets on Android4.1+(API16), I've read things are easier on API18(Andeoid 4.3+), but for obvious compatibility reasons, unfortunately, I have to skip MediaMuxer etc. here...

@TITLE:HTML5 video player behavior on iPhone and iPod in Safari Web Apps
@CONTENT:On the iPhone and iPod, if a YouTube video is embedded in a web page, the user can touch the video and the video will start playingXthe iOS media player slides in and the video plays full screen in landscape orientation. Once the video has finished playing, the iOS media player slides back out, revealing the web page where the video was embedded. Using the HTML5 <video> tag, the user can touch the video and the video will "zoom" to full screen and start playing in whatever the current device orientation is. Once the video has finished playing, the user must tap once to bring up the player controls, and then tap "Done" in order to return to the web page. Unfortunately, uploading my videos to YouTube is not an option for this application, and I haven't found an HTML5 video player that returns to the website after the video is finished playing. I would prefer either that the video player exhibits the same behavior as the YouTube embedded videos, or that the video plays inline. Forcing inline video is possible in a customized UIWebView, but unfortunately that is not an option (as this is meant to be a web app, not a native app). Additionally, the <video> property webkit-playsinline does not work. Are there any HTML5 video players that can replicate the embedded YouTube video behavior? Am I missing any obvious Javascript workarounds? Is there a method to tell the window that the video is finished playing without user interaction? EDIT: Thanks to Jan, this problem is solved. Working code follows, along with a list of mistakes/notes. <!DOCTYPE html>

 Mistakes I made: 1. Forgot to add an ID in the <video> tag. 2. Testing for webkitSupportsFullscreenXI couldn't ever get that property to test as "true." A comment in code in this forum post says, // note: .webkitSupportsFullscreen is false while the video is loading
 but I was unable to create a condition in which it returned true. 3. Completely missed this stackoverflow post.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC RememberMe
@CONTENT:After searching a lot i did not get any answers and finally i had to get back to you. Below i am explaining my problem in detail. It's too long, so please don't quit reading. I have explained my problem in simple language. I have been developing an asp.net mvc project. I am using standard ASP.NET roles and membership. Everything is working fine but the remember me functionality doesn't work at all. I am listing all the details of work. Hope you guys can help me out solve this problem. I simply need this: I need user to login to web application. During login they can either login with remember me or without it. If user logs in with remember me, i want browser to remember them for long time, let's say atleast one year or considerably long time. The way they do it in www.dotnetspider.com,www.codeproject.com,www.daniweb.com and many other sites. If user logs in without remember me, then browser should allow access to website for some 20 -30 minutes and after that their session should expire. Their session should also expire when user logs in and shuts down the browser without logging out. Note: I have succesfully implemented above functionality without using standard asp.net roles and membership by creating my own talbes for user and authenticating against my database table, setting cookie and sessions in my other projects. But for this project we starting from the beginning used standard asp.net roles and membership. We thought it will work and after everything was build at the time of testing it just didn't work. and now we cannot replace the existing functionality with standard asp.net roles and membership with my own custom user tables and all the stuff, you understand what i am taling about. Either there is some kind of bug with standard asp.net roles and membership functionality or i have the whole concept of standard asp.net roles and membership wrong. i have stated what i want above. I think it's very simple and reasonable. What i did Login form with username,password and remember me field. My setting in web.config: <authentication mode="Forms"> <forms loginUrl="~/Account/LogOn" timeout="2880"/> </authentication> in My controller action, i have this: FormsAuth.SignIn(userName, rememberMe); public void SignIn(string userName, bool createPersistentCookie) { FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, createPersistentCookie); } Now the problems are following: I have already stated in above section "I simply need this". user can successfully log in to the system. Their session exists for as much minutes as specified in timeout value in web.config. I have also given a sample of my web.config. In my samplem if i set the timeout to 5 minutes,then user session expires after 5 minutes, that's ok. But if user closes the browser and reopen the browser, user can still enter the website without loggin in untill time specified in "timeout" has not passed out. The sliding expiration for timeout value is also working fine. Now if user logs in to the system with remember me checked, user session still expires after 5 minutes. This is not good behaviour, is it?. I mean to say that if user logs in to the system with remember me checked he should be remembered for a long time untill he doesn't logs out of the system or user doesn't manually deletes all the cookies from the browser. If user logs in to the system without remember me checked his session should expire after the timeout period values specified in web.config and also if users closes the browser. The problem is that if user closes the browser and reopens it he can still enter the website without logging in. I search internet a lot on this topic, but i could not get the solution. In the blog post(http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/11/08/430011.aspx) made by Scott Gu on exactly the same topic. The users are complaining about the same thing in their comments ut there is no easy solution given in by Mr. Scott. I read it at following places: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/11/08/430011.aspx http://geekswithblogs.net/vivek/archive/2006/09/14/91191.aspx I guess this is a problem of lot's of users. As seem from blog post made by Mr. Scott Gu. Your help will be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/1994018/measuring-velocity-via-iphone-sdk
@TITLE:Measuring velocity via iPhone SDK
@CONTENT:I need to implement a native iPhone app to measure the velocity of the phone (basically a speedometer). I know that you can do so via the CoreLocation API fairly easily, but I am concerned about battery consumption since this is to be a real-time measurement that could be used for up to a couple of hours at a time. My understanding is that while you are actively monitoring for events from the LocationManager (even though I don't actually care about GPS location) it is battery-intensive. The other obvious option to explore would be using the accelerometers to try and calculate speed, but there is nothing in the API to help you do so. Based on my research, it should be possible to do this, but seems extremely complicated and error-prone. Translating from acceleration to velocity can be tricky to begin with, plus the iPhone accelerometer data can be "noisy". I'm familiar with the SDK example that demonstrates using low/high pass filtering, etc. -- but I have not seen a good example anywhere that shows calculating velocity. Does anyone have any real-world experience with this they can share? Code would be fantastic, but really I just want to know if anyone has successfully done this (for a long-lived app) and what approach they took. EDIT: I've got a working prototype that uses the LocationManager API. It works OK, but the update cycle is far from ideal for a real-time measurement of velocity. Depending on circumstances, it can take up to 4-5 seconds sometimes to update. Cruising at a given speed tends to work OK, but accel/decel tend to lag very badly from a user interaction standpoint. Also, I need to feed velocity into some other calculations that I'm doing and the precision is not really what I need. It seems possible based on (very few) other apps I've seen, notably gMeter which claims to make no use of GPS but calculates velocity accurately. I'm really surprised there are no references or any sample code that demonstrates this anywhere that I can find. I realize it's complex, but surely there's something out there.

When there are 4 or more items I want the ScrollView to stop expanding (thus a maxHeight) and start providing scrolling. However, there is unfortunately no way to set a maxHeight. So I probably have to set my ScrollView height programmatically to either WRAP_CONTENT when there are 1..3 items and set the height to 3*sizeOf(View) when there are 4 or more items. Can anyone explain why there is no maxHeight provided, when there is already a minHeight? (BTW: some views, like ImageView have a maxHeight implemented.)

@TITLE:Limitations of Visual Studio 2012 Express Desktop
@CONTENT:I'm in the process of deciding whether or not to use Visual Studio 2012 Express for Desktop or purchase a retail copy of Visual Studio 2012 Professional for my desktop program. The program is built using C# though portions of it may include F#. From what I've gathered so far, the express edition supports NuGet, Unit Testing, and Code Analysis. It mentions a subset of Code Analysis rules are used but I'm unsure how they compare to the professional edition as well as FxCop/StyleCop. I'm assuming the express edition lacks extension support but the only extension I really cared about was NuGet. I also assume it doesn't include a TFS CAL despite having the ability to connect to TFS. This again isn't an issue as I'm using Perforce for source control. I also understand that this version is limited to desktop style applications only, but have so far only seen mention C++ and C#. Does it support F#? Can someone clue me in as to any other limitations of 2012 Express for Desktop? Are there any license limitations for developing a commercial application? In the past, MS included express editions as part of their version comparison. But when they updated their site for 2012, they separated out the express editions and offer little to no detail.

@CONTENT:Let me describe the problem in details: I want to show an absolute positioned div when hovering over an element. That's really simple with jQuery and works just fine. But when the mouse goes over one of the child elements, it triggers the mouseout event of the containing div. How do I keep javascript from triggering the mouseout event of the containing element when hovering a child element. What's the best and shortest way to do that with jQuery? Here is a simplified example to illustrate what I mean: Html: <a>Hover Me</a>
<div>
  <input>Test</input>
  <select>
    <option>Option 1</option>
    <option>Option 2</option>
  </select>

 Javascript/jQuery: $('a').hover( function() { $(this).next().show() }
              function() { $(this).next().hide() } );

<div>
  <input>Test</input>

@TITLE:Why doesn't Android use more enums?
@CONTENT:I've started to really like using C# and Java enums in my code for several reasons: They are much more type-safe than integers, strings, or sets of boolean flags. They lead to more readable code. It's more difficult to set an enum to an invalid value than an int or string. They make it easy to discover the allowed values for a variable or parameter. Everything I've read indicates that they perform just as well as integers in C# and most JVMs. However, the Android framework has numerous cases where flags of various types need to be passed around, but none of them seem to use enums. A couple of examples where I would think their use would be beneficial are Toast.LENGTH_SHORT / Toast.LENGTH_LONG and View.GONE, View.VISIBLE, etc. Why is this? Do enums perform worse than simple integer values in Dalvik? Is there some other drawback I'm not aware of?

@TITLE:How to quickly check if folder is empty (.NET)?
@CONTENT:I have to check, if directory on disk is empty. It means, that it does not contain any folders/files. I know, that there is a simple method. We get array of FileSystemInfo's and check if count of elements equals to zero. Something like that:     public static bool CheckFolderEmpty(string path)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path))
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("path");
        }

        var folder = new DirectoryInfo(path);
        if (folder.Exists)
        {
            return folder.GetFileSystemInfos().Length == 0;
        }

        throw new DirectoryNotFoundException();
    }
 This approach seems OK. BUT!! It is very, very bad from a perspective of performance. GetFileSystemInfos() is a very hard method. Actually, it enumerates all filesystem objects of folder, gets all their properties, creates objects, fills typed array etc. And all this just to simply check Length. That's stupid, isn't it? I just profiled such code and determined, that ~250 calls of such method are executed in ~500ms. This is very slow and I believe, that it is possible to do it much quicker. Any suggestions?
@CODE:public static bool CheckFolderEmpty(string path)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path))
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("path");
        }

        var folder = new DirectoryInfo(path);
        if (folder.Exists)
        {
            return folder.GetFileSystemInfos().Length == 0;
        }

        throw new DirectoryNotFoundException();
    }

 I searched for an answer here but didn't find any. How can I fix this? PS: This problem happened on ADT 23 - I tried it with ADT 22.6, and it worked well.

I understand that this tag is for form encryption, but what is the difference between <keygen> and having a SSL certificate for your domain. Also, what is the challenge attribute? I'm not planning on using it as it is far from implemented in an acceptable range of browsers, but I am curious as to what EXACTLY this tag does. All I can find is vague cookie-cutter documentation with no real examples of usage. Edit: I have found a VERY informative document, here. This runs through both client-side and server-side implementation of the keygen tag. I am still curious as to what the benefit of this over a domain SSL certificate would be.

@CONTENT:I have a TeamCity server setup to do my CI builds. I'm building and testing a C# solution and running some custom MSBuild tasks.

I don't understand what this means or how to remove it. It doesn't Google well (with or without the typo). I ran the task from the command line (with /verbosity:diagnostic) and it doesn't appear, so I believe it's a TeamCity message. The MSBuild task is <Target Name="InstallDb">

@TITLE:getting fatal: not a git repository: '.' when using post-update hook to execute 'git pull' on another repo
@CONTENT:I'm new to git so I apologize (and please correct me) if I misuse terminology here, but I'll do my best. I'm trying to set up a bare git repo (hub) and a development site working copy (prime) on a web server. I've tried to pattern it after this article. I want the development working copy to be updated whenever the hub repo is pushed to. I'm under the impression that the proper hook for this is post-update, which I have created like so: #!/bin/sh
whoami
cd /path/to/working-copy/
RET=`git pull`
echo $RET
 Update When I push changes from my local repo to the bare hub I get the following output from the post-update script: remote: sites
remote: fatal: Not a git repository: '.'
 However if I SSH into the server as user 'sites' and execute this script manually it works great Any ideas as to what might be going wrong with this hook or script?

@TITLE:Iterate over the lines of a string
@CONTENT:I have a multi-line string defined like this: foo = """

"""
 This string us used as test-input for a parser I am writing. The parser-function receives a file-object as input and iterates over it. It does also call the next() method directly to skip lines, so I really need an iterator as input, not an iterable. I need an iterator that iterates over the individual lines of that string like a file-object would over the lines of a text-file. I could of course do it like this: lineiterator = iter(foo.splitlines())
 Is there a more direct way of doing this? In this scenario the string has to traversed once for the splitting, and then again by the parser. It doesn't matter in my test-case, since the string is very short there, I am just asking out of curiosity. Python has so many useful and efficient built-ins for such stuff, but I could find nothing that suits this need.

@TITLE:google analytics - multiple trackers on one page (cookie conflict)
@CONTENT:I'm writing a web application that's supposed to be embedded in other people's websites (kind of a widget). I'm using Google Analytics to track all the people that visit all instances of my script on the embedding websites. The problem is that I don't know how to use it so that it doesn't interfere with those websites' own Google Analytics accounts. I'm storing the tracker variable in a namespace, so I thought that should do it, but I haven't realized that GA stores its settings in cookies (__utma, __utmz etc.), and those cookies are used by both trackers, if there are two of them on the same page... So for example if I use _setVar to store some kind of user-defined variable in Google Analytics, and the embedding site does the same, we overwrite each other's values... Of course it would be easiest if Google provided a way to change the name of the cookies to a custom one, but I can't find any way to do it. I thought about using cookie domain or path to force a separate cookie, but this doesn't work, because if I set domain or path to something other than the real domain/path, then the cookie is not readable for the page after reload... Does anyone know a way to have two trackers on one page and make them use separate cookies so that they don't overwrite each other's settings? Or, if that's completely impossible - is there any other analytics service with similar functionality as GA in which this is possible? (it would have to have advanced features like event and campaign tracking...)

@LINK:/questions/13150449/efficient-unsigned-to-signed-cast-avoiding-implementation-defined-behavior
@TITLE:Efficient unsigned-to-signed cast avoiding implementation-defined behavior
@CONTENT:I want to define a function that takes an unsigned int as argument and returns an int congruent modulo UINT_MAX+1 to the argument. A first attempt might look like this: int unsigned_to_signed(unsigned n)
{
    return static_cast<int>(n);
}
 But as any language lawyer knows, casting from unsigned to signed for values larger than INT_MAX is implementation-defined. I want to implement this such that (a) it only relies on behavior mandated by the spec; and (b) it compiles into a no-op on any modern machine and optimizing compiler. As for bizarre machines... If there is no signed int congruent modulo UINT_MAX+1 to the unsigned int, let's say I want to throw an exception. If there is more than one (I am not sure this is possible), let's say I want the largest one. OK, second attempt: int unsigned_to_signed(unsigned n)
{
    int int_n = static_cast<int>(n);

    if (n == static_cast<unsigned>(int_n))
        return int_n;

    // else do something long and complicated
}
 I do not much care about the efficiency when I am not on a typical twos-complement system, since in my humble opinion that is unlikely. And if my code becomes a bottleneck on the omnipresent sign-magnitude systems of 2050, well, I bet someone can figure that out and optimize it then. Now, this second attempt is pretty close to what I want. Although the cast to int is implementation-defined for some inputs, the cast back to unsigned is guaranteed by the standard to preserve the value modulo UINT_MAX+1. So the conditional does check exactly what I want, and it will compile into nothing on any system I am likely to encounter. However... I am still casting to int without first checking whether it will invoke implementation-defined behavior. On some hypothetical system in 2050 it could do who-knows-what. So let's say I want to avoid that. Question: What should my "third attempt" look like? To recap, I want to: Cast from unsigned int to signed int Preserve the value mod UINT_MAX+1 Invoke only standard-mandated behavior Compile into a no-op on a typical twos-complement machine with optimizing compiler [Update] Let me give an example to show why this is not a trivial question. Consider a hypothetical C++ implementation with the following properties: sizeof(int) equals 4 sizeof(unsigned) equals 4 INT_MAX equals 32767 INT_MIN equals -232 + 32768 UINT_MAX equals 232 - 1 Arithmetic on int is modulo 232 (into the range INT_MIN through INT_MAX) std::numeric_limits<int>::is_modulo is true Casting unsigned n to int preserves the value for 0 <= n <= 32767 and yields zero otherwise On this hypothetical implementation, there is exactly one int value congruent (mod UINT_MAX+1) to each unsigned value. So my question would be well-defined. I claim that this hypothetical C++ implementation fully conforms to the C++98, C++03, and C++11 specifications. I admit I have not memorized every word of all of them... But I believe I have read the relevant sections carefully. So if you want me to accept your answer, you either must (a) cite a spec that rules out this hypothetical implementation or (b) handle it correctly. Indeed, a correct answer must handle every hypothetical implementation permitted by the standard. That is what "invoke only standard-mandated behavior" means, by definition. Incidentally, note that std::numeric_limits<int>::is_modulo is utterly useless here for multiple reasons. For one thing, it can be true even if unsigned-to-signed casts do not work for large unsigned values. For another, it can be true even on one's-complement or sign-magnitude systems, if arithmetic is simply modulo the entire integer range. And so on. If your answer depends on is_modulo, it's wrong. [Update 2] hvd's answer taught me something: My hypothetical C++ implementation for integers is not permitted by modern C. The C99 and C11 standards are very specific about the representation of signed integers; indeed, they only permit twos-complement, ones-complement, and sign-magnitude (section 6.2.6.2 paragraph (2); ). But C++ is not C. As it turns out, this fact lies at the very heart of my question. The original C++98 standard was based on the much older C89, which says (section 3.1.2.5): For each of the signed integer types, there is a corresponding (but different) unsigned integer type (designated with the keyword unsigned) that uses the same amount of storage (including sign information) and has the same alignment requirements. The range of nonnegative values of a signed integer type is a subrange of the corresponding unsigned integer type, and the representation of the same value in each type is the same. C89 says nothing about only having one sign bit or only allowing twos-complement/ones-complement/sign-magnitude. The C++98 standard adopted this language nearly verbatim (section 3.9.1 paragraph (3)): For each of the signed integer types, there exists a corresponding (but different) unsigned integer type: "unsigned char", "unsigned short int", "unsigned int", and "unsigned long int", each of which occupies the same amount of storage and has the same alignment requirements (3.9) as the corresponding signed integer type ; that is, each signed integer type has the same object representation as its corresponding unsigned integer type. The range of nonnegative values of a signed integer type is a subrange of the corresponding unsigned integer type, and the value representation of each corresponding signed/unsigned type shall be the same. The C++03 standard uses essentially identical language, as does C++11. No standard C++ spec constrains its signed integer representations to any C spec, as far as I can tell. And there is nothing mandating a single sign bit or anything of the kind. All it says is that non-negative signed integers must be a subrange of the corresponding unsigned. So, again I claim that INT_MAX=32767 with INT_MIN=-232+32768 is permitted. If your answer assumes otherwise, it is incorrect unless you cite a C++ standard proving me wrong.

@TITLE:How to use support FileProvider for sharing content to other apps?
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to correctly share (not OPEN) an internal file with external application using Android Support library's FileProvider. Following the example on the docs, <provider
    android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
    android:authorities="com.example.android.supportv4.my_files"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true"
    android:exported="false">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/my_paths" />
</provider>
 and using ShareCompat to share a file to other apps as follows: ShareCompat.IntentBuilder.from(activity)
.setStream(uri) // uri from FileProvider
.setType("text/html")
.getIntent()
.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION)
 does not work, since the FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION only grants permission for the Uri specified on the data of the intent, not the value of the EXTRA_STREAM extra (as was set by setStream). I tried to compromise security by setting android:exported to true for the provider, but FileProvider internally checks if itself is exported, when so, it throws an exception.
@CODE:<provider
    android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
    android:authorities="com.example.android.supportv4.my_files"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true"
    android:exported="false">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/my_paths" />
</provider> ShareCompat.IntentBuilder.from(activity)
.setStream(uri) // uri from FileProvider
.setType("text/html")
.getIntent()
.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION) data EXTRA_STREAM setStream android:exported true FileProvider

@LINK:/questions/2017489/should-i-use-printf-in-my-c-code
@TITLE:Should I use printf in my C++ code?
@CONTENT:So I generally use cout and cerr to write text to the console. However sometimes I find it easier to use the good old printf statement. I use it when I need to format the output. So one example of where I would use this is: // Lets assume that I'm printing coordinates... 
printf("(%d,%d)\n", x, y);

// To do the same thing as above using cout....
cout << "(" << x << "," << y << ")" << endl;
 I know I can format output using cout but I already know how to use the printf. So is there any reason I shouldn't use the C printf statement?
@CODE:cout cerr printf // Lets assume that I'm printing coordinates... 
printf("(%d,%d)\n", x, y);

// To do the same thing as above using cout....
cout << "(" << x << "," << y << ")" << endl; cout printf printf printf fprintf endl printf("(%d,%d)\n", x, y); fflush(stdout); cout << "(" << x << "," << y << ")\n"; Mote

@TITLE:Maven Could not resolve dependencies, artifacts could not be resolved
@CONTENT:This is supposed to be a working project from my friend. He demonstrated the project right in front of me, and then I copied the project, imported it as an existing maven project (I'm using m2eclipse plugin). And then, this error occurs. This error can be reproduced every time I try to build something with maven. Doing mvn dependency:tree, dependency:list, or the usual build package, will result in the same error. The error from running the 'package' build from eclipse is: [INFO] Scanning for projects...

@TITLE:What is meaning of boolean value returned from an event-handling method in Android
@CONTENT:In android, most event listener methods return a boolean value. What is that true/false value mean ? what will it result in to the subsequence events ? class MyTouchListener implements OnTouchListener {
    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
        logView.showEvent(event);
        return true;
    }
}
 Regarding to the above example, if return true in onTouch method,I found every touch event(DOWN,UP,MOVE,etc) has been captured according to my logView. On the contrary,if return false, onely the DOWN event been captured. So it's seemd that return false will prevent the event to propagate. Am I correct ? Furthermore, in a OnGestureListener, many methods have to return a boolean value too. Do they have the same meaning ?
@CODE:class MyTouchListener implements OnTouchListener {
    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
        logView.showEvent(event);

@CONTENT:I've been trying to find a way to change the window.location.hash to the currently selected tab in Jquery UI Tabs. I've tried: $("#tabs > ul").tabs();
$("#tabs > ul").bind("tabsshow", function(event, ui) {

 This results in changing the hash to #undefined when the tab is changed. I've also tried: $("#tabs > ul").tabs({

window.location.hash = ui.tab }
});
 But this doesn't seem to be triggered at all. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. Edit: It looks like part of my initial problem had something to do with js somewhere else interfering with this. Both the accepted answer and the other suggested answer slightly modified do work. Thanks all.

@LINK:/questions/6643241/why-cant-you-have-multiple-interfaces-in-a-bounded-wildcard-generic
@TITLE:Why can't you have multiple interfaces in a bounded wildcard generic?
@CONTENT:I know there's all sorts of counter-intuitive properties of Java's generic types. Here's one in particular that I don't understand, and which I'm hoping someone can explain to me. When specifying a type parameter for a class or interface, you can bound it so that it must implement multiple interfaces with public class Foo<T extends InterfaceA & InterfaceB>. However, if you're instantiating an actual object, this doesn't work anymore. List<? extends InterfaceA> is fine, but List<? extends InterfaceA & InterfaceB> fails to compile. Consider the following complete snippet: import java.util.List;

public class Test {

  static interface A {
    public int getSomething();
  }

  static interface B {
    public int getSomethingElse();
  }

  static class AandB implements A, B {
    public int getSomething() { return 1; }
    public int getSomethingElse() { return 2; }
  }

  // Notice the multiple bounds here. This works.
  static class AandBList<T extends A & B> {
    List<T> list;

    public List<T> getList() { return list; }
  }

  public static void main(String [] args) {
    AandBList<AandB> foo = new AandBList<AandB>(); // This works fine!
    foo.getList().add(new AandB());
    List<? extends A> bar = new LinkedList<AandB>(); // This is fine too
    // This last one fails to compile!
    List<? extends A & B> foobar = new LinkedList<AandB>();
  }
}
 It seems the semantics of bar should be well-defined -- I can't think of any loss of type-safety by allowing an intersection of two types rather than just one. I'm sure there's an explanation though. Does anyone know what it is?
@CODE:public class Foo<T extends InterfaceA & InterfaceB> List<? extends InterfaceA> List<? extends InterfaceA & InterfaceB> import java.util.List;

public class Test {

  static interface A {
    public int getSomething();
  }

  static interface B {
    public int getSomethingElse();
  }

  static class AandB implements A, B {
    public int getSomething() { return 1; }
    public int getSomethingElse() { return 2; }
  }

  // Notice the multiple bounds here. This works.
  static class AandBList<T extends A & B> {
    List<T> list;

    public List<T> getList() { return list; }

@TITLE:Saving enum from select in Rails 4.1
@CONTENT:I am using the enums in Rails 4.1 to keep track of colors of wine. Wine.rb class Wine < ActiveRecord::Base
    enum color: [:red, :white, :sparkling]
end
 In my view, I generate a select so the user can select a wine with a certain color f.input :color, :as => :select, :collection => Wine.colors
 This generates the following HTML: <select id="wine_color" name="wine[color]">
  <option value=""></option>
  <option value="0">red</option>
  <option value="1">white</option>
  <option value="2">sparkling</option>
</select>
 However, upon submitting the form, I receive an argument error stating '1' is not a valid color. I realize this is because color must equal 1 and not "1". Is there a way to force Rails to interpret the color as an integer rather than a string?
@CODE:class Wine < ActiveRecord::Base
    enum color: [:red, :white, :sparkling]
end f.input :color, :as => :select, :collection => Wine.colors <select id="wine_color" name="wine[color]">

My guess is that those conditions grew so much because of later modifications. Anyway, I was wondering if any of you know of a good online simplifier I can use. I'm not interested in any specific language, just a simplifier that would take in for example: ((A OR B) AND (!B AND C) OR C) And give me a simplified version of the expression, if any. I've looked at the other similar questions but none point me to a good simplifier. Thanks.

@TITLE:Best way to read structured binary files with Java
@CONTENT:I have to read a binary file in a legacy format with Java. In a nutshell the file has a header consisting of several integers, bytes and fixed-length char arrays, followed by a list of records which also consist of integers and chars. In any other language I would create structs (C/C++) or records (Pascal/Delphi) which are byte-by-byte representations of the header and the record. Then I'd read sizeof(header) bytes into a header variable and do the same for the records. Something like this: (Delphi) type
  THeader = record
    Version: Integer;
    Type: Byte;
    BeginOfData: Integer;
    ID: array[0..15] of Char;
  end;

...

procedure ReadData(S: TStream);
var
  Header: THeader;
begin
  S.ReadBuffer(Header, SizeOf(THeader));
  ...
end;
 What is the best way to do something similar with Java? Do I have to read every single value on its own or is there any other way to do this kind of "block-read"?
@CODE:struct record sizeof(header) type
  THeader = record
    Version: Integer;
    Type: Byte;
    BeginOfData: Integer;

@CONTENT:I've created my own service and I need to inject doctrine EntityManager, but I don't see that __construct() is called on my service, and injection doesn't work. Here is the code and configs: <?php

class UserService {

    /**

        $this->em = $entityManager;
    }

    public function getUser($userId){
       var_dump($this->em ); // outputs null  
    }

}
 Here is services.yml in my bundle services:
  test.common.userservice:
    class:  Test\CommonBundle\Services\UserService
    arguments: 
        entityManager: "@doctrine.orm.entity_manager"
 I've imported that .yml in config.yml in my app like that imports:
    # a few lines skipped, not relevant here, i think
    - { resource: "@TestCommonBundle/Resources/config/services.yml" }
 And when I call service in controller     $userservice = $this->get('test.common.userservice');
    $userservice->getUser(123);
 I get an object (not null), but $this->em in UserService is null, and as I already mentioned, constructor on UserService has never been called One more thing, Controller and UserService are in different bundles (I really need that to keep project organized), but still: everyting else works fine, I can even call $this->get('doctrine.orm.entity_manager')
 in same controller that I use to get UserService and get valid (not null) EntityManager object. Look like that I'm missing piece of configuration or some link between UserService and Doctrine config.

@CONTENT:My searches keep turning up only guides explaining how to use and apply attributes to a class. I want to learn how to create my own attribute classes and the mechanics of how they work. How are attribute classes instantiated? Are they instantiated when the class they are applied to is instantiated? Is one instantiated for each class instantiated that it is applied to? E.g. if I apply the SerializableAttribute class to a MyData class, and I instantiate 5 MyData instances, will there be 5 instances of the SerializbleAttribute class created behind the scenes? Or is there just one instance shared between all of them? How do attribute class instances access the class they are associated with? How does a SerializableAttribute class access the class it is applied to so that it can serialize it's data? Does it have some sort of SerializableAttribute.ThisIsTheInstanceIAmAppliedTo property? :) Or does it work in the reverse direction that whenever I serialize something, the Serialize function I pass the MyClass instance to will reflectively go through the Attributes and find the SerialiableAttribute instance?

@TITLE:Get raw POST body in Python Flask regardless of Content-Type header
@CONTENT:So, while ago I asked similar question: How to get whole request POST body in Python (Flask) And I got an answer that actually flask.request.data is the raw POST BODY. But that seems to work only if the request has few additional headers: headers = {
    'Content-type': 'binary/octet-stream',
    'Content-length': len(postBody),
    'Content-transfer-encoding': 'binary',
}
 If those headers are not present, the flask.request.data will be empty: from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def parse_request():
    data = flask.request.data # but data will be empty unless the request has the proper content-type header...
 So now I found the request is actually application/x-www-form-urlencoded (which is default mimetype) then I could take the data like this: app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def parse_request():
    data = flask.request.data # but data will be empty unless the request has the proper content-type header...
    if not data:
        data = request.form.keys()[0]

@TITLE:How do Python properties work?
@CONTENT:I've been successfully using Python properties, but I don't see how they could work. If I dereference a property outside of a class, I just get an object of type property: @property
def hello(): return "Hello, world!"

hello  # <property object at 0x9870a8>
 But if I put a property in a class, the behavior is very different: class Foo(object):
   @property
   def hello(self): return "Hello, world!"

Foo().hello # 'Hello, world!'
 I've noticed that unbound Foo.hello is still the property object, so class instantiation must be doing the magic, but what magic is that?
@CODE:property @property
def hello(): return "Hello, world!"

hello  # <property object at 0x9870a8> class Foo(object):
   @property
   def hello(self): return "Hello, world!"

Foo().hello # 'Hello, world!' Foo.hello property

@LINK:/questions/4624071/pipe-buffer-size-is-4k-or-64k
@TITLE:Pipe buffer size is 4k or 64k?
@CONTENT:I read in multiple places that the default buffer size for a pipe is 4kB (for instance, here), and my ulimit -a tends to confirm that statement: $ ulimit -a
core file size          (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited
scheduling priority             (-e) 0
file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited
pending signals                 (-i) 15923
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64
max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                      (-n) 1024
pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8 // 8 * 512B = 4kB
POSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200
real-time priority              (-r) 0
stack size              (kbytes, -s) 10240
cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes              (-u) 1024
virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited
file locks                      (-x) unlimited
 But when I use a little program to test the buffer size (by writing into the pipe until the write() blocks), I see a limit of 64kB! See this program: #include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main(void)
{
    int tube[2];
    char c = 'c';
    int i;

    fprintf(stdout, "Tube Creation\n");
    fprintf(stdout, "Theoretical max size: %d\n", PIPE_BUF);
    if( pipe(tube) != 0)
    {
        perror("pipe");
        _exit(1);
    }
    fprintf(stdout, "Writing in pipe\n");
    for(i=0;; i++)
    {
        fprintf(stdout, "%d bytes written\n", i+1);
        if( write(tube[1], &c, 1) != 1)
        {
            perror("Write");
            _exit(1);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
 And its output: $ ./test_buf_pipe 
Tube Creation

Writing in pipe
1 bytes written
2 bytes written
3 bytes written
4 bytes written
[...]

 It strongly suggests that the pipe buffer size is actually 64k! What is happening here??

@TITLE:Angular JS: How to load js files in partials
@CONTENT:Very new to AngularJS, I am guessing the term for what I am trying to do is lazy load. I have looked at several different blogs and I have not found a complete working solution that is purely using AngularJS. I understand that if I put the <script src="js/process1.js"></script> in index.html, all works fine, I am trying to cut down on the amount of js that is pulled down on the initial load. With the script tag sitting in the partial, it is never loaded so the P1Ctrl is never created. So currently, if a user go into the application and never goes to process55, the user still has the code there for process55 even though it was never used. Is there a way to load the file and inject the objects created in the process1.js into the app defined in main, at the time process1 route is executed? index.html:     <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

@TITLE:Post UTF-8 encoded data to server loses certain characters
@CONTENT:I am working on project which includes communication of the server (JavaEE app) and client (Android app). XML is sent as one of POST parameters of the HTTP request (named "xml"). There are also few other POST parameters which I pass to server, but in function below I removed them for simplicity. Problem that occurs is that certain letters are not properly delivered to the server - for example character ? (Note that this is not German ?, which is properly delivered, by the way). Code for sending is the following: private String postSyncXML(String XML) {
    String url = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/DebugServlet/DebugServlet";
    HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();  

    List<NameValuePair> nameValuePairs = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();
    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair("xml",XML));

    UrlEncodedFormEntity form;
    try {
        form = new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs);
                form.setContentEncoding(HTTP.UTF_8);
        HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(url);

        httppost.setEntity(form);

        HttpResponse response = (HttpResponse) httpclient .execute(httppost);
        HttpEntity resEntity = response.getEntity();  
        String resp = EntityUtils.toString(resEntity);
        Log.i(TAG,"postSyncXML srv response:"+resp);
        return resp;
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {

        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;
}
 My guess is that problem is in the BasicNameValuePair I use to set XML as one of POST parameters, and it's documentation says it uses US-ASCII character set. What is the proper way to send UTF-8 encoded POST fields?
@CODE:? ? private String postSyncXML(String XML) {

@TITLE:search for interval overlap in list of intervals?
@CONTENT:Say [a,b] represents the interval on the real line from a to b, a < b, inclusive (ie, [a,b] = set of all x such that a<=x<=b). Also, say [a,b] and [c,d] are 'overlapping' if they share any x such that x is in both [a,b] and [c,d]. Given a list of intervals, ([x1,y1],[x2,y2],...), what is the most efficient way to find all such intervals that overlap with [x,y]? Obviously, I can try each and get it in O(n). But I was wondering if I could sort the list of intervals in some clever way, I could find /one/ overlapping item in O(log N) via a binary search, and then 'look around' from that position in the list to find all overlapping intervals. However, how do I sort intervals such that such a strategy would work? Note that there may be overlaps between elements in the list items itself, which is what makes this hard. I've tried it by sorting intervals by their left end, right end, middle, but none seem to lead to an exhaustive search. Help?

@TITLE:Extracting text from a contentEditable div
@CONTENT:I have a div set to contentEditable and styled with "white-space:pre" so it keeps things like linebreaks. In Safari, FF and IE, the div pretty much looks and works the same. All is well. What I want to do is extract the text from this div, but in such a way that will not lose the formatting -- specifically, the line breaks. We are using jQuery, whose text() function basically does a pre-order DFS and glues together all the content in that branch of the DOM into a single lump. This loses the formatting. I had a look at the html() function, but it seems that all three browsers do different things with the actual HTML that gets generated behind the scenes in my contentEditable div. Assuming I type this into my div: 1
2
3
 These are the results: Safari 4: 1
<div>2</div>
<div>3</div>
 Firefox 3.6: 1
<br _moz_dirty="">
2
<br _moz_dirty="">
3
<br _moz_dirty="">
<br _moz_dirty="" type="_moz">
 IE 8: <P>1</P><P>2</P><P>3</P>
 Ugh. Nothing very consistent here. The surprising thing is that MSIE looks the most sane! (Capitalized P tag and all) The div will have dynamically set styling (font face, colour, size and alignment) which is done using CSS, so I'm not sure if I can use a pre tag (which was alluded to on some pages I found using Google). Does anyone know of any JavaScript code and/or jQuery plugin or something that will extract text from a contentEditable div in such a way as to preserve linebreaks? I'd prefer not to reinvent a parsing wheel if I don't have to. Update: I cribbed the getText function from jQuery 1.4.2 and modified it to extract it with whitespace mostly intact (I only chnaged one line where I add a newline); function extractTextWithWhitespace( elems ) {
    var ret = "", elem;

    for ( var i = 0; elems[i]; i++ ) {
        elem = elems[i];

        // Get the text from text nodes and CDATA nodes
        if ( elem.nodeType === 3 || elem.nodeType === 4 ) {
            ret += elem.nodeValue + "\n";

        // Traverse everything else, except comment nodes
        } else if ( elem.nodeType !== 8 ) {
            ret += extractTextWithWhitespace2( elem.childNodes );
        }
    }

    return ret;
}
 I call this function and use its output to assign it to an XML node with jQuery, something like: var extractedText = extractTextWithWhitespace($(this));
var $someXmlNode = $('<someXmlNode/>');
$someXmlNode.text(extractedText);
 The resulting XML is eventually sent to a server via an AJAX call. This works well in Safari and Firefox. On IE, only the first '\n' seems to get retained somehow. Looking into it more, it looks like jQuery is setting the text like so (line 4004 of jQuery-1.4.2.js): return this.empty().append( (this[0] && this[0].ownerDocument || document).createTextNode( text ) );
 Reading up on createTextNode, it appears that IE's implementation may mash up the whitespace. Is this true or am I doing something wrong?

@LINK:/questions/203475/how-do-i-identify-immutable-objects-in-java
@TITLE:How do I identify immutable objects in Java
@CONTENT:In my code, I am creating a collection of objects which will be accessed by various threads in a fashion that is only safe if the objects are immutable. When an attempt is made to insert a new object into my collection, I want to test to see if it is immutable (if not, I'll throw an exception). One thing I can do is to check a few well-known immutable types: private static final Set<Class> knownImmutables = new HashSet<Class>(Arrays.asList(
        String.class, Byte.class, Short.class, Integer.class, Long.class,
        Float.class, Double.class, Boolean.class, BigInteger.class, BigDecimal.class
));

...

public static boolean isImmutable(Object o) {
    return knownImmutables.contains(o.getClass());
}
 This actually gets me 90% of the way, but sometimes my users will want to create simple immutable types of their own: public class ImmutableRectangle {
    private final int width;
    private final int height;
    public ImmutableRectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    public int getWidth() { return width; }
    public int getHeight() { return height; }
}
 Is there some way (perhaps using reflection) that I could reliably detect whether a class is immutable? False positives (thinking it's immutable when it isn't) are not acceptable but false negatives (thinking it's mutable when it isn't) are. Edited to add: Thanks for the insightful and helpful answers. As some of the answers pointed out, I neglected to define my security objectives. The threat here is clueless developers -- this is a piece of framework code that will be used by large numbers of people who know next-to-nothing about threading and won't be reading the documentation. I do NOT need to defend against malicious developers -- anyone clever enough to mutate a String or perform other shenanigans will also be smart enough to know it's not safe in this case. Static analysis of the codebase IS an option, so long as it is automated, but code reviews cannot be counted on because there is no guarantee every review will have threading-savvy reviewers.

@TITLE:Programmatically register HttpModules at runtime
@CONTENT:I'm writing an app where 3rd party vendors can write plugin DLLs and drop them into the web app's bin directory. I want the ability for these plugins to be able to register their own HttpModules if necessary. Is there anyway that I can add or remove HttpModules from and to the pipeline at runtime without having a corresponding entry in the Web.Config, or do I have to programmatically edit the Web.Config when adding / removing modules? I know that either way is going to cause an AppDomain restart but I'd rather be able to do it in code than having to fudge the web.config to achieve the same effect.

@TITLE:Creating a percentage based iOS layout
@CONTENT:I'm trying to replicate a layout that I currently have in an Android application, but I don't know how to go about it in iOS especially because of the tallness of the iPhone 5. I know how to explain this in "Android" terms but I've been trying for the past few days to do this in iOS but I can't quite get it to work. Best way to explain it: I want two layouts. The top layout must take up 40% and the bottom must take up 60%. In the top layout, they must be three buttons that fill up all space possible (Essentially 1/3 of the space) In the bottom layout, I want an imageView, and then a textView on top of that. This is a paint mockup. Is this possible to do in iOS? I feel that layouts are much harder to create than android.

@TITLE:How do you get implicit dependencies to work with workspaces in Xcode 4?
@CONTENT:I want to manage projects in workspaces using Xcode 4 with Cocoa Touch Static Library projects which contain shared code that I could reference from other projects. According to WWDC 2010 videos and the Xcode 4 documentation there is a feature for "implicit dependencies" for workspaces in Xcode 4. I have been trying to make it work and I am not having much success. Sample Workspace: DependenciesInXcode4.zip You can see the very basic sample project has 2 static library projects which I named Library1 and Library2. I then have a single class in each project which I reference from the iPhone project called PrimaryApp. I get support from Code Sense when adding the import statement but the build fails. You can see how the build fails because it cannot find the dependencies. To resolve these issues I added manually linked the Library1 and Library2 projects. I also had to add the path to these projects as Header Search Paths. Now when I build both of the dependency libraries and then run PrimaryApp in the iPhone Simulator it builds successfully and runs. I have found that it does not always ensure that the dependency projects are built when necessary and this is clearly a manual process. This is not what I consider "implicit dependencies" as the Xcode videos and documentation imply that it should work. I have been looking for more concrete examples but so far I have had no luck. Even here on Stackoverflow I do not see a satisfactory answer yet. How should I manage dependencies across projects in an Xcode workspace? What's the correct way to configure XCode 4 workspaces to build dependencies when needed? It appears that developers are falling back to old techniques and not truly using the new "implicit dependencies" features. I'd appreciate some help with understanding how to get "implicit dependencies" to work with workspaces in Xcode 4. Here are my questions: How are "implicit dependencies" supposed to work in Xcode 4 with workspaces? Why can't the code in Libary1 and Library2 be found automatically in PrimaryApp? Are additional changes required to make dependencies work in a workspace?

I know I can use the modulus operator to see whether a number is even or odd and prime or composite, but that's about it. I don't often think in terms of remainders. I'm sure the modulus operator is useful, and I would like to learn to take advantage of it. I just have problems identifying where the modulus operator is applicable.

@TITLE:How to get Floating DIVs inside fixed-width DIV to continue horizontally?
@CONTENT:I have a container DIV with a fixed height and width (275x1000px). In this DIV I want to put multiple floating DIVs each with a width of 300px, and have a horizontal (x-axis) scrollbar appear to allow the user to scroll left and right to view everything. This is my CSS so far: div#container {
    height: 275px;
    width: 1000px;
    overflow-x: auto;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    max-height: 275px;
}

div#container div.block {
    float: left;
    margin: 3px 90px 0 3px;
}
 The problem is that the floating DIVs will not continue past the width of the container. After putting three of the floating DIV's they will continue on beneath. If I change overflow-y to auto, then the vertical scrollbar appears and I can scroll down. How can I change this to make the floating DIVs continue on without going beneath each other?
@CODE:div#container {
    height: 275px;

@TITLE:How to set the runtime path (-rpath) of an executable with gcc under Mac OSX?
@CONTENT:I want to set under Mac OSX the runtime path of an executable (for the linker) at compile time, such that shared libraries at non-standard locations are found by the dynamic linker at program start. Under Linux this is possible with -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker /path/to (or using -Wl,-path,/path/to) and under Solaris you can add -R/path/to to the compiler command line. I found some information that Mac OS X gcc has -rpath support since 1.5 - which is perhaps ~ 2 years old, now. I tried to get it working with a minimal example - without success: $ cat blah.c 
int blah(int b)
{
  return b+1;
}
 And: $ cat main.c 

#include <stdio.h>

int blah(int);

int main ()
{
  printf("%d\n", blah(22));
  return 0;
}
 Compiled it like this: $ gcc -c  blah.c
$ gcc -dynamiclib blah.o -o libblah.dylib
$ gcc main.c -lblah -L`pwd`  -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker `pwd`/t
 Now the test: $ mkdir t
$ mv libblah.dylib t
$ ./a.out
dyld: Library not loaded: libblah.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/max/test/./a.out
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap
 Thus the question: How to I set the runtime path for the linker under Mac OSX? Btw, setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH works - but I don't want to use this hack. Edit: Regarding otool -L: $ otool -L a.out 
a.out:
        libblah.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.2.1)
 It seems that otool -L only prints the library names (and probable the locations at link time) the executable was linked against and no runtime path information.

I have, of course, included references to Office.interop.word, and the site works fine on my development machine. When I uploaded it to my production server the site functions fine until I try to upload a document. I initially got a similar error that said "COM object not registered". I realized that Word wasn't installed on my production server. So I installed word and now when the server tries to access the word object model I receive the following error: Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {000209FF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} failed due to the following error: 80070005 Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED)) I searched the registry for the corresponding CLSID and found a corresponding folder. I added full control to the IUSR_ account and due to the persistence of the error I eventually added full control to "everyone" and ensured these permissions inherited down to the rest of the folder. I then added full control to IUSR_ and again eventually added full control to "everyone" to my microsoft office folder. I don't know what other permissions to grant and where in order to make this "Access is denied" error go away. I must be granting them in the wrong place, because as far as I know I can't be any more permissive than "Everyone" "Full Control". Can anyone shed any light?

@CONTENT:I need to filter an array to remove the elements that are lower than a certain threshold. My current code is like this: threshold = 5
a = numpy.array(range(10)) # testing data
b = numpy.array(filter(lambda x: x >= threshold, a))
 The problem is that this creates a temporary list, using a filter with a lambda function (slow). As this is a quite simple operation, maybe there is a numpy function that does it in an efficient way, but I've been unable to find it. I've thought that another way to achieve this could be sorting the array, finding the index of the threshold and returning a slice from that index onwards, but even if this would be faster for small inputs (and it won't be noticeable anyway), its definitively asymptotically less efficient as the input size grows. Any ideas? Thanks! Update: I took some measurements too, and the sorting+slicing was still twice as fast than the pure python filter when the input was 100.000.000 entries. In [321]: r = numpy.random.uniform(0, 1, 100000000)

In [322]: %timeit test1(r) # filter
1 loops, best of 3: 21.3 s per loop

In [323]: %timeit test2(r) # sort and slice
1 loops, best of 3: 11.1 s per loop

In [324]: %timeit test3(r) # boolean indexing
1 loops, best of 3: 1.26 s per loop
@CODE:threshold = 5
a = numpy.array(range(10)) # testing data
b = numpy.array(filter(lambda x: x >= threshold, a)) In [321]: r = numpy.random.uniform(0, 1, 100000000)

@CONTENT:I am working on a PHP project which makes extensive use of the MVC design pattern. I am looking to add validation to a form and am curious as to what the right place for validation is. Due to the way that forms are generated, validation on postback data is a lot simpler and less repetitive in view components. Is it acceptable to have the view validating response data, or should this be implemented within the controller, or even the model? What are the benefits?

@TITLE:Draw a circle of 1000m radius around users location in MKMapView
@CONTENT:(Using iOS 5 and Xcode 4.2) I have an MKMapView and want to draw a circle of 1000m radius around the user location. On the surface it would seem that implementing the mapView:viewForAnnotation: map view delegate method, and adding a custom MKAnnotationView for the users location, would be a perfect solution. It would look something like this: - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView
            viewForAnnotation:(id <MKAnnotation>)annotation
{
    // If it's the user location, return my custom MKAnnotationView.
    if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[MKUserLocation class]]) {
        return myCustomAnnotationView;
    } else {
        return nil;
    }
}
 However annotations on the map don't scale when you zoom in and out of the map. So I tried adding an overlay (because overlays scale with the map), using the MKCircle class and setting its co-ordinates to the latest co-ordinates from my locationManger/map view delegate. However as the coordinate property of MKCircle is readonly, I'm having to remove the overlay then add a new one each time the user moves. Causing a noticeable flicker as it happens. Is there any way to make an annotation scale seamlessly as the map view is scaled in and out? Or is there a good way to make an overlay move seamlessly with changes in the users location? I would be very grateful for your help :)
@CODE:- (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView
            viewForAnnotation:(id <MKAnnotation>)annotation
{
    // If it's the user location, return my custom MKAnnotationView.
    if ([annotation isKindOfClass:[MKUserLocation class]]) {
        return myCustomAnnotationView;
    } else {

This directory can better be thought as media/shared storage... In devices with multiple 'external' storage directories... , this directory represents the 'primary' external storage that the user will interact with." My app writes files to the path obtained by getExternalStorageDirectory, and I've had users ask for an option to write to their removable SD card instead. I had always assumed that getExternalStorageDirectory returned the path to the removable SD card, but this is no longer true. How do I access the path to this SD card?

@LINK:/questions/22644328/when-is-the-thread-pool-used
@TITLE:When is the thread pool used?
@CONTENT:So I have an understanding of how Node.js works: it has a single listener thread that receives an event and then delegates it to a worker pool. The worker thread notifies the listener once it completes the work, and the listener then returns the response to the caller. My question is this: if I stand up an HTTP server in Node.js and call sleep on one of my routed path events (such as "/test/sleep"), the whole system comes to a halt. Even the single listener thread. But my understanding was that this code is happening on the worker pool. Now, by contrast, when I use Mongoose to talk to MongoDB, DB reads are an expensive I/O operation. Node seems to be able to delegate the work to a thread and receive the callback when it completes; the time taken to load from the DB does not seem to block the system. How does Node.js decide to use a thread pool thread vs the listener thread? Why can't I write event code that sleeps and only blocks a thread pool thread?

@TITLE:jQuery CORS Content-type OPTIONS
@CONTENT:I have issue with sending AJAX body request using jQuery CORS with custom Content-type. Here's my code: $.ajax({
  url: "http://some-other-domain/my-path",
  type: "POST",
  contentType: "application/json",
  dataType: "json",
  data: JSON.stringify({
    key: 1,
    key2: 2
  }),
  statusCode: {
    200: function(data) {
    }
  },
  xhrFields: {
    withCredentials: true
  },
  crossDomain: true
});
 I need to set Content-type as "application/json" as it's require server side. But instead of sending request as POST jQuery sends it's as OPTIONS. Here's a headers: Response Headers: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

 CORS works great, all required headers are sends by server, but not if it sends by OPTIONS type. Is it jQuery issue? jQuery - 1.8.1

@TITLE:Dynamic Lang. Runtime vs Reflection
@CONTENT:I am planning to use dynamic keyword for my new project. But before stepping in, I would like to know about the pros and cons in using dynamic keyword over Reflection. Following where the pros, I could find in respect to dynamic keyword: Readable\Maintainable code. Fewer lines of code. While the negatives associated with using dynamic keyword, I came to hear was like: Affects application performance. Dynamic keyword is internally a wrapper of Reflection. Dynamic typing might turn into breeding ground for hard to find bugs. Affects interoperability with previous .NET versions. Please help me on whether the pros and cons I came across are sensible or not?

@TITLE:Variations of sed between OSX and GNU/Linux
@CONTENT:I've got a makefile (developed for gmake on Linux) that I'm attempting to port to OSX, but it seems like sed doesn't want to cooperate. What I do is use GCC to autogenerate dependency files, and then tweak them a bit using sed. The relevant portion of the makefile: $(OBJ_DIR)/%.d: $(SRC_DIR)/%.cpp
  $(CPPC) -MM -MD $< -o $@
  sed -i 's|\(.*\)\.o:|$(OBJ_DIR)/\1.o $(OBJ_DIR)/\1.d $(TEST_OBJ_DIR)/\1_utest.o:|' $@
 While this runs with no trouble under GNU/Linux, I get errors like the following when attempting to build on OSX: sed: 1: "test/obj/equipmentConta ...": undefined label 'est/obj/equipmentContainer_utest.d'
sed: 1: "test/obj/dice_utest.d": undefined label 'est/obj/dice_utest.d'
sed: 1: "test/obj/color-string_u ...": undefined label 'est/obj/color-string_utest.d'
 It would seem like sed is chopping off a character, but I can't see the solution. Thanks in advance, Cheers!

@TITLE:Best practices for managing and deploying large JavaScript apps
@CONTENT:What are some standard practices for managing a medium-large JavaScript application? My concerns are both speed for browser download and ease and maintainability of development. Our JavaScript code is roughly "namespaced" as: var Client = {
   var1: '',
   var2: '',

   accounts: {
      /* 100's of functions and variables */
   },

   orders: {
      /* 100's of functions and variables and subsections */
   }

   /* etc, etc  for a couple hundred kb */
}
 At the moment, we have one (unpacked, unstripped, highly readable) JavaScript file to handle all the business logic on the web application. In addition, there is jQuery and several jQuery extensions. The problem we face is that it takes forever to find anything in the JavaScript code and the browser still has a dozen files to download. Is it common to have a handful of "source" JavaScript files that gets "compiled" into one final, compressed JavaScript file? Any other handy hints or best practices?
@CODE:var Client = {
   var1: '',
   var2: '',

   accounts: {

I know that lazy sequences only evaluate the items in the sequence that are asked for, how does it do this? What makes lazy sequences so efficient that they don't consume much stack? How come you can wrap recursive calls in a lazy sequence and no longer get a stack over flow for large computations? What resources do lazy sequences consume to do what it does?

@TITLE:Looking for a JQuery plug-in similar to Accordian, but that allows multiple sections open at once [closed]
@CONTENT:I am looking to have a UI element similar to that offered by the JQUERY Accordian plug-in, but allowing the user to keep multiple sections open at once. The documentation has the following to say, and suggests an alternate approach with a code snippet (see below). That is great and all, and the code they provide basically works, but I find myself recreating a lot of things built into the plugin like switching out the classes and applying the themes manually in the XHTML. My Questions: Before I get too far along the manual route, does anyone know of a similar plug-in, or mod to this one to allow multiple panels to be open at once? Is there a another common name for an accordion-like control that allows multiple open panels that I could use to Google for other options? Here is the part I referenced earlier from the documentation, if it matters. NOTE: If you want multiple sections open at once, don't use an accordion An accordion doesn't allow more than one content panel to be open at the same time, and it takes a lot of effort to do that. If you are looking for a widget that allows more than one content panel to be open, don't use this. Usually it can be written with a few lines of jQuery instead, something like this: jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    $('.accordion .head').click(function() {
    	$(this).next().toggle();
    	return false;
    }).next().hide();
});

Or animated:

jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    $('.accordion .head').click(function() {
    	$(this).next().toggle('slow');
    	return false;
    }).next().hide();

@TITLE:remove key press delay in javascript
@CONTENT:I have the following problem: I'm trying to write a javascript game, and the character is being controlled by the arrow keys. The problem is, when one keeps the key pressed, there is a short delay between firing the first keypress and the repeated kepress. Also, when one presses the "right arrow key" and keeps it pressed, and then presses the "up arrow key" the character doesn't move to the top right corner, but stops the moving in the right direction and starts moving up. This is the code I'm using: <body onLoad="Load()" onKeyDown="Pressed(event)">
 
function Pressed(e) { 
        cxc = e.keyCode;
        if(cxc == 37)

@TITLE:Converting a Mercurial (hg) repository to Git on Windows (7)
@CONTENT:I'm really quite frustrated at this point. I have an existing hg repository that has months of coding history in it, and I want to get this into a private Github repository so I can work on it from there. Unfortunately I use Windows and I can't seem to find any way to convert the repository that I can actually get to work properly. Practically every bit of help and advice I can find online seems to assume I'm running from some kind *nix shell, which I'm not. I currently have installed: TortoiseHG, Python 3.1 and Git for Windows. What I've tried: hg-init plugin for hg - When I try to use the gexport command (and others from hg-git), I just get strings of python exceptions. I totally can't get git to even recognise the gremote command. I tried following what was here: http://github.com/blog/439-hg-git-mercurial-plugin hg-to-git (fast-export) - All tutorials keep expecting me to run a .sh file. Another stackoverflow thread seemed to imply that Powershell can run .sh files, but I can't make it run them for the life of me. Example: http://hivelogic.com/articles/converting-from-mercurial-to-git Mercurial to git converter - http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/36601 - This one doesn't want to work when I run it via Python, which complains that it has a syntax error on line 44. I don't know python, so I've got no idea. Four hours of Google searching and wading through useless tutorials and people-more-fortunate-than-me singing the praises of each supposedly-helpful blog post, but I haven't gotten anywhere with this. Can anyone offer any assistance or suggestions for me to try?

@TITLE:Google Maps Android API v2 very slow when adding lots of Markers
@CONTENT:I am updating an existing Android app to use the new Google Maps Android API v2. I have about 2500 markers that I want to add to the map. With the older version of the API I found the responsiveness of the maps to be horrendous when there are 2500 markers, so I had to work around it by only adding markers that are in the current visible region of the map. I was hoping 2500 markers would be faster with the new API, but it's still awful, even on a Nexus 4, and I'm not seeing any sort of option to do clustering. So my question: how can I determine if a certain lat/lng point is contained within the visible region of the map? I have looked at VisibleRegion in the documentation, but I've not had any luck with it so far. Any help is greatly appreciated. *Side note: 2500 markers on an iOS MKMapView (google maps or Apple maps) is very smooth and responsive even with an iPhone 3gs. I still can't understand why it's so slow on Android, even with the latest and greatest hardware.

@TITLE:Can you Distribute a Ruby on Rails Application without Source?
@CONTENT:I'm wondering if it's possible to distribute a RoR app for production use without source code? I've seen this post on SO, but my situation is a little different. This would be an app administered by people with some clue, so I'm cool with still requiring an Apache/Mongrel/MySQL setup on the customer end. All I really want is for the source to be protected. Encoding seems a popular way to go for distributing PHP apps (eg: Helpspot). I've found these potential solutions: Zenobfuscate - not all types of Ruby code is supported however, so that counts that out Ruby Encoder - may be the best option, as their PHP encoder looks alright (I haven't tried it however) but it's not available yet. I've used IONcube for PHP before and it worked well, but it doesn't seem that IONcube is interested yet. Slingshot - it was mentioned in the other SO post, but it solves a different problem to mine and the source is still visible. RubyScript2Exe - from the doco, it's not production ready, so that counts that out. I've heard that potentially using JRuby and distributing bytecode might be a way to achieve this, but I've never used JRuby so I'm not sure what's involved. Can anyone offer any ideas and/or known examples? Ideally I'd love to have some kind of automated build scenario as well.

@TITLE:Django - Working with multiple forms
@CONTENT:What I'm trying to do is to manage several forms in one page, I know there are formsets, and I know how the form management works, but I got some problems with the idea I have in mind. Just to help you to imagine what my problem is I'm going to use the django example models: from django.db import models

class Poll(models.Model):
    question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField()

class Choice(models.Model):
    poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)
    choice = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
 Now, imagine I've already made the form clases: from django import forms
from mysite.polls.models import Poll, Choice

class PollForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Poll

class ChoiceForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Choice
        exclude = ('poll',) 
 So what I want to do is to have several form instances of the Poll and Choice model in a single page, but mind that these models can be repeated too: <form action="{{url}}" method="post">
    {{pollform}}
    {{choiceform}}
    {{pollform}}
</form>
 As you can see there are two Poll forms and one Choice form, but the Poll forms are separated by the Choice form. I do need that the forms keep their order in the page, so is a little harder to use formsets. The problem I got, is that the values that comes in the post are all by the name "answer", so I get a list of all the elements from all forms by the name "answer" and I can't identify which ones belong to each form. Don't know if this explanation get a clear view of my problem. Any ideas to get this stuff done? Thanks for your help! PD: Don't pay attention to the relation between Poll and Choice, those models are just to clarify the problen, so the relation doesn't matter at all.

class Poll(models.Model):
    question = models.CharField(max_length=200)

@TITLE:Loading/Unloading assembly in different AppDomain
@CONTENT:I need to execute a method in an assembly loaded during runtime. Now I want to unload those loaded assemblies after the method call. I know that I need a new AppDomain so I can unload the libraries. But here, the problem arises. The assemblies going to load are plugins in my plugin framework. They have no entry point at all. All I know is that they contain some types which implement a given interface. The old, non-AppDomain-code looks like this (slightly shortened): try
{
    string path = Path.GetFullPath("C:\library.dll");
    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve;
    Assembly asm = Assembly.LoadFrom(path);
    Type[] types = asm.GetExportedTypes();
    foreach (Type t in types)
    {
        if ((t.GetInterface("IStarter") != null) && !t.IsAbstract)
        {
            object tempObj = Activator.CreateInstance(t);
            MethodInfo info = t.GetMethod("GetParameters");
            if (info != null)
            {
                return info.Invoke(tempObj, null) as string;
            }
        }
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    MessageBox.Show(String.Format("Damn '{0}'.", ex.Message), "Exception", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
}

private Assembly CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args)
{
    if (args.Name.StartsWith("MyProject.View,"))
    {
        string path = Path.GetFullPath("C:\view.dll"));
        return Assembly.LoadFrom(path);
    }
    return null;
}
 Now I want them to load in an own AppDomain: try
{
    string path = Path.GetFullPath("C:\library.dll");
    AppDomain domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain("TempDomain");
    domain.AssemblyResolve += CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve;  // 1. Exception here!!
    domain.ExecuteAssembly(path);  // 2. Exception here!!
    domain.CreateInstanceFrom(...);  // 3. I have NO clue, how the type is named.
    domain.Load(...);  // 4. I have NO clue, how the assembly is named.
    domain.DoCallBack(...); // 5. Exception here!!
    // ...
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    MessageBox.Show(String.Format("Damn '{0}'.", ex.Message), "Exception", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
}
 As you can see, I have put in 5 cases. If I set the event handler, I get an exception that the assembly (it's an management console (mmc.exe) SnapIn. could not be found/loaded. ExecuteAssembly does not find an entry point (well, there is none). I have no clue how the type is named. How to load by interface? Similar to 3. How to get the name of an assembly? Same error as in 1. I think the problem could be the managment console somehow or I have just no clue what I'm doing wrong. Any help is appreciated. UPDATE 1 I have now tried using the posted proxy-solution. AppDomain domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain("TempDomain");
InstanceProxy proxy = domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(Assembly.GetAssembly(
    typeof(InstanceProxy)).FullName, typeof(InstanceProxy).ToString()) as InstanceProxy;
if (proxy != null)
{
    proxy.LoadAssembly(path);
}
AppDomain.Unload(domain);

public class InstanceProxy : MarshalByRefObject
{
    public void LoadAssembly(string path)
    {
        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += CurrentDomain_AssemblyResolve;
        Assembly asm = Assembly.LoadFrom(path);
        Type[] types = asm.GetExportedTypes();
        // ...see above...
    }
}
 This does not work either. When trying to create the proxy object, I get an exception: Could not load file or assembly 'MyProject.SnapIn, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. The file in the error message is the on loaded into mmc (the SnapIn). Any idea how to fix this error? AppDomain.AssemblyResolve is not called (neither in the old or new domain). UPDATE 2 I have now tried the solution with the AppDomainSetup. Now, the exception has changed to: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:/Development/MyProject/bin/SnapIn/MyProject.SnapIn.DLL' or one of its dependencies. The given assembly name or codebase was invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131047) Any idea?

 It works in general, but I encounter a severe problem. By using the a VirtualizingStackPanel as the panel in the list view, only the visible ListViewItem are getting created. If I use "Ctrl+A" to select all items, or by using shortcut combination such "Shift+Ctrl+End" on the first item, all items get selected, but for the non visible items, the ViewModel does not get its IsSelected set to true. That is logical, because if the ListViewItem are not created, the binding can't work. Anybody experienced the same issue, and found a solution (apart from not using a VirtualizingStackPanel)?

I managed to get the action done for logout but for session timeout, I can't get it working. In web.xml I only have the ContextLoaderListener specified ( can this be the issue? ) and of course the DelegatingFilterProxy. I use the auto config like this.     <security:http auto-config="false" use-expressions="false">

 The logout handler is called when user clicks logout, which will make some calls to a database. But how do I handle the session timeout ??? One way to handle it would be to inject the username into the session when user logs in and then use an ordinary httpsessionlistener and do the same thing on session timeout. Is there a similar way with spring security, so that when spring discovers that the session is to timeout, I can hook in there, access the Authentication and get the UserDetails from there and do the clean up.

@TITLE:The easiest way to play an audio RTMP stream in Android
@CONTENT:I found some Android RTMP libraries (like this : http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/). The problem is that there is no accurate documentation on how we can use it. In my case, I have a simple RTMP live audio stream (ex: rtmp://myserver/myapp/myliveaudio). What is the easiest way to read it in my Android app? Please, I don't want links: I need some pieces of code or some accurate step-by-step explanation. Thank you very much.

@TITLE:How do I pass large numpy arrays between python subprocesses without saving to disk?
@CONTENT:Is there a good way to pass a large chunk of data between two python subprocesses without using the disk? Here's a cartoon example of what I'm hoping to accomplish: import sys, subprocess, numpy

cmdString = """

        data = numpy.zeros(1000000, dtype=numpy.uint8)
        data.dump('data.pkl')
        sys.stdout.write('data.pkl' + '\\n')
        sys.stdout.flush()"""

proc = subprocess.Popen( #python vs. pythonw on Windows?
    [sys.executable, '-c %s'%cmdString],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

for i in range(3):

    print proc.stdout.readline().rstrip()
    a = numpy.load('data.pkl')
    print a.shape

proc.stdin.write('done\n')
 This creates a subprocess which generates a numpy array and saves the array to disk. The parent process then loads the array from disk. It works! The problem is, our hardware can generate data 10x faster than the disk can read/write. Is there a way to transfer data from one python process to another purely in-memory, maybe even without making a copy of the data? Can I do something like passing-by-reference? My first attempt at transferring data purely in-memory is pretty lousy: import sys, subprocess, numpy

cmdString = """
import sys, numpy

done = False
while not done:
    cmd = raw_input()
    if cmd == 'done':
        done = True
    elif cmd == 'data':
        ##Fake data. In real life, get data from hardware.
        data = numpy.zeros(1000000, dtype=numpy.uint8)
        ##Note that this is NFG if there's a '10' in the array:
        sys.stdout.write(data.tostring() + '\\n')
        sys.stdout.flush()"""

    [sys.executable, '-c %s'%cmdString],

 This is extremely slow (much slower than saving to disk) and very, very fragile. There's got to be a better way! I'm not married to the 'subprocess' module, as long as the data-taking process doesn't block the parent application. I briefly tried 'multiprocessing', but without success so far. Background: We have a piece of hardware that generates up to ~2 GB/s of data in a series of ctypes buffers. The python code to handle these buffers has its hands full just dealing with the flood of information. I want to coordinate this flow of information with several other pieces of hardware running simultaneously in a 'master' program, without the subprocesses blocking each other. My current approach is to boil the data down a little bit in the subprocess before saving to disk, but it'd be nice to pass the full monty to the 'master' process.

@CONTENT:So here is the deal: I'm trying to use socket.io in an express project. After Express Js 4 was lauched, i've updated my express-genrator and now the app initial functions goes into ./bin/www file, including those vars (www file contents: http://jsfiddle.net/avMa5/ ) var server = app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {..}
 (check it by npm install -g express-generator and then express myApp that being said, let's remember how socket.io docs ask us to fire it: var app = require('express').createServer();
var io = require('socket.io')(app);
 Ok but i can't do it inside app.js, like recommended. This should be done in ./bin/www in order to work. in ./bin/www this is what i can do to get it working: var io = require('socket.io')(server)
 Ok this works, but i can't use the io var anywhere else, and i really don't want to put my socket.io functions on www file. I guess this is just basic sintax, but i can't get this to work, not even using module.exports = server or server.exports = server nor module.exports.io = app(io) on www file So the question is: how can i use socket.io havin this /bin/www file as starting point of my app?
@CODE:./bin/www var server = app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {..} npm install -g express-generator express myApp var app = require('express').createServer();

@CONTENT:I am working on a web app which has a width of 640px. In the document head I set   <meta name="viewport" content = "width=640, user-scalable=no" />
 so the content is nicely displayed and stretched horizontally. This works perfectly on iOS but in Android the browser opens the website zoomed in so the user has to double click to zoom out and the entire page. When I change the viewport setting to leave out the user-scalable tag like this: <meta name="viewport" content="width=640" />
 the Android browser adjusts nicely to the 640px - so it works. The problem however now is, that users can zoom in and out on Android and iOS since the user-scalable tag is not set. How can I forbid the scaling and at the same time set the viewport width to 640px on Android?

@TITLE:How do a send an HTTPS request through a proxy in Java?
@CONTENT:I am trying to send a request to a server using the HttpsUrlConnection class. The server has certificate issues, so I set up a TrustManager that trusts everything, as well as a hostname verifier that is equally lenient. This manager works just fine when I make my request directly, but it doesn't seem to be used at all when I send the request through a proxy. I set my proxy settings like this: Properties systemProperties = System.getProperties();
systemProperties.setProperty( "http.proxyHost", "proxyserver" );
systemProperties.setProperty( "http.proxyPort", "8080" );
systemProperties.setProperty( "https.proxyHost", "proxyserver" );
systemProperties.setProperty( "https.proxyPort", "8080" );
 The TrustManager for the default SSLSocketFactory is set up like this: SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance( "SSL" );

// set up a TrustManager that trusts everything
sslContext.init( null, new TrustManager[]
    {
        new X509TrustManager()
        {
            public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers()
            {
                return null;
            }

            public void checkClientTrusted( X509Certificate[] certs, String authType )
            {
                // everything is trusted
            }

            public void checkServerTrusted( X509Certificate[] certs, String authType )
            {
                // everything is trusted
            }
        }
    }, new SecureRandom() );

// this doesn't seem to apply to connections through a proxy
HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory( sslContext.getSocketFactory() );

// setup a hostname verifier that verifies everything
HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier( new HostnameVerifier()
{
    public boolean verify( String arg0, SSLSession arg1 )
    {
        return true;
    }
} );
 If I run the following code, I end up with an SSLHandshakException ("Remote host closed connection during handshake"): URL url = new URL( "https://someurl" );

HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
connection.setDoOutput( true );

connection.setRequestMethod( "POST" );
connection.setRequestProperty( "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" );
connection.setRequestProperty( "Content-Length", "0" );

connection.connect();
 I assume I am missing some kind of setting having to do with using a proxy when dealing with SSL. If I don't use a proxy, my checkServerTrusted method gets called; this is what I need to happen when I am going through the proxy as well. I don't usually deal with Java and I don't have much experience with HTTP/web stuff. I believe I have provided all the detail necessary to understand what I am trying to do. If this isn't the case, let me know. Update: After reading the article suggested by ZZ Coder, I made the following changes to the connection code: HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
connection.setSSLSocketFactory( new SSLTunnelSocketFactory( proxyHost, proxyPort ) );

connection.setDoOutput( true );
connection.setRequestMethod( "POST" );
connection.setRequestProperty( "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" );
connection.setRequestProperty( "Content-Length", "0" );

connection.connect();
 The result (SSLHandshakeException) is the same. When I set the SLLSocketFactory here to the SSLTunnelSocketFactory (the class explained in the article), the stuff I did with the TrustManager and the SSLContext is overridden. Don't I still need that? Another Update: I modified the SSLTunnelSocketFactory class to use the SSLSocketFactory that uses my TrustManager that trusts everything. It doesn't appear that this has made any difference. This is the createSocket method of SSLTunnelSocketFactory: public Socket createSocket( Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose )
    throws IOException, UnknownHostException
{
    Socket tunnel = new Socket( tunnelHost, tunnelPort );

    doTunnelHandshake( tunnel, host, port );

    SSLSocket result = (SSLSocket)dfactory.createSocket(
        tunnel, host, port, autoClose );

    result.addHandshakeCompletedListener(
        new HandshakeCompletedListener()
        {
            public void handshakeCompleted( HandshakeCompletedEvent event )
            {
                System.out.println( "Handshake finished!" );
                System.out.println(
                    "\t CipherSuite:" + event.getCipherSuite() );
                System.out.println(
                    "\t SessionId " + event.getSession() );
                System.out.println(
                    "\t PeerHost " + event.getSession().getPeerHost() );
            }
        } );

    result.startHandshake();

    return result;
}
 When my code calls connection.connect, this method is called, and the call to doTunnelHandshake is successful. The next line of code uses my SSLSocketFactory to create an SSLSocket; the toString value of result after this call is: "1d49247[SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL: Socket[addr=/proxyHost,port=proxyPort,localport=24372]]". This is meaningless to me, but it might be the reason things break down after this. When result.startHandshake() is called, the same createSocket method is called again from, according to the call stack, HttpsClient.afterConnect, with the same arguments, except Socket s is null, and when it comes around to result.startHandshake() again, the result is the same SSLHandshakeException. Am I still missing an important piece to this increasingly complicated puzzle? This is the stack trace:

@CONTENT:I am using c++ , I want to do alpha blend using the following code. #define CLAMPTOBYTE(color) if((color) & (~255)) {color = (BYTE)((-(color)) >> 31);}else{color = (BYTE)(color);}
#define GET_BYTE(accessPixel, x, y, scanline, bpp)\
((BYTE*)((accessPixel) + (y) * (scanline) + (x) * (bpp))) 

	for (int y = top ; y < bottom; ++y)
	{
		BYTE* resultByte = GET_BYTE(resultBits, left, y, stride, bytepp);
		BYTE* srcByte = GET_BYTE(srcBits, left, y, stride, bytepp);
		BYTE* srcByteTop = GET_BYTE(srcBitsTop, left, y, stride, bytepp);
		BYTE* maskCurrent = GET_GREY(maskSrc, left, y, width);
		int alpha = 0;
		int red = 0;
		int green = 0;
		int blue = 0;
		for (int x = left; x < right; ++x)
		{
			alpha = *maskCurrent;
			red = (srcByteTop[R] * alpha + srcByte[R] * (255 - alpha)) / 255;
			green = (srcByteTop[G] * alpha + srcByte[G] * (255 - alpha)) / 255;
			blue = (srcByteTop[B] * alpha + srcByte[B] * (255 - alpha)) / 255;
			CLAMPTOBYTE(red);
			CLAMPTOBYTE(green);
			CLAMPTOBYTE(blue);
			resultByte[R] = red;
			resultByte[G] = green;
			resultByte[B] = blue;
			srcByte += bytepp;
			srcByteTop += bytepp;
			resultByte += bytepp;
			++maskCurrent;
		}
	}
 however I find it is still slow, it takes about 40 - 60 ms when compose two 600 * 600 image. Is there any method to improve the speed to less then 16ms? Can any body help me to speed this code? Many thanks!

@TITLE:iOS 6 js events function not called if has setTimeout in it
@CONTENT:I noticed this strange behaviour with the latest iOS (iOS 6). If calling a function for any touch event which has a setTimeout inside, the part inside the setTimeout is never triggered. This happens only when there is a "system animation" such as scroll and zoom-in/out. For example: http://jsfiddle.net/p4SdL/2/ (I used jquery just for testing but the same happens with pure js) Open that page with safari on any iOS 6 device and zoom in or out. The alert will never be called. If tested on any iOS 5 device this will work just fine! It seems that during these animations the setTimeout or setInterval are reset by the OS. Is this the intended behaviour or a bug? Thanks

@CONTENT:I have created a UIMenuController and have set it a custom menu item like so: UIMenuController *menuController = [UIMenuController sharedMenuController];
UIMenuItem *item1 = [[UIMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Do This" action:@selector(item1)];
[menuController setMenuItems:[NSArray arrayWithObject:item1]];

    BOOL answer = NO;

    if (action == @selector(item1))
        answer = YES;

    return answer;
}
 The problem is it still shows other## Heading ## items, such as "Select", "Select All" and "Paste". This may have something to do with this being displayed in a UITextView. But how do I stop if from displaying all other items?

I've spent hours searching for this, but no luck... It seems like this should be easily possible, but I can't find it. Preferably this would be by inflating a View from XML, but at this point anything that would just work would be nice. Thanks.

 However if I want to do something like this: foreach ($database->query("SELECT * FROM widgets WHERE something='something else'") as $results)

 Obviously the 'something else' will be dynamic.

@TITLE:Slick2D and JBox2D. How to draw
@CONTENT:Before asking this i did A LOT of searching on the net. I just can't do it. It's a little hard for me to understand. So how do i draw the images at the right screen positions coresponding to bodies in world position? Thanx. If anyone else finds himslef in front of the same obstacle i posted a HOW TO, thanx to normalocity's good explanation. You can find it here: http://romeo.akademx.ro/2012/04/06/slick-and-box2d/ This is the render function: public void render(GameContainer container, StateBasedGame game, Graphics g)
        throws SlickException {
    g.setBackground(Color.white);

    g.pushTransform();
    g.translate(worldToScreen(body.getPosition()).x, worldToScreen(body.getPosition()).y);
    g.rotate(15, 15, (float) Math.toDegrees(body.getAngle()));
    part.draw();
    g.popTransform();

    g.drawString("Count: " + cont, 5, 40);
    //world.drawDebugData();
}
 And these are the function i use to transform world-screen coordinations: public Vec2 screenToWorld(Vec2 screenV) {
    return new Vec2((screenV.x - offset.x) / scaleFactor, yFlip
            * (screenV.y - offset.y) / scaleFactor);
}

public Vec2 worldToScreen(Vec2 worldV) {
    return new Vec2(worldV.x * scaleFactor + offset.x, yFlip * worldV.y
            * scaleFactor + offset.y);
}
 I also happen to use the SlickDebugDraw found at this link: http://slick.javaunlimited.net/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=3610&sid=69614ac53aaf5724b808b75173e8e48e But his DebugDraw draws a completely another thing then my render function. I'm a bit confused.
@CODE:public void render(GameContainer container, StateBasedGame game, Graphics g)
        throws SlickException {
    g.setBackground(Color.white);

    g.pushTransform();
    g.translate(worldToScreen(body.getPosition()).x, worldToScreen(body.getPosition()).y);
    g.rotate(15, 15, (float) Math.toDegrees(body.getAngle()));
    part.draw();
    g.popTransform();

    g.drawString("Count: " + cont, 5, 40);
    //world.drawDebugData();
} public Vec2 screenToWorld(Vec2 screenV) {
    return new Vec2((screenV.x - offset.x) / scaleFactor, yFlip
            * (screenV.y - offset.y) / scaleFactor);
}

public Vec2 worldToScreen(Vec2 worldV) {

@TITLE:Multi threading C# application with SQL Server database calls
@CONTENT:I have a SQL Server database with 500,000 records in table main. There are also three other tables called child1, child2, and child3. The many to many relationships between child1, child2, child3, and main are implemented via the three relationship tables: main_child1_relationship, main_child2_relationship, and main_child3_relationship. I need to read the records in main, update main, and also insert into the relationship tables new rows as well as insert new records in the child tables. The records in the child tables have uniqueness constraints, so the pseudo-code for the actual calculation (CalculateDetails) would be something like: for each record in main
{
   find its child1 like qualities
   for each one of its child1 qualities
   {
      find the record in child1 that matches that quality
      if found
      {
          add a record to main_child1_relationship to connect the two records
      }
      else
      {
          create a new record in child1 for the quality mentioned
          add a record to main_child1_relationship to connect the two records
      }
   }
   ...repeat the above for child2
   ...repeat the above for child3 
}
 This works fine as a single threaded app. But it is too slow. The processing in C# is pretty heavy duty and takes too long. I want to turn this into a multi-threaded app. What is the best way to do this? We are using Linq to Sql. So far my approach has been to create a new DataContext object for each batch of records from main and use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem to process it. However these batches are stepping on each other's toes because one thread adds a record and then the next thread tries to add the same one and ... I am getting all kinds of interesting SQL Server dead locks. Here is the code:     int skip = 0;
    List<int> thisBatch;
    Queue<List<int>> allBatches = new Queue<List<int>>();
    do
    {
        thisBatch = allIds
                .Skip(skip)
                .Take(numberOfRecordsToPullFromDBAtATime).ToList();
        allBatches.Enqueue(thisBatch);
        skip += numberOfRecordsToPullFromDBAtATime;

    } while (thisBatch.Count() > 0);

    while (allBatches.Count() > 0)
    {
        RRDataContext rrdc = new RRDataContext();

        var currentBatch = allBatches.Dequeue();
        lock (locker)  
        {
            runningTasks++;
        }
        System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(x =>
                    ProcessBatch(currentBatch, rrdc));

        lock (locker) 
        {
            while (runningTasks > MAX_NUMBER_OF_THREADS)
            {
                 Monitor.Wait(locker);
                 UpdateGUI();
            }
        }
    }
 And here is ProcessBatch:     private static void ProcessBatch( 
        List<int> currentBatch, RRDataContext rrdc)
    {
        var topRecords = GetTopRecords(rrdc, currentBatch);
        CalculateDetails(rrdc, topRecords);
        rrdc.Dispose();

        lock (locker)
        {
            runningTasks--;
            Monitor.Pulse(locker);
        };
    }
 And     private static List<Record> GetTopRecords(RecipeRelationshipsDataContext rrdc, 
                                              List<int> thisBatch)
    {
        List<Record> topRecords;

        topRecords = rrdc.Records
                    .Where(x => thisBatch.Contains(x.Id))
                    .OrderBy(x => x.OrderByMe).ToList();
        return topRecords;
    }
 CalculateDetails is best explained by the pseudo-code at the top. I think there must be a better way to do this. Please help. Many thanks!

@TITLE:How to get the custom overlay for UIImagePicker camera to be full screen in iOS 7?
@CONTENT:I am interested in using a custom overlay for the UIImagePickerController for camera controls that take the entire screen, very similar to what the default Camera app does when switched to the video function. I have referenced several questions here on SO on this topic, particularly this one, as well as the Apple example on how to use a custom overlay for the UIImagePickerController, but none of them have been able to produce a successful, full-screen result with iOS 7. So far, this is what the camera UI looks like with the custom overlay (without any buttons): Note that there is a black bar in the bottom of the screen. I noticed that I could get the black bar removed if I change the cameraAspectRatio to 1, but this distorts the camera zoom as it then has a very zoomed in view. Is there a way to have full screen without either distorting the zoom too much (I understand that a small bit is necessary), and also remove the black bar? Here is my code that configures the custom overlay: {
        self.imagePickerController.showsCameraControls = NO;

        [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"overlayView" owner:self options:nil];
        self.overlayView.frame = self.imagePickerController.cameraOverlayView.frame;
        self.imagePickerController.cameraOverlayView = self.overlayView;
        self.overlayView = nil;

        // Device's screen size (ignoring rotation intentionally):
        CGSize screenSize = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size;


        float cameraAspectRatio = 4.0 / 3.0; //! Note: 4.0 and 4.0 works
        float imageWidth = floorf(screenSize.width * cameraAspectRatio);
        float scale = ceilf((screenSize.height / imageWidth) * 10.0) / 10.0;

        self.imagePickerController.cameraViewTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(scale, scale);

    }
 Update: An additional issue that I noticed is, the picture that is shown in camera preview is always smaller and has less details than the picture that is saved when the method [self.imagePickerController takePicture]. To illustrate: This is what the keyboard looks like in the camera preview with the black bar below (sorry its a bit shaky): However, note that the actual captured image in the preview panel has a lot more details as shown here, especially towards the top, as well as both left and right. My question is, how would be able to set my camera preview so that what the user sees in preview is exactly the image that it will capture and could be shown to them afterwards? Thanks! Update 2 Here is the entire code in viewDidLoad that sets up the camera controls. - (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    //Appearance configuration
    self.navigationItem.hidesBackButton = YES;

    //UIImagePickerController initialization and setup

    } else {

    }
    self.imagePickerController.mediaTypes = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects: (NSString *) kUTTypeImage, nil];

@TITLE:Symfony2 create own encoder for storing password
@CONTENT:I'm new to Symfony2 and I have maybe a simple question about encoding my user passwords in my DB. I'd like to encode and store in DB my users' password that way: encoded_password = salt . sha1 ( salt . raw_password )
 I've found various encoders (sha1, sha512, plaintext), I saw that with plaintext I have in my DB raw_password{salt} but I'm still not comfortable with signin/login/getSalt() method in Symfony2. If you could give me a lift on that (please, assume I do not want to use an existing bundle for UserManagement, I'd like to make my own) it would be AWESOME! Thanks EDIT: I could do that in my signinAction(): $salt = substr(md5(time()),0,10);
$pwd = $encoder->encodePassword($user->getPassword(), $salt);
$user->setPassword($salt.$pwd);
 I could do that in my getSalt(): return substr($this->password,0,10);
 But I currently have only that in my loginAction(): (see here: http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html) // src/Acme/SecurityBundle/Controller/Main;
namespace Acme\SecurityBundle\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\SecurityContext;

    {

        $session = $request->getSession();

        // get the login error if there is one
        if ($request->attributes->has(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR)) {
            $error = $request->attributes->get(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR);
        } else {
            $error = $session->get(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR);
        }

        return $this->render('AcmeSecurityBundle:Security:login.html.twig', array(

    }
}
 How can I tell Symfony2 to check the password during the login action the way I need? (curently doing encode(password,salt) and not salt.encode(password,salt)
@CODE:encoded_password = salt . sha1 ( salt . raw_password ) $salt = substr(md5(time()),0,10);
$pwd = $encoder->encodePassword($user->getPassword(), $salt);

@TITLE:Getting Zend_Navigation menu to work with jQuery's Fisheye
@CONTENT:I'm using Zend_Navigation (sweet addition to the framework, btw) to build my menu, after which it should be rendered in the page (self-evidently). I first set the container somewhere in the controller: // $pages is the array containing all page information
$nav = new Zend_Navigation($pages);
$this->view->navigation($nav);
 Then, in the layout, it is rendered like this: echo $this->navigation()->menu();
 which works perfectly. Now: I want the menu to be rendered a little differently. The page I'm building uses the jQuery Fisheye-plugin to build a Mac-like Dock-menu. However, this plugin needs a specific markup... Actually, it takes a list of <a> elements containing both an <img> (for the icon) and a <span> (for the tooltip). The standard Menu view helper renders everything inside an unordered list (logically), with the 'label' parameter as the link text. It seems that content passed to the 'label' parameter is escaped before rendering, so inserting the html there won't do me any good. Additionally, the Fisheye usually doesn't seem to take its items contained in a <li> tag, with the entire thing wrapped in <ul></ul>, but just a one-level list of <a> elements. I was thinking about writing a custom view helper for the dock, which would be able to take care of inserting the <img> and the <span>, but I'm having a very hard time getting a custom view helper attached to the Navigation class. I just can't figure out where to place it and in what way, even though all my other custom classes (models and such) are sweetly taken care of by the autoloader. Any ideas on this? Then again, even if I can get this view helper to work, I'm still left with the HTML unordered list - I know I can lose that one too using the custom view helper, but I've always been a fan of containing main navigation menus inside a list, for the sake of semantics. If anyone can help me out a little, I'd greatly appreciate it. If the Fisheye just isn't meant to work with <ul>'s, that'd be too bad... would there be a good reason for losing Zend_Navigation altogether in this case?
@CODE:// $pages is the array containing all page information
$nav = new Zend_Navigation($pages);

 Do i really have to copy all constructors from Foo into Bar and Bah? And then if i change a constructor signature in Foo, do i have to update it in Bar and Bah? Is there no way to inherit constructors? Is there no way to encourage code reuse?
@CODE:public class Foo
{
   ...
   public Foo() {...}
   public Foo(int i) {...}
   ...
   public virtual void SomethingElse() {...}
   ...
} public class Bar : Foo

   public override void SomethingElse() {...}

@CONTENT:I'm using the Obsolete attribute (as just suggested by fellow programmers) to show a warning if a certain method is used. Is there a way to suppress the warning similar to CodeAnalysis' SuppressMessage at points where the use is justified? Thank you! EDIT This is for [Obsolete("Some message")] as I need to include some details about the warning. However, #pragma warning disable 612 doesn't work anymore once I add the message to the naked [Obsolete] attribute... EDIT 2 Found the right warning number - It is 618 if you have a message following the obsolete attribute. So to do what I want to do: #pragma warning disable 618 and then after the call #pragma warning restore 618 Thanks to Jared Par and Jon Skeet for pointing me in the right direction!

@CONTENT:In multiple courses, books, and jobs, I have seen text fields defined as VARCHAR(255) as kind of the default for "shortish" text. Is there any good reason that a length of 255 is chosen so often, other than being a nice round number? Is it a holdout from some time in the past when there was a good reason (whether or not it applies today)? I realize, of course, that a tighter limit would be more ideal, if you somehow know the maximum length of the string. But if you are using VARCHAR(255) that probably indicates that you don't know the max length, only that it is a "shortish" string. Note: I found this question (varchar(255) v tinyblob v tinytext), which says that VARCHAR(n) requires n+1 bytes of storage for n<=255, n+2 bytes of storage for n>255. Is this the only reason? That seems kind of arbitrary, since you would only be saving two bytes compared to VARCHAR(256), and you could just as easily save another two bytes by declaring it VARCHAR(253).

@TITLE:When Clearing an ObservableCollection, There are No Items in e.OldItems
@CONTENT:I have something here that is really catching me off guard. I have an ObservableCollection of T that is filled with items. I also have an event handler attached to the CollectionChanged event. When you Clear the collection it causes an CollectionChanged event with e.Action set to NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Reset. Ok, that's normal. But what is weird is that neither e.OldItems or e.NewItems has anything in it. I would expect e.OldItems to be filled with all items that were removed from the collection. Has anyone else seen this? And if so, how have they gotten around it? Some background: I am using the CollectionChanged event to attach and detach from another event and thus if I don't get any items in e.OldItems ... I won't be able to detach from that event. CLARIFICATION: I do know that the documentation doesn't outright state that it has to behave this way. But for every other action, it is notifying me of what it has done. So, my assumption is that it would tell me ... in the case of Clear/Reset as well. Below is the sample code if you wish to reproduce it yourself. First off the xaml: <Window

socket.on('connect', function () { console.log("socket connected"); });
socket.emit('private message', { user: 'me', msg: 'whazzzup?' });

@TITLE:Why does the lock object have to be static?
@CONTENT:It is very common to use a private static readonly object for locking in multi threading. I understand that private reduces the entry points to the locking object by tightening the encapsulation and therefore access to the most essential. But why static? private static readonly object Locker = new object();
 At the end the field is only used within my class only, and I could also just use this instead: private readonly object Locker = new object();
 Any comments? UPDATE: As an example I have pasted this code (just an example). I could use static or non-static locker on this and both would work fine. Considering the answer below I should be rather defining my locker like this? (Sorry I have an interview next week and need to know every detail :) private readonly object Locker = new object();

@LINK:/questions/4290878/why-shouldnt-java-enum-literals-be-able-to-have-generic-type-parameters
@TITLE:Why shouldn't Java enum literals be able to have generic type parameters?
@CONTENT:Java enums are great. So are generics. Of course we all know the limitations of the latter because of type erasure. But one thing I don't understand. Why can't I create an enum like this: public enum MyEnum<T> {
    LITERAL1<String>,
    LITERAL2<Integer>,
    LITERAL3<Object>;
}
 This generic type parameter <T>, in turn could then be useful in various places. Imagine a generic type parameter to a method: public <T> T getValue(MyEnum<T> param);
 Or even in the enum class itself: public T convert(Object o);
 More concrete example #1 Since the a above example seems too abstract for some, here's a more real-life example of why I want to do this. In this example I want to use Enums, because then I can enumerate a finite set of property keys Generics, because then I can have method-level type-safety for storing properties public interface MyProperties {
     public <T> void put(MyEnum<T> key, T value);
     public <T> T get(MyEnum<T> key);
}
 More concrete example #2 I have an enumeration of data types: public interface DataType<T> {}

public enum SQLDataType<T> implements DataType<T> {
    TINYINT<Byte>,
    SMALLINT<Short>,
    INT<Integer>,
    BIGINT<Long>,
    CLOB<String>,
    VARCHAR<String>,
    ...

 Each enum literal would obviously have additional properties based on the generic type <T>, while at the same time, being an enum (immutable, singleton, enumerable, etc. etc.) Question: Did no one think of this? Is this a compiler-related limitation? Considering the fact, that the keyword "enum" is implemented as syntactic sugar, representing generated code to the JVM, I don't understand this limitation. Who can explain this to me? Before you answer, consider this: I know generic types are erased :-) I know there are workarounds using Class objects. They're workarounds. Generic types result in compiler-generated type casts whereever applicable (e.g. when calling the convert() method The generic type <T> would be on the enum. Hence it is bound by each of the enum's literals. Hence the compiler would know, which type to apply when writing something like String string = LITERAL1.convert(myObject); Integer integer = LITERAL2.convert(myObject); The same applies to the generic type parameter in the T getvalue() method. The compiler can apply type casting when calling String string = someClass.getValue(LITERAL1)
@CODE:public enum MyEnum<T> {
    LITERAL1<String>,
    LITERAL2<Integer>,
    LITERAL3<Object>;
} public <T> T getValue(MyEnum<T> param); public T convert(Object o); public interface MyProperties {
     public <T> void put(MyEnum<T> key, T value);
     public <T> T get(MyEnum<T> key);
} public interface DataType<T> {}

public enum SQLDataType<T> implements DataType<T> {
    TINYINT<Byte>,
    SMALLINT<Short>,
    INT<Integer>,
    BIGINT<Long>,
    CLOB<String>,
    VARCHAR<String>,
    ...
} <T> String string = LITERAL1.convert(myObject); Integer integer = LITERAL2.convert(myObject); T getvalue() String string = someClass.getValue(LITERAL1) enum

@CONTENT:I want to export some SQL Server 2005 data to CSV format (comma-separated with quotes). I can think of a lot of complicated ways to do it, but I want to do it the right way. I've looked at bcp, but I can't figure out how to put the quotes around the fields (except concatenating them to the field values, which is ugly). I guess I could do it with sqlcmd and -o, but that seems ugly for the same reason. Is there a bcp way to do it? Is there a reasonable sqlcmd way to do it?

I also want it to change its style in a similar way if it is touched in a mobile browser. The seemingly-obvious thing to me was to use the CSS :active pseudo-class, but that didn't work.

@CONTENT:The application I want to build using MS Visual C# Express (I'm willing to upgrade to Standard if that becomes required) that needs a database. I was all psyched about the SQL Server Compact - because I don't want the folks who would be installing my application on their computers to have to install the whole of SQL Server or something like that. I want this to be as easy as possible for the end user to install. So I was all psyched until it seems that there are limitations to what I can do with the columns in my tables. I created a new database, created a table and when I went to create columns it seems that there isn't a "text" datatype - just something called "ntext" that seems to be limited to 255 characters. "int" seems to be limited to 4 (I wanted 11). And there doesn't seem to be an "auto_increment" feature. Are these the real limitations I would have to live with? (Or is it because I'm using "Express" and not "Standard"). If these are the real limitations, what are my other database options that meet my requirements? (easy installation for user being the biggie - I'm assuming that my end user is just an average user of computers and if it's complicated would get frustrated with my application) -Adeena PS: I also want my database data to be encrypted to the end user. I don't want them to be able to access the database tables directly. PPS.

@CONTENT:I have a bunch of ZIP files that are in desperate need of some hierarchical reorganization and extraction. What I can do, currently, is create the directory structure and move the zip files to the proper location. The mystic cheese that I am missing is the part that extracts the files from the ZIP archive. I have seen the MSDN articles on the ZipArchive class and understand them reasonable well. I have also seen the VBScript ways to extract. This is not a complex class so extracting stuff should be pretty simple. In fact, it works "mostly".

    foreach (PackageRelationship relation in packageParts)
    {
       //Do Stuff but never gets here since packageParts is empty.
    }
 }
 The problem seems to be somewhere in the GetParts (or Get*Anything* for that matter). It seems that the package, while open, is empty. Digging deeper the debugger shows that the private member _zipArchive shows that it actually has parts. Parts with the right names and everything. Why won't the GetParts function retrieve them? I'ver tried casting the open to a ZipArchive and that didn't help. Grrr.

@LINK:/questions/1836364/bad-form-for-junit-test-to-throw-exception
@TITLE:Bad form for JUnit test to throw exception?
@CONTENT:I'm pretty new to JUnit, and I don't really know what best practices are for exceptions and exception handling. For example, let's say I'm writing tests for an IPAddress class. It has a constructor IPAddress(String addr) that will throw an InvalidIPAddressException if addr is null. As far as I can tell from googling around, the test for the null parameter will look like this. @Test
public void testNullParameter()
{
	try
	{
		IPAddress addr = new IPAddress(null);
		assertTrue(addr.getOctets() == null);
	}
	catch(InvalidIPAddressException e)
	{
		return;
	}

	fail("InvalidIPAddressException not thrown.");
}
 In this case, try/catch makes sense because I know the exception is coming. But now if I want to write testValidIPAddress(), there's a couple of ways to do it: Way #1: @Test
public void testValidIPAddress() throws InvalidIPAddressException
{
	IPAddress addr = new IPAddress("127.0.0.1");
	byte[] octets = addr.getOctets();

	assertTrue(octets[0] == 127);
	assertTrue(octets[1] == 0);
	assertTrue(octets[2] == 0);
	assertTrue(octets[3] == 1);
}
 Way #2: @Test
public void testValidIPAddress()
{
	try
	{
		IPAddress addr = new IPAddress("127.0.0.1");
		byte[] octets = addr.getOctets();

		assertTrue(octets[0] == 127);
		assertTrue(octets[1] == 0);
		assertTrue(octets[2] == 0);
		assertTrue(octets[3] == 1);
	}
	catch (InvalidIPAddressException e)
	{
		fail("InvalidIPAddressException: " + e.getMessage());
	}
}
 Is is standard practice to throw unexpected exceptions to JUnit or just deal with them yourself? Thanks for the help.

@LINK:/questions/4880168/why-cant-java-constructors-be-synchronized
@TITLE:Why can't Java constructors be synchronized?
@CONTENT:According to the Java Language Specification, constructors cannot be marked synchronized because other threads cannot see the object being created until the thread creating it has finished it. This seems a bit odd, because I can indeed have another thread view the object while it's being constructed: public class Test {
    public Test() {
       final Test me = this;
       new Thread() {
           @Override
           public void run() {
               // ... Reference 'me,' the object being constructed
           }
       }.start();
    }
}
 I know that this is a pretty contrived example, but it seems in theory that someone could come up with a more realistic case where marking the constructor synchronized would be legitimate in order to prevent races with threads like this one. My question is this: is there a reason that Java would specifically disallow the synchronized modifier on a constructor? Perhaps my above example is flawed, or perhaps there really is no reason and it's an arbitrary design decision. In either case, I'm really curious and would love to know the answer.
@CODE:public class Test {
    public Test() {
       final Test me = this;
       new Thread() {
           @Override
           public void run() {
               // ... Reference 'me,' the object being constructed
           }
       }.start();
    }
} instances.add(this);

 However, I'm not convinced that this solution doesn't contain any caveats I haven't thought of (sorry for the triple negation), especially because reassigning the magical __class__ just doesn't feel right. Even if this works, I can't help the feeling there should be a more pythonic way of doing this. Is there? Edit: Thanks everyone for your answers. Here is what I get from them: Although the idea of reclassing an instance by assigning to __class__ is not a widely used idiom, most answers (4 out of 6 at the time of writing) consider it a valid approach. One anwswer (by ojrac) says that it's "pretty weird at first glance," with which I agree (it was the reason for asking the question). Only one answer (by Jason Baker; with two positive comments & votes) actively discouraged me from doing this, however doing so based on the example use case moreso than on the technique in general. None of the answers, whether positive or not, finds an actual technical problem in this method. A small exception is jls who mentions to beware of old-style classes, which is likely true, and C extensions. I suppose that new-style-class-aware C extensions should be as fine with this method as Python itself (presuming the latter is true), although if you disagree, keep the answers coming. As to the question of how pythonic this is, there were a few positive answers, but no real reasons given. Looking at the Zen (import this), I guess the most important rule in this case is "Explicit is better than implicit." I'm not sure, though, whether that rule speaks for or against reclassing this way. Using {has,get,set}attr seems more explicit, as we are explicitly making our changes to the object instead of using magic. Using __class__ = newclass seems more explicit because we explicitly say "This is now an object of class 'newclass,' expect a different behaviour" instead of silently changing attributes but leaving users of the object believing they are dealing with a regular object of the old class. Summing up: From a technical standpoint, the method seems okay; the pythonicity question remains unanswered with a bias towards "yes." I have accepted Martin Geisler's answer, because the Mercurial plugin example is a quite strong one (and also because it answered a question I even hadn't asked myself yet). However, if there are any arguments on the pythonicity question, I'd still like to hear them. Thanks all so far. P.S. The actual use case is a UI data control object that needs to grow additional functionality at runtime. However, the question is meant to be very general.

@CONTENT:I feel I have a pretty decent understanding of closures, how to use them, and when they can be useful. But what I don't understand is how they actually work behind the scenes in memory. Some example code: public Action Counter()
{
    int count = 0;
    Action counter = () =>
    {
        count++;
    };

    return counter;
}
 Normally, if {count} was not captured by the closure, its lifecycle would be scoped to the Counter() method, and after it completes it would go away with the rest of the stack allocation for Counter(). What happens though when it is closured? Does the whole stack allocation for this call of Counter() stick around? Does it copy {count} to the heap? Does it never actually get allocated on the stack, but recognized by the compiler as being closured and therefore always lives on the heap? For this particular question, I'm primarily interested in how this works in C#, but would not be opposed to comparisons against other languages that support closures.

@TITLE:Selenium WebDriver : Wait for complex page with JavaScript(JS) to load
@CONTENT:I have a web application to test with selenium. There is a lot of JavaScript running on page load. This JavaScript code is not so well written but I can't change anything. So waiting for an element to appear in the DOM with findElement() method is not an option. I want to create a generic function in Java to wait for a page to load, a possible solution would be : run a JavaScript script form WebDriver and store the result of document.body.innerHTML in a string variable body. compare the body variable to the previous version of body. if they are the same then set increment a counter notChangedCount otherwise set notChangedCount to zero. wait for a litte time (50 ms for example). if the page has not changed for some time (500 ms for example) so notChangedCount >= 10 then exit the loop otherwise loop to the first step. Do you think it's a valid solution ?

@LINK:/questions/9489061/understanding-median-of-medians-algorithm
@TITLE:Understanding median of medians algorithm
@CONTENT:Hi I want to understand "median of medians" algorithm on the following example: So we have 45 distinct numbers divided to 9 group with 5 elements. 48 43 38 33 28 23 18 13 8

49 44 39 34 29 24 19 14 9 

50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10

51 46 41 36 31 26 21 16 53

52 47 42 37 32 27 22 17 54
 The first step is sorting every group (in this case they are already sorted) Second step recursively, ?nd the "true" median of the medians (50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10) i.e. the set will be divided into 2 groups: 50 25

45 20 

40 15

35 10

30
 sorting this 2 groups 30 10

35 15 

40 20

45 25

50
 the medians is 40 and 15 (in case the numbers are even we took left median) so the returned value is 15 however "true" median of medians (50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10) is 30, moreover there are 5 elements less then 15 which are much less than 30% of 45 which are mentioned in wikipedia and so T(n) <= T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n) fails. By the way in wikipedia's example I get result of recursion 36 however the true median is 47. So I think in some cases this recursion may not return true median of medians. I want to understand where is my mistake.

@CONTENT:This is the info on Facebook Login button http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/ So it will render a Login button, and a user can click on it to log in on Facebook (a log in window will pop up) But after the user logs in, even though the Like or Share buttons work now, but the Log in button still shows. 1) Is there a way to redirect to a URL after the user successfully logs in? 2) Another way is to dynamically change the Log in button to invisible or better yet, show it as "Logged in as [Peter (username)]" How can (1) and/or (2) be done? (I don't see a callback URL in the Facebook app setting and also the redirection may need to go to different URL from page A or page B on the website) Update: I found some info about <fb:login-button on-login="top.location = '...'; "> but I see some website doing the redirect but there is no on-login='...'

@CONTENT:I've been running into some problems concerning a SqlTransaction I'm using in my code. During my Googling I see many people using a using statement with a SqlTransaction. What is the benefit and/or difference of using this type of statement with a SqlTransaction? using (SqlConnection cn = new SqlConnection())

     using (SqlTransaction tr = cn.BeginTransaction())

cn.Open();
SqlTransaction tr = cn.BeginTransaction();

     cn.Close();

Clear this association before associating this view with <MapViewController: 0x1dd947c0>.'
 This is an old project that I havent touched in months, wonder what could cause such an error?
@CODE:MapViewController *mapView = [[MapViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MapViewController" bundle:nil];
    mapView.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;

@TITLE:SpinWait vs Sleep waiting. Which one to use?
@CONTENT:Is it efficient to SpinWait.SpinUntil(() => myPredicate(), 10000)
 for a timeout of 10000ms or Is it more efficient to use Thread.Sleep polling for the same condition For example something along the lines of the following SleepWait function: public bool SleepWait(int timeOut)
{
    Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch(); 
    stopwatch.Start();
    while (!myPredicate() && stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds < timeOut)
    {
       Thread.Sleep(50)
    }  
    return myPredicate()
}
 I'm concerned that all the yielding of SpinWait may not be a good usage pattern if we are talking about timeouts over 1sec? Is this a valid assumption? Which approach do you prefer and why? Is there another even better approach? Update - Becoming more specific: Is there a way to Make BlockingCollection Pulse a sleeping thread when it reaches bounded capacity? I rather avoid a busy waits alltogether as Marc Gravel suggests.

@CONTENT:SEO-friendly URLs are all the rage these days. But do they actually have a meaningful impact on a page's ranking in Google and other search engines? If so, why? If not, why not? (Note that I would absolutely agree that SEO-friendly URLs are nicer to use for human beings. My question is whether they actually make a difference to the ranking algorithms.) Update: As it turns out, the Google post that endorphine points to here has caused tremendous confusion in the SEO community. For a sampling of the discussion, see here, here, and here. Part of the problem is that the Google post is addressing the worst case where URL rewriting is done poorly and so you'd be better off sticking with a dynamic URL rather than a mangled static "SEO-friendly" URL. There's no question dynamic URLs can be crawled by Google and can achieve high rankings. Maybe it would be easier to reframe the question more concretely: given 2 otherwise equivalent pages, which will rank higher for the search "do seo friendly urls really affect page ranking"? A) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/505793/do-seo-friendly-urls-really-affect-a-pages-ranking or B) http://stackoverflow.com?question=505793 (a fake URL for comparison only)

@TITLE:Decimal vs Double Speed
@CONTENT:I write financial applications where I constantly battle the decision to use a double vs using a decimal. All of my math works on numbers with no more than 5 decimal places and are not larger than ~100,000. I have a feeling that all of these can be represented as doubles anyways without rounding error, but have never been sure. I would go ahead and make the switch from decimals to doubles for the obvious speed advantage, except that at the end of the day, I still use the ToString method to transmit prices to exchanges, and need to make sure it always outputs the number I expect. (89.99 instead of 89.99000000001) Questions: Is the speed advantage really as large as naive tests suggest? (~100 times) Is there a way to guarantee the output from ToString to be what I want? Is this assured by the fact that my number is always representable? UPDATE: I have to process ~ 10 billion price updates before my app can run, and I have implemented with decimal right now for the obvious protective reasons, but it takes ~3 hours just to turn on, doubles would dramatically reduce my turn on time. Is there a safe way to do it with doubles?

@TITLE:How can an iOS app keep a TCP connection alive indefinitely while in the background?
@CONTENT:An iPhone app, connecting to a remote server via TCP. The use scenarios are: app (user) sends data to server and server responds data back. server might send data to app while it does nothing. Assume that if app does not send data to server for 30 minutes, server will close the connection. I want to keep the connection alive for 120 minutes even if user does nothing. Case 1: if app is in foreground, I can use timer to send some do-nothing data to server. No problem. Case 2: if user pressed Home and app went to background, what could I do? I don't wan to show alert or something to interrupt user(he is away or playing games). I just wanna keep the connection alive for a longer period and when user comes back to the app, he found out that the connection will be still alive and be happy with that. I have read documentations about background execution, multitasking, and local notifications of iphone APIs. I'm not sure whether if I can achieve Case 2. Only use legal APIs, no jailbreaking.

@TITLE:django: Purpose of django.utils.functional.SimpleLazyObject?
@CONTENT:I ran into an issue where I assigned request.user to a variable called prior_user, then essentially authenticated the user, then checked to see if request.user != prior_user. I expected them not to be the same and that prior_user should contain `AnonymousUser. To my surprise, they were the same. Sample code: prior_user = request.user   # request object, obtained froma  view
authenticate_user(request)   # some function that authenticates
print prior_user.username != request.user.username   # returns False i.e.they are the same!
 I then discovered prior_user actually contains an instance of django.utils.functional.SimpleLazyObject so I assume it is some sort of lazy lookup type thing i.e. prior_user's value isn't looked up until actually used. Looking at the source code, I cannot confirm this. Anyone with django experience can tell me what is going on and why it is needed? This leaves me a little shaken, because the usual assignment statement doesn't work the way I expect and what else within Django acts like this? Nor did I see this described in the docs. So anyone with super human knowledge of django can provide some clarity?
@CODE:request.user prior_user request.user != prior_user prior_user prior_user = request.user   # request object, obtained froma  view
authenticate_user(request)   # some function that authenticates

@TITLE:Check if object is Class type
@CONTENT:I have a method that receives a NSArray of Class objects and I need to check if they all are Class type generated with the code bellow: NSMutableArray *arr = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

[arr addObject:[NSObject class]];
[arr addObject:[NSValue class]];
[arr addObject:[NSNumber class]];
[arr addObject:[NSPredicate class]];
[arr addObject:@"not a class object"];
 The problem is that Class is not an objective-c class, it is a struc, so I can not use just     for (int i; i<[arr count]; i++) {
        Class obj = [arr objectAtIndex:i];

        if([obj isKindOfClass: [Class class]]) {
            //do sth
        }
    }
 So, I need to I check if the obj variable is a Class type, I suppose it will be in C directly, but how can I do that? It will be a plus if the answer also provide a way to check if the item in the array is a NSObject, as the items in the example code, the NSPredicate would also be true for the NSObject check
@CODE:NSArray Class Class NSMutableArray *arr = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

[arr addObject:[NSObject class]];

@LINK:/questions/3691625/why-are-php-function-calls-so-expensive
@TITLE:Why are PHP function calls *so* expensive?
@CONTENT:A function call in PHP is expensive. Here is a small benchmark to test it: // create test string
$string = str_repeat('a', 1000);
$maxChars = 500;

// with function call
$start = microtime(true);
for ($i = 0; $i < RUNS; ++$i) {
    strlen($string) <= $maxChars;
}
echo 'with function call: ', microtime(true) - $start, "\n";

// without function call
$start = microtime(true);
for ($i = 0; $i < RUNS; ++$i) {
    !isset($string[$maxChars]);
}
echo 'without function call: ', microtime(true) - $start;
 This tests a functionally identical code using a function first (strlen) and then without using a function (isset isn't a function). I get the following output: with function call:    4.5108239650726
without function call: 0.84017300605774
 As you can see the implementation using a function call is more than five (5.38) times slower than the implementation not calling any function. I would like to know why a function call is so expensive. What's the main bottleneck? Is it the lookup in the hash table? Or what is so slow? I revisited this question, and decided to run the benchmark again, with XDebug completely disabled (not just profiling disabled). This showed, that my tests were fairly convoluted, this time, with 10000000 runs I got: with function call:    3.152988910675
without function call: 1.4107749462128
 Here a function call only is approximately twice (2.23) as slow, so the difference is by far smaller. I just tested the above code on a PHP 5.4.0 snapshot and got the following results: with function call:    2.3795559406281
without function call: 0.90840601921082
 Here the difference got slightly bigger again (2.62). (But on the over hand the execution time of both methods dropped quite significantly).
@CODE:// create test string
$string = str_repeat('a', 1000);
$maxChars = 500;

// with function call
$start = microtime(true);
for ($i = 0; $i < RUNS; ++$i) {
    strlen($string) <= $maxChars;
}
echo 'with function call: ', microtime(true) - $start, "\n";

// without function call
$start = microtime(true);

    !isset($string[$maxChars]);

 quot is integer division truncated toward zero, while the result of div is truncated toward negative infinity. For example: Prelude> (-12) `quot` 5

@TITLE:pip installing in global site-packages instead of virtualenv
@CONTENT:Using pip to install a package in a virtualenv causes the package to be installed in the global site-packages folder instead of the one in the virtualenv folder. Here's how I set up Python3 and virtualenv on OS X Mavericks (10.9.1): I installed python3 using Homebrew: ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
brew install python3 --with-brewed-openssl
 Changed the $PATH variable in .bash_profile; added the following line: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
 Running which python3 returns /usr/local/bin/python3 (after restarting the shell). Note: which python3 still returns /usr/bin/python though. Installed virtualenv using pip3: pip3 install virtualenv
 Next, create a new virtualenv and activate it: virtualenv testpy3 -p python3
cd testpy3
source bin/activate
 Note: if I don't specify -p python3, pip will be missing from the bin folder in the virtualenv. Running which pip and which pip3 both return the virtualenv folder: /Users/kristof/VirtualEnvs/testpy3/bin/pip3
 Now, when I try to install e.g. Markdown using pip in the activated virtualenv, pip will install in the global site-packages folder instead of the site-packages folder of the virtualenv. pip install markdown
 Running pip list returns: Markdown (2.3.1)
pip (1.4.1)
setuptools (2.0.1)
virtualenv (1.11)

 As you can see, the global site-packages folder contains Markdown, the virtualenv folder doesn't. Note: I had Python2 and Python3 installed before on a different VM (followed these instructions) and had the same issue with Python3; installing packages in a Python2 based virtualenv worked flawlessly though. Any tips, hints, K would be very much appreciated.

@TITLE:Entity framework, problems updating related objects
@CONTENT:I am currently working on a project using the latest version of Entity Framework and I have come across an issue which I can not seem to solve. When it comes to updating existing objects, I can fairly easily update the object properties ok, until it comes to a property which is a reference to another class. In the below example I have a class called Foo, which stores various properties, with 2 of these being instances of other classes public class Foo
{
     public int Id {get; set;}
     public string Name {get; set;}
     public SubFoo SubFoo {get; set}
     public AnotherSubFoo AnotherSubFoo {get; set}
}
 When I use the below Edit method, I pass in the object I wish to update and I can manage to get the Name to properly update, however I have not managed to find a way in which to get the properties of the SubFoo to change. For example, if the SubFoo class has a property of Name, and this has been changed and is different between my DB and the newFoo, it does not get updated. public Foo Edit(Foo newFoo)
{

        var dbFoo = context.Foo
                           .Include(x => x.SubFoo)
                           .Include(x => x.AnotherSubFoo)
                           .Single(c => c.Id == newFoo.Id);



        var entry = context.Entry<Foo>(dbFoo);
        entry.OriginalValues.SetValues(dbFoo);
        entry.CurrentValues.SetValues(newFoo);

        context.SaveChanges();

        return newFoo;
}
 Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Based on the comment by Slauma I have modified my method to public Foo Edit(Foo newFoo)
{

        var dbFoo = context.Foo
                           .Include(x => x.SubFoo)
                           .Include(x => x.AnotherSubFoo)
                           .Single(c => c.Id == newFoo.Id);



        context.Entry(dbFoo).CurrentValues.SetValues(newFoo);
        context.Entry(dbFoo.SubFoo).CurrentValues.SetValues(newFoo.SubFoo);

        context.SaveChanges();

        return newFoo;
}
 When running this now, I get the error 'The entity type Collection`1 is not part of the model for the current context.'
 To try and get around this, I added code to try to attach the newFoo subclasses to the context, but this through an error saying that the ObjectManager already had an entity the same An object with the same key already exists in the ObjectStateManager. The

@TITLE:What is the best way to delete old rows from MySQL on a rolling basis?
@CONTENT:I find myself wanting to delete rows older than (x)-days on a rolling basis in a lot of applications. What is the best way to do this most efficiently on a high-traffic table? For instance, if I have a table that stores notifications and I only want to keep these for 7 days. Or high scores that I only want to keep for 31 days. Right now I keep a row storing the epoch time posted and run a cron job that runs once per hour and deletes them in increments like this: DELETE FROM my_table WHERE time_stored < 1234567890 LIMIT 100
 I do that until mysql_affected_rows returns 0. I used to do it all at once but that caused everything in the application to hang for 30 seconds or so while INSERTS piled up. Adding the LIMIT worked to alleviate this but I'm wondering if there is a better way to do this.

@TITLE:Initialize Google Map in AngularJS
@CONTENT:I am considering migrating from backbonejs to angularjs. In backbone I am able to initialize a view at which point I create an instance of google map. I can then pan/zoom/etc and switch between views and not lose the current state of the map. Given the following using angularjs: layout.html <body>
  <div class="container-fluid" ng-view></div>
 map.html <div id="map_canvas" ng-controller="MapCtrl"></div>
 I was able to create a directive to render a map just fine. Problem is that it reloads the map each time I switch back to the map view. <map></map>
 So from what I am learning about Angular, I figured I would create a MapController and initialize the map there. No success. Bottom line is I need to async-init a google map and push data to it locally or remotely AND be able to navigate the app without RELOADING the map from scratch each time. Can someone suggest the correct approach? Thank you :) Attempt Per Andy Joslin suggestion: In app.js: // Generated by CoffeeScript 1.3.3

@TITLE:AuthenticateRequest event
@CONTENT:Q 1. To my understanding FormsAuthenticationModule is subscribed to AuthenticateRequest event, and thus only after this event is fired, is FormsAuthenticationModule called. But the following quotes got me a bit confused: The AuthenticateRequest event signals that the configured authentication mechanism has authenticated the current request. Doesnt the above quote suggest that when AuthenticateRequest event is raised, request (aka user) is already authenticated? Subscribing to the AuthenticateRequest event ensures that the request will be authenticated before processing the attached module or event handler. As far as I understand this quote, if we subscribe to AuthenticatedRequest, then our event handler will be called prior to FormsAuthenticationModule? Thus Application_AuthenticateRequest() will be called before FormsAuthenticationModule is called? Q 2. Book Im learning from suggests that within Application_AuthenticateRequest() we are able to verify whether user is a member of specific role, and if not, we can add the user automatically:     protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
            if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated && Roles.Enabled)
            {

                //here we can subscribe user to a role via Roles.AddUserToRole()
            }       
    }
 Judging from the above code, Application_AuthenticateRequest() is called after FormsAuthenticationModule has been invoked, but somewhere else same book implies that Application_AuthenticateRequest() is called prior to FormsAuthenticationModule: Application_AuthenticateRequest is called just before authentication is performed. This is a jumping-off point for creating your own authentication logic. What am I missing? Thanx
@CODE:FormsAuthenticationModule AuthenticateRequest FormsAuthenticationModule AuthenticateRequest AuthenticateRequest AuthenticateRequest AuthenticatedRequest FormsAuthenticationModule Application_AuthenticateRequest() FormsAuthenticationModule Application_AuthenticateRequest() protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e)

@TITLE:Which iOS app version/build number(s) MUST be incremented upon App Store release?
@CONTENT:The three version/build fields for an iOS app are: "Version" CFBundleShortVersionString (String - iOS, OS X) specifies the release version number of the bundle, which identifies a released iteration of the app. The release version number is a string comprised of three period-separated integers. "Build" CFBundleVersion (String - iOS, OS X) specifies the build version number of the bundle, which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the bundle. The build version number should be a string comprised of three non-negative, period-separated integers with the first integer being greater than zero. The string should only contain numeric (0-9) and period (.) characters. Leading zeros are truncated from each integer and will be ignored (that is, 1.02.3 is equivalent to 1.2.3). This key is not localizable. "iTunes Connect Version Number": version number you specify when creating a new version of the app on iTunes Connect. My question is: Which version/build numbers are required to be incremented when a new version of the app is uploaded to the App Store? Can either CFBundleShortVersionString or CFBundleVersion remain the same between app updates? Extra points for Apple sources or the exact error messages iTunesConnect displays upon uploading an invalid version/build number. Android / Google Play Note: The discussion prompting this question is that the public "version" of an Android app in the Google Play Store does not need to be incremented and is in no way validated. The android:versionName can remain the same between releases, upgrade, downgrade, or be any random string rather than something that appears to be a valid "version number". android:versionName X A string value that represents the release version of the application code, as it should be shown to users. The value is a string so that you can describe the application version as a <major>.<minor>.<point> string, or as any other type of absolute or relative version identifier. Whereas the android:versionCode is enforced to be an incrementing-on-release integer.

@TITLE:HTML5 video element request stay pending forever (on chrome)
@CONTENT:I have a weird issue in Chrome. Each time I load a <video> element, chrome will start two HTTP request. The first one will stay pending forever (I guess this is the "meta-data", "partial content" request. But the point is that it stay pending) The second one to the same file is ok and goes on and close after the loading is over. The problem here is that the first request stay pending until I close the browser page. So at some point, if I load multiple video, Chrome will break and stop downloading anything because every available request is occupied by these pending requests. I created a reduced test case here: http://jsbin.com/ixifiq/3 I've check to reproduce the issue, and it is happening on both Video.js and MediaElements.js frontpages. Open your network tab when loading the page, you'll see the first pending request. Then press play on the video, and you'll see the second request working, but the first one will stay pending forever. Does anyone knows a fix to this bug?

The web service interface is very rich, and the generated "Reference.cs" is some 90k loc. I'm using the web reference in a console application. I often change something, recompile and run. Compilation is fast, but newing up the web service reference is very slow, taking some 15-20 seconds: CrmService service = new CrmService(); Profiling reveals that all time is spent in the SoapHttpClientProtocol constructor. The culprit is apparently the fact that the XML serialization code (not included in the 90k loc mentioned above) is generated at run time, before being JIT'ed. This happens during the constructor call. The wait is rather frustrating when playing around and trying things out. I've tried various combinations of sgen.exe, ngen and XGenPlus (which takes several hours and generates 500MB of additional code) but to no avail. I've considered implementing a Windows service that have few CrmService instances ready to dish out when needed but that seems excessive. Any ideas?

    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn
    @JoinColumn(name = "lead_id")
    public Lead getLead()
    {

    }
}
 and the code below is being used to save the entity: LeadAffiliate aff = new LeadAffiliate();

aff.setLead(lead);
lead.setLeadAffiliate(aff);

em.persist(lead);
 This all works perfectly fine in hibernate 3.5.0-Final. When attempting to upgrade to 3.5.6-Final or 3.6.0.Final is when I start getting the "null id generated for LeadAffiliate" error: javax.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.id.IdentifierGenerationException: null id generated for:class com.sellingsource.bizdev.entities.LeadAffiliate

 As an aside, I am not sure that the annotations on Lead Affiliate were quite right to begin with. They worked, but seemed kind of kludgey. So I have since changed them to: @Entity
@Table(name = "lead_affiliate")
public class LeadAffiliate
{
    private Long leadId;

    private Lead lead;

    @Id
    @GenericGenerator(name = "foreign", strategy = "foreign", parameters = {
                    @org.hibernate.annotations.Parameter(name = "property", value="lead")
    })
    @GeneratedValue(generator = "foreign")
    public Long getLeadId()
    {
        return leadId;
    }

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "leadAffiliate")
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn
    public Lead getLead()
    {
        return lead;
    }
}
 However, with these changes I get the same result. (Works in 3.5.0 but not 3.5.6 or 3.6.0) Is there a new way I need to be doing this or is this a bug? My concern is that my code is currently working because of a bug :/.

@TITLE:How to mimic Keyboard animation on iOS 7 to add Done button to numeric keyboard?
@CONTENT:I had been doing something like this to mimic the keyboard animation on older version of iOS. CGRect keyboardBeginFrame;
[[note.userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey] getValue:&keyboardBeginFrame];
self.doneKeyboardButton.frame = CGRectMake(0, (keyboardBeginFrame.origin.y + keyboardBeginFrame.size.height) - 53, 106, 53);
[[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] windows] lastObject] addSubview:self.doneKeyboardButton];

CGPoint newCenter = CGPointMake(self.doneKeyboardButton.superview.frame.origin.x + self.doneKeyboardButton.frame.size.width/2,
                                self.doneKeyboardButton.superview.frame.size.height - self.doneKeyboardButton.frame.size.height/2);

[UIView animateWithDuration:[[note.userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey] floatValue]-.02
                      delay:.0
                    options:[[note.userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey] intValue]

                     self.contentView.frame = CGRectOffset(self.contentView.frame, 0, -TextFieldViewMovement);
                     self.doneKeyboardButton.center = newCenter;
                 }
                 completion:nil];
 However, this has stopped working on iOS7. It seems like the values returned are no longer exactly correct, and the Done button no longer exactly mimics the Keyboard display animation.

@TITLE:Is it possible to override MultipartFormDataStreamProvider so that is doesn't save uploads to the file system?
@CONTENT:I have an ASP.Net Web API application that allows clients (html pages and iPhone apps) to upload images to. I am using an async upload task as described in this article. Everything works great when I want to save to the file system because that's what this code does automatically, behind the scenes it seems. But, I don't want to save the uploaded files to the file system. Instead, I want to take the uploaded stream and pass it through to an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for .Net. I have the code set up to send the stream up to AWS. The problem I can't figure out is how to get the uploaded content stream from the Web API method instead of having it automatically save to disk. I was hoping there would be a virtual method I could override in MultipartFormDataStreamProvider which would allow me to do something else with the uploaded content other than save to disk, but there doesn't seem to be. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:Timezones in SQL DATE vs java.sql.Date
@CONTENT:I'm getting a bit confused by the behaviour of the SQL DATE data type vs. that of java.sql.Date. Take the following statement, for example: select cast(? as date)           -- in most databases
select cast(? as date) from dual -- in Oracle
 Let's prepare and execute the statement with Java PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
stmt.setDate(1, new java.sql.Date(0)); // GMT 1970-01-01 00:00:00
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
rs.next();

// I live in Zurich, which is CET, not GMT. So the following prints -3600000, 
// which is CET 1970-01-01 00:00:00
// ... or   GMT 1969-12-31 23:00:00
System.out.println(rs.getDate(1).getTime());
 In other words, the GMT timestamp I bind to the statement becomes the CET timestamp I get back. At what step is the timezone added and why? Note: I have observed this to be true for any of these databases: DB2, Derby, H2, HSQLDB, Ingres, MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, SQL Server, Sybase ASE, Sybase SQL Anywhere I have observed this to be false for SQLite (which doesn't really have true DATE data types) All of this is irrelevant when using java.sql.Timestamp instead of java.sql.Date This is a similar question, which doesn't answer this question, however: java.util.Date vs java.sql.Date
@CODE:java.sql.Date select cast(? as date)           -- in most databases
select cast(? as date) from dual -- in Oracle PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
stmt.setDate(1, new java.sql.Date(0)); // GMT 1970-01-01 00:00:00

I have a create button for businesses so should I put the code into a create.js.erb file or put it into my application.js using: $("#business_submit").click(function() {}
 All that aside is that I have my create button     $('.error').hide();
$("#business_submit").click(function() {
    // validate and process form here

    $('.error').hide();
    var name = $("input#business_name").val();

        return false;
    }
    $("#new_business")[0].reset();
    $("#new_business").toggle();
   return false;
});
 This works great in my .js file but when I click create it doesn't actually send the information they typed in the form to the database. So I tried copy pasting the code into the .js.erb file. Now the form is submitted to the database when I click create, but half the javascript isn't working. The $('.error').hide(); isn't hiding my errors and they are all showing up regardless. $("#new_business")[0].reset(); isn't reseting my form, and there is no validation checks when I click create. So I either have a fully functional form that doesn't submit or one that submits but isn't really functional. Which one should I try to get working? I see a lot of code with $.ajax but I can't figure it out for the life of me. I tried for a bit and I started getting some forgery protection errors in rails which is a whole other problem.
@CODE:$("#business_submit").click(function() {} $('.error').hide();
$("#business_submit").click(function() {
    // validate and process form here

    $('.error').hide();
    var name = $("input#business_name").val();
    if (name == ""  || name == "Required Field") {
        $('#namelabel').show()
        $("#business_name").focus();
        return false;
    }
    var address = $("#business_address").val();
    if (address == ""  || address == "Required Field") {
        $('#addresslabel').show();
        $("#business_address").focus();

@TITLE:ObservableCollection and Item PropertyChanged
@CONTENT:I've seen lots of talk about this question but maybe I'm just too much of a newbie to get it. If I have an observable collection that is a collection of "PersonNames" as in the msdn example (http: //msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms748365.aspx), I get updates to my View if a PersonName is added or removed, etc. I want to get an update to my View when I change a property in the PersonName as well. Like if I change the first name. I can implement OnPropertyChanged for each property and have this class derive from INotifyPropertyChanged and that seems to get called as expected. My question is, how does the View get the updated data from the ObservableCollection as the property changed does not cause any event for the ObservableCollection. This is probably something really simple but why I can't seem to find an example surprises me. Can anyone shed any light on this for me or have any pointers to examples I would greatly appreciate it. We have this scenario in multiple places in our current WPF app and are struggling with figuring it out. "Generally, the code responsible for displaying the data adds a PropertyChanged event handler to each object currently displayed onscreen." Could someone please give me an example of what this means? My View binds to my ViewModel which has a ObservableCollection. This collection is made up of a RowViewModel which has properties that support the PropertiesChanged event. But I can't figure out how to make the collection update itself so my view will be updated.

However, I can't seem to figure out how to use HTML5 to properly drag and drop the tag so that it can be placed anywhere on the screen (well, or within a <div> element). After reading on HTML5's drag and drop support, I have a basic understanding of how it works, but I'm not sure where to start when it comes to allowing the div to be placed anywhere (it's z-index is a high value, so as I said, overlapping is fine). Any suggestions? Oh, and I'd like to try and avoid using external libraries for this project, wherever possible. I'm trying to do this in pure JavaScript/HTML5.

For reference, here is a screenshot of my package hierarchy: I suspect that I'm missing something in web.xml, but I have no idea what it is. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

I would love to use something like tramp which I understand would have the buffer open on my local machine and only talk through the network when I save to disk. I am not very familiar with tramp at all and struggling to get it to work, especially through the double hop. The documentation says this is accomplished through defining proxies in tramp, but I am unable to understand the syntax. Does anyone know how to use emacs to code through a double hop or have an alternate workaround for editing code through two ssh hops?

@CONTENT:On the iPhone, a maps.google.com URL is intercepted and loaded by the native google maps application. I would like do the same on Android, but Google Maps is being loaded in the browser. So, in a web page, is it possible to have this url http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=brighton&daddr=timbuktu open in the Android Google Map application ? I see from this question that you can do it from another app via an Intent. Can you trigger these Intent's from the browser ? Edit - On further testing, I've found that the user will be prompted to open the link in browser or map app for standard html links to maps.google.maps : <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=brighton&daddr=timbuktu">show route</a>
 I'm having the problem because I'm using javascript to set the window.location.href via a Location API callback (so I can get the user's location and then open the map). I've opened a bug report for this.

    self.backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor()
  }

  required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {

    // Set the circle outerline-width
    CGContextSetLineWidth(context, 5.0);

    // Set the circle outerline-colour
    UIColor.redColor().set()

    // Create Circle
    CGContextAddArc(context, (frame.size.width)/2, frame.size.height/2, (frame.size.width - 10)/2, 0.0, CGFloat(M_PI * 2.0), 1)

    // Draw

    var circleWidth = CGFloat(200)
    var circleHeight = circleWidth
    // Create a new CircleView

    view.addSubview(circleView)

@TITLE:table header view height is wrong when using auto layout, IB, and font sizes
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a header view for my uiTableView (not a section header, I already have those.) I have set up an XIB in interface builder. All the connections are hooked up and it runs beautifully... except the table doesn't give it enough room! My problem is that the top of the table overlaps the table's header by a little. My XIB is setup with autlayout for all the buttons, and IB is happy that the constraints don't conflict / ambiguous. The view is set to Freeform size, which in my case ended up being 320 x 471. Then in constraints for the view, I set an intrinsic size for the view of the same. Now this works perfectly with my table. Everything looks great. But if I manually change any of the fonts in the header view with code, the layout makes the view bigger, and it ends up underneath my table. Any ideas how to get the tableviewcontroller to leave enough room for the header view after setting fonts and sizes? I hope I've made sense explaining this.

The interceptor logic include send errors messages to server using $http in case necessary, BUT I don't want send errors messages to the server about errors messages, I mean, I want disable my interceptor while sending error message to the server. My idea was create a service named 'remote_log' and put inside it all the code needed to send error to server. That service of course will use the $http service and have it in its dependency list. Then add as dependency of the interceptor to the 'remote_log' service, and use the 'remote_log' inside the interceptor when need send errors to the server. The problems is that: Interceptors must be defined using the $httpProvider when the $http service still is not instantiated/accessible, so, inside the interceptor code can't be a dependency to that the $http service because a "Circular dependency" error happen. I think my only option is create a separate instance of the $http service inside my 'remote_log', an instance that don't uses the $httpProvider configuration I set while creating the interceptor. My question is: How can I do that? Any other ideas?

@TITLE:What GC parameters is a JVM running with?
@CONTENT:I'm still investigating issues I have with GC tuning (see prior question), which involves lots of reading and experimentation. Sun Java5+ JVMs attempt to automatically select the optimal GC strategy and parameters based on their environment, which is great, but I can't figure out how to query the running JVM to find out what those parameters are. Ideally, I'd like to see what values of the various GC-related -XX options are being used, as selected automatically by the VM. If I had that, I could have a baseline to begin tweaking. Anyone know to recover these values from a running VM?

@TITLE:HTTPWebResponse + StreamReader Very Slow
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a limited web crawler in C# (for a few hundred sites only) using HttpWebResponse.GetResponse() and Streamreader.ReadToEnd() , also tried using StreamReader.Read() and a loop to build my HTML string. I'm only downloading pages which are about 5-10K. It's all very slow! For example, the average GetResponse() time is about half a second, while the average StreamREader.ReadToEnd() time is about 5 seconds! All sites should be very fast, as they are very close to my location, and have fast servers. (in Explorer takes practically nothing to D/L) and I am not using any proxy. My Crawler has about 20 threads reading simultaneously from the same site. Could this be causing a problem? How do I reduce StreamReader.ReadToEnd times DRASTICALLY?

@LINK:/questions/852441/fat-models-skinny-viewmodels-and-dumb-views-the-best-mvvm-approach
@TITLE:Fat Models, skinny ViewModels and dumb Views, the best MVVM approach?
@CONTENT:Through generous help on this question, I put together the following MVVM structure which displays the changes of a model in real time in XAML (current date/time), very nice. A cool advantage of this set up is that when you look at your view in design mode of Visual Studio or Blend, you see the time ticking by, which means that at design time you have access to live data from your model. In the process of getting this to work, I was surprised to see most of the bulk move from my ViewModel into my Model, including implementation of INotifyPropertyChange. Another change is that I no longer bind to properties on the ViewModel but to methods. So currently this is my favorite flavor of MVVM: View is dumb: one ObjectDataProvider for each object you need from your model each ObjectDataProvider maps to a method on the ViewModel (not a property) no x:Name properties in XAML elements ViewModel is skinny: the only thing in your ViewModel are the methods to which your view binds Model is fat: the model implements INotifyPropertyChanged on each of its properties. for every method on your ViewModel (e.g. GetCurrentCustomer) there is a corresponding singleton method in your Model (e.g. GetCurrentCustomer). the model takes care of any real time threading functionality as in this example Questions: Those of you who have been implementing MVVM in real scenarios, is this the basic structure you have also settled upon, and if not, how does yours vary? How would you extend this to include routed commands and routed events? The following code will work if you just copy the XAML and code behind into a new WPF project.

@TITLE:Serialize and send a data structure using Boost?
@CONTENT:I have a data structure that looks like this: 
typedef struct
{
  unsigned short m_short1;
  unsigned short m_short2;
  unsigned char m_character;
} MyDataType;
 I want to use boost::serialization to serialize this data structure, then use boost::asio to transmit it via TCP/IP, then have another application receive the data and de-serialize it using the same boost libraries. I'm trying to following boost::serialization tutorial, (as some other SO questions have suggested) but the example is specifically for writing/reading to a file, not to a socket using boost::asio. I'm pretty sure I've got the right tools for the job -- I just need help making them work together. Writing to a socket can't be that different from writing to a file, right? Any suggestions are very much appreciated. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a few areas on my site where I need to limit text input to X amount of characters and it's nice to show a number of spaces left while a user types in, like twitter does. I found this jquery plugin; jquery max-length plugin It does just what I need but it seems kind of like overkill, I am not sure the filesize but it looks like a lot of lines of code for such a simple task, do you think I would be better off using a non-jquery method? The reason I was thinking jquery was the way to go is because jquery is already included into all my pages UPDATE; I just found this non-jquery method that does the exact same thing is is way smaller footprint, so would this be the better method? <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">

@LINK:/questions/12730477/close-is-not-closing-socket-properly
@TITLE:close() is not closing socket properly
@CONTENT:I have a multi-threaded server (thread pool) that is handling a large number of requests (up to 500/sec for one node), using 20 threads. There's a listener thread that accepts incoming connections and queues them for the handler threads to process. Once the response is ready, the threads then write out to the client and close the socket. All seemed to be fine until recently, a test client program started hanging randomly after reading the response. After a lot of digging, it seems that the close() from the server is not actually disconnecting the socket. I've added some debugging prints to the code with the file descriptor number and I get this type of output. Processing request for 21
Writing to 21
Closing 21
 The return value of close() is 0, or there would be another debug statement printed. After this output with a client that hangs, lsof is showing an established connection. SERVER 8160 root 21u IPv4 32754237 TCP localhost:9980->localhost:47530 (ESTABLISHED) CLIENT 17747 root 12u IPv4 32754228 TCP localhost:47530->localhost:9980 (ESTABLISHED) It's as if the server never sends the shutdown sequence to the client, and this state hangs until the client is killed, leaving the server side in a close wait state SERVER 8160 root 21u IPv4 32754237 TCP localhost:9980->localhost:47530 (CLOSE_WAIT) Also if the client has a timeout specified, it will timeout instead of hanging. I can also manually run call close(21)
 in the server from gdb, and the client will then disconnect. This happens maybe once in 50,000 requests, but might not happen for extended periods.

 These have made no difference. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. EDIT---------- Here's some updated info on this issue. I've replaced the thread-safe queue we are using and it seems resolved. The old implementation used condition variables and with waiting/broadcasting to signal new queue readiness. The new queue I'm using simply uses a defined size with semaphore locking. Both queues are correctly implemented, and I am currently assuming the pthread_condition_broadcast signals somehow interfere with the close call. Not sure about that, but getting rid of the signals stops this from happening. The threads were always working with the same socket once it was pulled off the queue, so it couldn't be any mixup there.

@LINK:/questions/2929401/dsp-filtering-in-the-frequency-domain-via-fft
@TITLE:DSP - Filtering in the frequency domain via FFT
@CONTENT:I've been playing around a little with the Exocortex implementation of the FFT, but I'm having some problems. Whenever I modify the amplitudes of the frequency bins before calling the iFFT the resulting signal contains some clicks and pops, especially when low frequencies are present in the signal (like drums or basses). However, this does not happen if I attenuate all the bins by the same factor. Let me put an example of the output buffer of a 4-sample FFT: // Bin 0 (DC)
FFTOut[0] = 0.0000610351563
FFTOut[1] = 0.0

// Bin 1
FFTOut[2] = 0.000331878662
FFTOut[3] = 0.000629425049

// Bin 2
FFTOut[4] = -0.0000381469727
FFTOut[5] =  0.0

// Bin 3, this is the first and only negative frequency bin.
FFTOut[6] =  0.000331878662
FFTOut[7] = -0.000629425049
 The output is composed of pairs of floats, each representing the real and imaginay parts of a single bin. So, bin 0 (array indexes 0, 1) would represent the real and imaginary parts of the DC frequency. As you can see, bins 1 and 3 both have the same values, (except for the sign of the Im part), so I guess bin 3 is the first negative frequency, and finally indexes (4, 5) would be the last positive frequency bin. Then to attenuate the frequency bin 1 this is what I do: // Attenuate the 'positive' bin
FFTOut[2] *= 0.5;
FFTOut[3] *= 0.5;

// Attenuate its corresponding negative bin.
FFTOut[6] *= 0.5;
FFTOut[7] *= 0.5;
 For the actual tests I'm using a 1024-length FFT and I always provide all the samples so no 0-padding is needed. // Attenuate
var halfSize = fftWindowLength / 2;
float leftFreq = 0f;
float rightFreq = 22050f; 
for( var c = 1; c < halfSize; c++ )
{
    var freq = c * (44100d / halfSize);

    // Calc. positive and negative frequency indexes.
    var k = c * 2;
    var nk = (fftWindowLength - c) * 2;

    // This kind of attenuation corresponds to a high-pass filter.
    // The attenuation at the transition band is linearly applied, could
    // this be the cause of the distortion of low frequencies?
    var attn = (freq < leftFreq) ? 
                    0 : 
                    (freq < rightFreq) ? 
                        ((freq - leftFreq) / (rightFreq - leftFreq)) :
                        1;

    // Attenuate positive and negative bins.
    mFFTOut[ k ] *= (float)attn;
    mFFTOut[ k + 1 ] *= (float)attn;
    mFFTOut[ nk ] *= (float)attn;
    mFFTOut[ nk + 1 ] *= (float)attn;
}
 Obviously I'm doing something wrong but can't figure out what. I don't want to use the FFT output as a means to generate a set of FIR coefficients since I'm trying to implement a very basic dynamic equalizer. What's the correct way to filter in the frequency domain? what I'm missing? Also, is it really needed to attenuate negative frequencies as well? I've seen an FFT implementation where neg. frequency values are zeroed before synthesis. Thanks in advance.

The gist of it is that the GIL is a pretty good design for single core systems (Python essentially leaves the thread handling/scheduling up to the operating system). But that this can seriously backfire on multi-core systems and you end up with IO intensive threads being heavily blocked by CPU intensive threads, the expense of context switching, the ctrl-C problem[*] and so on. So since the GIL limits us to basically executing a Python program on one CPU my thought is why not accept this and simply use taskset on Linux to set the affinity of the program to a certain core/cpu on the system (especially in a situation with multiple Python apps running on a multi-core system)? So ultimately my question is this: has anyone tried using taskset on Linux with Python applications (especially when running multiple applications on a Linux system so that multiple cores can be used with one or two Python applications bound to a specific core) and if so what were the results? is it worth doing? Does it make things worse for certain workloads? I plan to do this and test it out (basically see if the program takes more or less time to run) but would love to hear from others as to your experiences. Addition: David Beazley (the guy giving the talk in the linked video) pointed out that some C/C++ extensions manually release the GIL lock and if these extensions are optimized for multi-core (i.e. scientific or numeric data analysis/etc.) then rather than getting the benefits of multi-core for number crunching the extension would be effectively crippled in that it is limited to a single core (thus potentially slowing your program down significantly). On the other hand if you aren't using extensions such as this The reason I am not using the multiprocessing module is that (in this case) part of the program is heavily network I/O bound (HTTP requests) so having a pool of worker threads is a GREAT way to squeeze performance out of a box since a thread fires off an HTTP request and then since it's waiting on I/O gives up the GIL and another thread can do it's thing, so that part of the program can easily run 100+ threads without hurting the CPU much and let me actually use the network bandwidth that is available. As for stackless Python/etc I'm not overly interested in rewriting the program or replacing my Python stack (availability would also be a concern). [*] Only the main thread can receive signals so if you send a ctrl-C the Python interpreter basically tries to get the main thread to run so it can handle the signal, but since it doesn't directly control which thread is run (this is left to the operating system) it basically tells the OS to keep switching threads until it eventually hits the main thread (which if you are unlucky may take a while).

@TITLE:How to detect iPhone movement in space using accelerometer?
@CONTENT:I am trying to make an application that would detect what kind of shape you made with your iPhone using accelerometer. As an example, if you draw a circle with your hand holding the iPhone, the app would be able to redraw it on the screen. This could also work with squares, or even more complicated shapes. The only example of application I've seen doing such a thing is AirPaint (http://vimeo.com/2276713), but it doesn't seems to be able to do it in real time. My first try is to apply a low-pass filter on the X and Y parameters from the accelerometer, and to make a pointer move toward these values, proportionally to the size of the screen. But this is clearly not enought, I have a very low accuracy, and if I shake the device it also makes the pointer move... Any ideas about that ? Do you think accelerometer data is enought to do it ? Or should I consider using other data, such as the compass ? Thanks in advance !

@TITLE:Is it possible to cache resources loaded in an iPhone UIWebView?
@CONTENT:I have a simple app loading a site optimized for the iPhone in a UIWebView. Problem is, caching does not seem to work: [webView loadRequest: [NSURLRequest requestWithURL: [NSURL URLWithString: url]
                                       cachePolicy: NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy
                                   timeoutInterval: 60.0]];
 Any things referenced in this remote page (css, images, external javascript files) never get cached (the requests never send a If-Modified-Since header or anything else in the way of cache control.) Is it possible? It seems with a regular Cocoa WebView there a delegate methods that get called for each resource request and post load (-didFinishLoadingFromDataSource:) which you could use to roll your own caching.. but that does not seem applicable here. My entire page (page and its referenced resources) is around 89K compressed.. which is slow over 3G in some spots and even worse over EDGE. Incoming requests are at least indicating that it accepts compression (accept-encoding=gzip, deflate), so that's good I suppose. I read this yui study, which seems to indicate that the iPhone will cache 25k per item. The only thing referenced that is over 25k uncompressed is jquery (packed but uncompressed - it is 30k). Everything else should be cacheable. No request for anything referenced in the page fetched is triggering a 304 on the server side. That yui study was from almost a year ago, and I am guessing with mobile safari only. This is using a UIWebView in a native iPhone app.

@TITLE:Detecting Acceleration in a car (iPhone Accelerometer)
@CONTENT:I am working on an iPhone app where we are trying to calculate the acceleration of a moving car. Similar apps have accomplished this (Dynolicious), but the difference is that this app is designed to be used during general city driving, not on a drag strip. This leads us to one big concern that Dynolicious was luckily able to avoid: hills. Yes, hills. There are two important stages to this: calibration, and actual driving. Our initial run was simple and suffered the consequences. During the calibration stage, I took the average force on the phone, and during running, I just subtracted the average force from the current force to get the current acceleration this frame. The problem with this is that the typical car receives much more force than just the forward force - everything from turning to potholes was causing the values to go out of sync with what was really happening. The next run was to add the condition that the iPhone must be oriented in such a way that the screen was facing toward the back of the car. Using this method, I attempted to follow only force on the z-axis, but this obviously lead to problems unless the iPhone was oriented directly upright, because of gravity. Some trigonometry later, and I had managed to work gravity out of the equation, so that the car was actually being read very, very well by the iPhone. Until I hit a slope. As soon as the angle of the car changed, suddenly I was receiving accelerations and decelerations that didn't make sense, and we were once again going out of sync. Talking with someone a lot smarter than me at math lead to a solution that I have been trying to implement for longer than I would like to admit. It's steps are as follows: 1) During calibration, measure gravity as a vector instead of a size. Store that vector. 2) When the car initially moves forward, take the vector of motion and subtract gravity. Use this as the forward momentum. (Ignore, for now, the user cases where this will be difficult and let's concentrate on the math :) 3) From the forward vector and the gravity vector, construct a plane. 4) Whenever a force is received, project it onto said plane to get rid of sideways force/etc. 5) Then, use that force, the known magnitude of gravity, and the known direction of forward motion to essentially solve a triangle to get the forward vector. The problem that is causing the most difficulty in this new system is not step 5, which I have gotten to the point where all the numbers look as they should. The difficult part is actually the detection of the forward vector. I am selecting vectors whose magnitude exceeds gravity, and from there, averaging them and subtracting gravity. (I am doing some error checking to make sure that I am not using a force just because the iPhone accelerometer was off by a bit, which happens more frequently than I would like). But if I plot these vectors that I am using, they actually vary by an angle of about 20-30 degrees, which can lead to some strong inaccuracies. The end result is that the app is even more inaccurate now than before. So basically - all you math and iPhone brains out there - any glaring errors? Any potentially better solutions? Any experience that could be useful at all? Award: offering a bounty of $250 to the first answer that leads to a solution.

@TITLE:Order of Serializer Validation in Django REST Framework
@CONTENT:Situation While working with validation in the Django REST Framework's ModelSerializer, I have noticed that the Meta.model fields are always validated, even when it does not necessarily make sense to do so. Take the following example for a User model's serialization: I have an endpoint that creates a user. As such, there is a password field and a confirm_password field. If the two fields do not match, the user cannot be created. Likewise, if the requested username already exists, the user cannot be created. The user POSTs improper values for each of the fields mentioned above An implementation of validate has been made in the serializer (see below), catching the non-matching password and confirm_password fields Implementation of validate: def validate(self, data):
    if data['password'] != data.pop('confirm_password'):
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Passwords do not match")
    return data
 Problem Even when the ValidationError is raised by validate, the ModelSerializer still queries the database to check to see if the username is already in use. This is evident in the error-list that gets returned from the endpoint; both the model and non-field errors are present. Consequently, I would like to know how to prevent model validation until after non-field validation has finished, saving me a call to my database. Attempt at solution I have been trying to go through the DRF's source to figure out where this is happening, but I have been unsuccessful in locating what I need to override in order to get this to work.

@CONTENT:I am displaying some simple styled text as html in a UIWebView on iPhone. It is basically a series of paragraphs with the occasional strong or emphasized phrase. At runtime I need to apply styles to ranges of text. There are a few similar scenarios, one of which is highlighting search results. If the user has searched for "something" I would like to change the background color behind occurrences of the word, then later restore the original background. Is it possible to apply styles to ranges of text using javascript? A key part of this is also being able to unset the styles. There seem to be two likely paths to follow. One would be modifying some html in Objective-C and passing it through javascript as the new innerHTML of some container. The other would be to use javascript to directly manipulate DOM nodes. I could manipulate html, but that sounds tedious in Objective-C so I would rather manipulate the DOM if that is a reasonable approach. I am not that familiar with javascript and DOM so I do not know if it is a reasonable approach. I wrote some routines to translate between text ranges and node ranges with offsets. So if I start with text range 100-200 and that starts in one paragraph and ends in a third, I can get the text nodes and the offsets within the nodes that represent the given text range. I just need a way to split a text node at an offset in the text. Currently I just apply styles to the paragraphs containing the text range. A few notes: straight javascript please, no external frameworks like jquery. the changes never need to be written to disk. the changes should be undoable or at least removable. the styles to apply already exist in a css file. it needs to work in iPhone 3.0 and forward. all the source files are shipped with the app. please be verbose.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a nib that contains a view that will be embedded in a TableViewCell. I've created the interface and implementation files, ResultCell.h and ResultCell.m. They're stock, out-of-the-box, no code changes. I then create an empty XIB file, and drag a UIView onto it. Then I click File's Owner, and set the type to ResultCell. I click the view, and set its class to also be ResultCell. Here are the problems I have: When using the Assistant Editor view (which I live in), the ResultCell.h file doesn't appear when I'm viewing the ResultCell.xib file. I have to force it to load by clicking on Automatic and selecting the file. When I drop a label in the view, and then Ctrl+Click and drag to the .h to create an outlet, I get this error message: "Could not insert new outlet connection: Could not find any information about the class named ResultCell." I've tried creating and re-creating the view, and it's just not working, and I've started to lose my patience. Any help would be very, very appreciated!

int y = (int)x;
 you get y=1. If you do this: int y = (int)Math.round(x);
 You'll likely get 2. However, I am wondering: since double representations of integers sometimes look like 1.9999999998 or something, is there a possibility that casting a double created via Math.round() will still result in a truncated down number, rather than the rounded number we are looking for (i.e.: 1 instead of 2 in the code as represented) ? (and yes, I do mean it as such: Is there any value for x, where y will show a result that is a truncated rather than a rounded representation of x?) If so: Is there a better way to make a double into a rounded int without running the risk of truncation? Figured something: Math.round(x) returns a long, not a double. Hence: it is impossible for Math.round() to return a number looking like 3.9999998. Therefore, int(Math.round()) will never need to truncate anything and will always work.

            <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Log in">
        </div>

    </fieldset>
</form>
 And the controller: var controller = function($scope) {

    $scope.login = {
        submit: function() {

            Console.info($scope.login.username + ' ' + $scope.login.password);
        }

};
 The problem is that the login.submit function will be called even if the input is not valid. Is it possible to prevent this behaviour? As a side note I can mention that I use bootstrap and requirejs as well.
@CODE:<form name="loginform" novalidate ng-submit="login.submit()" class="css-form">

@TITLE:Random data in Unit Tests?
@CONTENT:I have a coworker who writes unit tests for objects which fill their fields with random data. His reason is that it gives a wider range of testing, since it will test a lot of different values, whereas a normal test only uses a single static value. I've given him a number of different reasons against this, the main ones being: random values means the test isn't truly repeatable (which also means that if the test can randomly fail, it can do so on the build server and break the build) if it's a random value and the test fails, we need to a) fix the object and b) force ourselves to test for that value every time, so we know it works, but since it's random we don't know what the value was Another coworker added: If I am testing an exception, random values will not ensure that the test ends up in the expected state random data is used for flushing out a system and load testing, not for unit tests Can anyone else add additional reasons I can give him to get him to stop doing this? (Or alternately, is this an acceptable method of writing unit tests, and I and my other coworker are wrong?)

 And when I run it I get an error stating: The parameters dictionary does not contain a valid value of type 'System.Int32' for parameter 'firstItem'. To make a parameter optional its type should either be a reference type or a Nullable type. I had it working at one point and I decided to try the function without parameters.

 Any ideas why I would get this error and what I need to do to fix it? I've tried adding another method that takes an integer to the class it it also fails with the same reason.

@TITLE:How can I use jQuery validation with the chosen plugin?
@CONTENT:I have some <select> inputs using the chosen plugin that I want to validate as "required" on the client side. Since "chosen" hides the actual select element and creates a widget with divs and spans, native HTML5 validation doesn't seem to work properly. The form won't submit (which is good), but the error message is not shown, so the user has no idea what's wrong (which is not good). I've turned to the jQuery validation plugin (which I planned on using eventually anyways) but haven't had any luck so far. Here's my test case: <form>
    <label>Name: <input name="test1" required></label>
    <label>Favorite Color:
        <select name="test2" required>
            <option value=""></option>
            <option value="red">Red</option>
            <option value="blue">Blue</option>
            <option value="green">Green</option>

    </label>
    <input type="submit">
</form>
 $(document).ready(function(){
    $('select').chosen();
    $('form').validate();
});
 This is letting the select through with an empty value, without validating or showing the error message. When I comment out the chosen() line, it works fine. How can I validate chosen() inputs with the jQuery validation plugin, and show the error message for invalid ones?
@CODE:<select> <form>
    <label>Name: <input name="test1" required></label>

I was hoping someone could explain the difference between using a scope in an ActiveRecord model and just using a class method (ie self.some_method) From what I can gather, a scope is always expected to return a relation, whereas a class method doesn't necessarily have to.

  scope :grouped_counts, group(:name).count
end

 It does however work as a class method def self.grouped_counts

@CONTENT:I have no idea if this is even remotely correct. I have a class where I would like to update the database if the fields currently exist or insert if they do not. The complication is that I am doing a joining 3 tables (set_colors, school_art, baseimage) Any help would be really great. Here is what I have: public function set_layer_colors($value) {
global $db;

$result_array = mysql_query("
IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM set_colors WHERE school_art_id = '{$value}')

  UPDATE set_colors (school_art_id, baseimage_id, sub_folder, layer)
    SELECT school_art.id, baseimage.id, baseimage.sub_folder, baseimage.layer
    FROM school_art 
    JOIN baseimage ON baseimage.base_folder = school_art.series_code 
    WHERE baseimage.image_type = 'B' ORDER BY school_art.id 

ELSE

 INSERT INTO set_colors (school_art_id, baseimage_id, sub_folder, layer)

@TITLE:Composite Key Dictionary
@CONTENT:I have some objects in List, let's say List<MyClass> and MyClass has several properties. I would like to create an index of the list based on 3 properties of of MyClass. In this case 2 of the properties are int's, and one property is a datetime. Basically I would like to be able to do something like: Dictionary< CompositeKey , MyClass > MyClassListIndex = Dictionary< CompositeKey , MyClass >();
//Populate dictionary with items from the List<MyClass> MyClassList
MyClass aMyClass = Dicitonary[(keyTripletHere)];
 I sometimes create multiple dictionaries on a list to index different properties of the classes it holds. I am not sure how best to handle composite keys though. I considered doing a checksum of the three values but this runs the risk of collisions.

@TITLE:Subversion: ignore modifications to a file locally on one client only
@CONTENT:Is it possible to ignore changes to a file in subversion locally on one client only, without propagating the ignore to the whole repository? The particular problem I'm dealing with is that I've checked out a project and modified a bunch of files including the Makefile, which is already part of the repository. Now the environment I'm working on is different from the rest of the group, and I want the changes to the Makefiles to remain local on my machine and not be committed. However, I don't want to set svn:ignore because that I believe would commit the ignore to the repository, while it is important to keep the make file there.

Up front, I'll say that I've already solved this, in my own way, but I feel something in the Android build system (perhaps regarding Eclipse) is broke, and I hope to save someone else hours of pain. Perhaps others have come across this issue and can comment on what worked for them. For a while, I've had an Android project with some JNI code that I developed using the NDK. Then, today, I changed something in the java code and then poof, I could no longer load my JNI library. It failed with an exception like: E/AndroidRuntime( 999): java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Couldn't load mylibrary: findLibrary returned null I googled and tried everything (rebuilding, close and relaunch Eclipse, etc, etc) What finally fixed my problem? I physically uninstalled my app from the device before trying another run. That's it. After that, it worked. What worked for you?

@TITLE:Visual Studio 2010: very slow web applications debugging!
@CONTENT:I recently installed Visual Studio 2010 (Ultimate edition, final version released in April), and found that debugging a web application became very slow (2-3 times slower than in Visual Studio 2008)! I took the same web application and checked the speed of loading of one of its pages in VS 2008 and VS 2010, and compared the time it takes to load the page. I tested it using 2 approaches: 1) debugging under ASP.NET Development Server (by pressing the "Start" button) and 2) using ASP.NET Development Server without debugging (by using the "View in Browser" menu command). And I got the following results for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010. 1) ASP.NET Development Server withoud debugging ("View in Browser"): the speed of page loading is the same in VS 2008 and 2010. 2) Debugging under ASP.NET Development Server ("Start" button): in VS 2010 the page takes more time to load than in VS 2008 - VS 2010 debugging is 2-3 times slower than in VS 2008! 3) At the same time, when debugging a web application in VS 2008, it takes the same time to load the page compared to when using only the "View in Browser" command. That is, VS 2008 debugging does not introduce any overhead to page loading in the web browser! I wanted to make sure that other people have the same problem with slow debugging of web applications in VS 2010. Can this issue be solved by any means? BTW, I am using Windows XP SP3. Thank you.

@TITLE:Date difference in Javascript (ignoring time of day)
@CONTENT:I'm writing an equipment rental application where clients are charged a fee for renting equipment based on the duration (in days) of the rental. So, basically, (daily fee * number of days) = total charge. For instant feedback on the client side, I'm trying to use Javascript to figure out the difference in two calendar dates. I've searched around, but nothing I've found is quite what I'm looking for. Most solutions I've seen are of the form: function dateDiff1(startDate, endDate) {
    return ((endDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime()) / 1000*60*60*24);
}
 My problem is that equipment can be checked out and returned at any time of day during those two dates with no additional charge. The above code is calculating the number of 24 hour periods between the two dates, when I'm really interested in the number of calendar days. For example, if someone checked out equipment at 6am on July 6th and returned it at 10pm on July 7th, the above code would calculate that more than one 24 hour period had passed, and would return 2. The desired result is 1, since only one calendar date has elapsed (i.e. the 6th to the 7th). The closest solution I've found is this function: function dateDiff2(startDate, endDate) {
    return endDate.getDate() - startDate.getDate();
}
 which does exactly what I want, as long as the two dates are within the same month. However, since getDate() only returns the day of month (i.e. 1-31), it doesn't work when the dates span multiple months (e.g. July 31 to August 1 is 1 day, but the above calcuates 1 - 31, or -29). On the backend, in PHP, I'm using gregoriantojd(), which seems to work just fine (see this post for an example). I just can't find an equivalent solution in Javascript. Anyone have any ideas?
@CODE:function dateDiff1(startDate, endDate) {
    return ((endDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime()) / 1000*60*60*24);
} function dateDiff2(startDate, endDate) {
    return endDate.getDate() - startDate.getDate();
} diff = Math.max(1, diff)

@TITLE:Running an asynchronous operation triggered by an ASP.NET web page request
@CONTENT:I have an asynchronous operation that for various reasons needs to be triggered using an HTTP call to an ASP.NET web page. When my page is requested, it should start this operation and immediately return an acknowledgment to the client. This method is also exposed via a WCF web service, and it works perfectly. On my first attempt, an exception was thrown, telling me: Asynchronous operations are not allowed in this context.
Page starting an asynchronous operation has to have the Async
attribute set to true and an asynchronous operation can only be
started on a page prior to PreRenderComplete event. So of course I added the Async="true" parameter to the @Page directive. Now, I'm not getting an error, but the page is blocking until the Asynchronous operation completes. How do I get a true fire-and-forget page working? Edit: Some code for more info. It's a bit more complicated than this, but I've tried to get the general idea in there. public partial class SendMessagePage : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

        sender.Start();

    }

@TITLE:Date difference in Javascript (ignoring time of day)
@CONTENT:I'm writing an equipment rental application where clients are charged a fee for renting equipment based on the duration (in days) of the rental. So, basically, (daily fee * number of days) = total charge. For instant feedback on the client side, I'm trying to use Javascript to figure out the difference in two calendar dates. I've searched around, but nothing I've found is quite what I'm looking for. Most solutions I've seen are of the form: function dateDiff1(startDate, endDate) {
    return ((endDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime()) / 1000*60*60*24);
}
 My problem is that equipment can be checked out and returned at any time of day during those two dates with no additional charge. The above code is calculating the number of 24 hour periods between the two dates, when I'm really interested in the number of calendar days. For example, if someone checked out equipment at 6am on July 6th and returned it at 10pm on July 7th, the above code would calculate that more than one 24 hour period had passed, and would return 2. The desired result is 1, since only one calendar date has elapsed (i.e. the 6th to the 7th). The closest solution I've found is this function: function dateDiff2(startDate, endDate) {
    return endDate.getDate() - startDate.getDate();
}
 which does exactly what I want, as long as the two dates are within the same month. However, since getDate() only returns the day of month (i.e. 1-31), it doesn't work when the dates span multiple months (e.g. July 31 to August 1 is 1 day, but the above calcuates 1 - 31, or -29). On the backend, in PHP, I'm using gregoriantojd(), which seems to work just fine (see this post for an example). I just can't find an equivalent solution in Javascript. Anyone have any ideas?
@CODE:function dateDiff1(startDate, endDate) {
    return ((endDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime()) / 1000*60*60*24);
} function dateDiff2(startDate, endDate) {
    return endDate.getDate() - startDate.getDate();

@TITLE:Running an asynchronous operation triggered by an ASP.NET web page request
@CONTENT:I have an asynchronous operation that for various reasons needs to be triggered using an HTTP call to an ASP.NET web page. When my page is requested, it should start this operation and immediately return an acknowledgment to the client. This method is also exposed via a WCF web service, and it works perfectly. On my first attempt, an exception was thrown, telling me: Asynchronous operations are not allowed in this context.
Page starting an asynchronous operation has to have the Async
attribute set to true and an asynchronous operation can only be
started on a page prior to PreRenderComplete event. So of course I added the Async="true" parameter to the @Page directive. Now, I'm not getting an error, but the page is blocking until the Asynchronous operation completes. How do I get a true fire-and-forget page working? Edit: Some code for more info. It's a bit more complicated than this, but I've tried to get the general idea in there. public partial class SendMessagePage : System.Web.UI.Page

@TITLE:Is it better to use System.arraycopy(K) than a for loop for copying arrays?
@CONTENT:I want to create a new array of objects putting together two smaller arrays. They can't be null, but size may be 0. I can't chose between these two ways: are they equivalent or is one more efficient (for example system.arraycopy() copies whole chunks)? MyObject[] things = new MyObject[publicThings.length+privateThings.length];
System.arraycopy(publicThings, 0, talks, 0, publicThings.length);
System.arraycopy(privateThings, 0, talks,  publicThings.length, privateThings.length);
 or MyObject[] things = new MyObject[publicThings.length+privateThings.length];
for (int i = 0; i < things.length; i++) {

    } else {
        things[i] = privateThings[i-publicThings.length]        
    }
}
 Is the only difference the look of the code? EDIT: thanks for linked question, but they seem to have an unsolved discussion: Is it truly faster if it is not for native types: byte[], Object[], char[]? in all other cases, a type check is executed, which would be my case and so would be equivalent... no? On another linked question, they say that the size matters a lot, for size >24 system.arraycopy() wins, for smaller than 10, manual for loop is better... Now I'm really confused.
@CODE:MyObject[] things = new MyObject[publicThings.length+privateThings.length];
System.arraycopy(publicThings, 0, talks, 0, publicThings.length);
System.arraycopy(privateThings, 0, talks,  publicThings.length, privateThings.length); MyObject[] things = new MyObject[publicThings.length+privateThings.length];

@TITLE:Android Application Class Lifecycle
@CONTENT:The android app I am working on overrides the Application class to store lightweight state (username, gps location, etc) in static vars. Most of this state is set in OnCreate of the launch activity (username retrieved from prefs, location listener runs). Is it safe to rely on the launch activity to initialize the Application class? Are there any cases where the Application class might be re-created without the Launch activity also being created? The question comes up because I ran into a null pointer exception accessing a variable in the Application class on resuming the app after the phone was asleep for several hours (the app was left in the foreground before phone went to sleep). Is it possible that the process was killed while the phone was asleep and on waking the phone, the Application class was re-created, the top activity in the stack was resumed, but the launch activity.onCreate wasn't run thus the Application class wasn't initialized? Note that I have tried to test these kinds of scenarios by Forcing the App to stop using Settings / Manage applications. However, I'm not able to recreate the problem. On the next run, the Application class is created, followed by the launch activity.onCreate. Is it safe to assume that the Application class instance will exist as long as the process, and that when the Application class is created it is equivalent to "restarting" the application ie. start with a new activity stack (and first activity on stack is the launch activity)?

@CONTENT:Seems like this would be a common question, though I could not find it on SO. Which version of MSXML should I use in my applications, and more importantly, how should I decide? There is MSXML3, 4, 5 and 6. I recently posted some code in calling-wcf-service-by-vbscript that used MSXML v4. AnthonyWJones posted that I shouldn't use 4, but instead 3 or 6, but probably 3. Certainly not v5! Why? I'd like to know more about the criteria for selecting the version of MSXML to use in my apps. Bonus question: Does anyone have a summary of the differences between the various versions of MSXML over time? Summary so far: MSXML6 Should be first choice. was released in 2006, and includes perf and compliance fixes. Use this if you can. It's good. There are no merge modules; to bundle the MSXML6 runtime with your app, MS suggests packaging the MSXML6 msi file. MSXML6 is an upgrade from MSXML3/4 but does not replace them, because it discontinues some features. You can get the MSI here. MSXML3 Second choice. Most widely deployed version. Originally shipped in March 2000. Actively maintained, no new features. Currently supported, if you are on SP5 (shipped in 2005) or later. SP7 is current (also from 2005). MSXML5 was released only as part of MS-Office. Currently supported by Microsoft, but only as part of Office, not for building apps. Don't build apps that depend on MSXML5: Verboten. MSXML4 originally shipped? Currently in "maintenance mode". Microsoft is encouraging people to move off MSXML4 to MSXML6. Currently supported if you are on MSXML4SP2 or later, which shipped in 2003. download MSXML4SP2 here. Can be redisributed. Using the right version of MSXML in Internet Explorer is a good entry on the blog from Microsoft's xmlteam.

@CONTENT:I have a site with many pages, the pages have different background pictures, and i display them from CSS like: body.page-8 {
background: url("../img/pic.jpg") no-repeat scroll center top #000;
background-size: cover;
}
 naturally this shows the background image with the new css3 'cover' and everything is fine. My problem: I haveto show diffrent (fullscreen) pictures on one page using img elements, and i want them to have the same properties as the css3 'cover' propery. (the images cant be displayed from css, they must be displayed from the html document) Normally i use: div.mydiv img {
width: 100%;
}
 Or: div.mydiv img {
width: auto;
}
 to make the picture full and responsive. Hovever the picture shrinks to much (width: 100%) when the screen is getting more narrow, and shows the body background color in the bottomscreen. The other method width: auto; only makes the image fullsize and does not repond to the screen size. Could i implement a way to display the image the same way as the background-size: cover does? Or maybe wait for HTML6? :) Thnx Community!
@CODE:body.page-8 {
background: url("../img/pic.jpg") no-repeat scroll center top #000;
background-size: cover;
} img div.mydiv img {
width: 100%;
} div.mydiv img {

@TITLE:Big O of JavaScript arrays
@CONTENT:Arrays in JavaScript are very easy to modify by adding and removing items. It somewhat masks the fact that most languages array's are fixed-size, and require complex operations to resize. It seems that JavaScript makes it easy to write poorly performing array code. This leads to the question: What performance (in terms of big O time complexity) can I expect from JavaScript implementations in regards to array performance? I assume that all reasonable JavaScript implementations have at least the following big O's. Access - O(1) Appending - O(n) Prepending - O(n) Insertion - O(n) Deletion - O(n) Swapping - O(1) JavaScript lets you pre-fill an array to a certain size, using new Array(length) syntax. (Bonus question: Is creating an array in this manner O(1) or O(n)) This is more like a conventional array, and if used as a pre-sized array, can allow O(1) appending. If circular buffer logic is added, you can achieve O(1) prepending. If a dynamically expanding array is used, O(log n) will be the average case for both of those. Can I expect better performance for some things than my assumptions here? I don't expect anything is outlined in any specifications, but in practice it could be that all major implementations use optimized arrays behind the scenes. Are there dynamically expanding arrays or some other performance boosting algorithms at work? P.S. The reason I'm wondering this is because I'm researching some sorting algorithms, most of which seem to assume appending and deleting are O(1) operations when describing their overall big O.

chgrp -R commongroup /home
 or equivalently umask 0002. But running the above commands only fixes the current files in the folders and umask only works for single users and has to be run every time a user logs in ie. in the .bashrc file (and will this work for changes mode via gnome?). Is there a system wide command or setting that I could use to make sure that our commongroup has write access to the common files?

@CONTENT:Im developing a REST API service for a large social networking website Im involved in. So far, its working great. I can issue GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to object URLs and affect my data. However, this data is paged (limited to 30 results at a time). However, what would be the best RESTful way to get the total number of say, members, via my API? Currently, I issue requests to a URL structure like the following: /api/membersXReturns a list of members (30 at a time as mentioned above) /api/members/1XAffects a single member, depending on request method used My question is: how would I then use a similar URL structure to get the total number of members in my application? Obviously requesting just the id field (similar to Facebooks Graph API) and counting the results would be ineffective given only a slice of 30 results would only be returned.

@CONTENT:I was 'forced' to add myLocalVar = null; statement into finally clause just before leaving method. Reason is to help GC. I was told I will get SMS's during night when server crashes next time, so I better did it :-). I think this is pointless, as myLocalVar is scoped to method, and will be 'lost' as soon as method exits. Extra nulling just pollutes the code, but is harmless otherwise. My question is, where does this myth about helping GC come from? (I was referred to "Java memory books") Do you know any article from 'authorities' which explain it in more depth? Is there possibility this is not a myth, but really helps somehow? If so, how? May nulling local variables cause any harm? To clarify, method look like this: void method() {
  MyClass myLocalVar = null;
  try {
    myLocalVar = get reference to object;
    ... do more here ...

@TITLE:The context of this in Meteor template event handlers (using Handlebars for templating)
@CONTENT:A quick question on the context of the event handlers for templates in Meteor (with Handlebars). In the section of Documentation on template instances (http://docs.meteor.com/#template_inst) it is mentioned that "Template instance objects are found as the value of this in the created, rendered, and destroyed template callbacks and as an argument to event handlers" In the Templates section (http://docs.meteor.com/#templates) it says "Finally, you can use an events declaration on a template function to set up a table of event handlers. The format is documented at Event Maps. The this argument to the event handler will be the data context of the element that triggered the event." Well, this is only partially true. Let's use an example from the docs: <template name="scores">
  {{#each player}}
    {{> playerScore}}
  {{/each}}
</template>

<template name="playerScore">
  <div>{{name}}: {{score}}
    <span class="givePoints">Give points</span>
  </div>
</template
Template.playerScore.events({
  'click .givePoints': function () {
    Users.update({_id: this._id}, {$inc: {score: 2}});
  });
 Here the "this" context of the 'click .givePoints' event handler is indeed the template instance of playerScore. Let's modify the html: <template name="scores">
  <span class="click-me">Y U NO click me?<span>
  {{#each player}}
    {{> playerScore}}
  {{/each}}
</template>

<template name="playerScore">
  <div>{{name}}: {{score}}
    <span class="givePoints">Give points</span>
  </div>
</template>
 ... and add an event handler for .click-me on the scores template: Template.scores.events({
  'click .click-me': function () {
    console.log(this);
  }
});
 Now, if you click the span, what do you get logged? The Window object! What did I expect to get? The template object! Or maybe the data context, but it's neither. However, inside the callbacks (e.g. Template.scores.rendered = function(){ ... }) the context of "this" is always the template instance. I guess my real question would be: is this something to do with a bug in Handlebars, Meteor or somewhere in between? slightly incomplete documentation on the templates? me completely misinterpreting the docs or not understanding something fundamental about Meteor or Handlebars? Thanks!

@TITLE:DataTables fixed headers misaligned with columns in wide tables
@CONTENT:Problem When using the sScrollX, sScrollXInner and/or sScrollY to achieve a fixed header table with its inner content scrolling, the headers of the table go out of alignment with the rest of the body in Chrome and IE. Firefox on the other hand displays them perfectly. Using the version 1.9.4, as far as I can tell, this issue only occurs when there is a lot of data with fluctuating widths, and with words that are very long/unwrappable combined in the same columns as small ones. Also the table in question needs to be fairly wide. All these factors are demonstrated in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pratik136/etL73/12/embedded/result/ Output Chrome: IE: Firefox Suggested Solutions These solutions have been suggested before but have had no effect on my implementation. Owing to some of these suggestions, I setup a clean plain vanilla demo as I wanted to ensure that no other code was contributing to this effect. turn-off/remove all my css setTimeout( function () { oTable.fnAdjustColumnSizing(); }, 10 ); calling oTable.fnFilter( "x",0 ) and oTable.fnFilter( "",0 ) in that order "sScrollXInner": "100%" get rid of all widths The only solution that I found to the misaligned headers was taking out sScrollX and sScrollY, but this can't be counted as a solution as you lose the fixed header/inner content scrolling functionality. So sadly it's a temporary hack, not a fix! Note To edit/play with the latest fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pratik136/etL73/12 I have tried various combinations which can be observed in the revision history of the fiddle by using the link http://jsfiddle.net/pratik136/etL73/#REV# where 1 <= #REV# <=12 History StackO This question has been asked before: jQuery Datatables Header Misaligned With Vertical Scrolling but the vital difference is that the OP of that question mentioned that they were able to fix the issue if all CSS was removed, which is untrue in my case, and I have tried a few permutations, thus thought the question worthy of a repost.

@TITLE:Dealing with line Breaks on contentEditable DIV
@CONTENT:I have a problem with contenteditable line breaks on SAFARI/CHROME. When I press "return" on a contentEditable <div>, instead of creating a <br> (like Firefox), they create a new <div>: <div>Something</div>
<div>Something</div>
 That looks like (on the contentEditable DIV): Something
Something
 But after sanitization (removing <div>), I get this: SomethingSomething
 In Firefox, the contenteditable is: Something
<br>
Something
 And that after sanitization looks the same: Something
Something
 Is there any solution to "normalize" this across browsers? I've found this code on Make a <br> instead of <div></div> by pressing Enter on a contenteditable $(function(){

  $("#editable")

  // make sure br is always the lastChild of contenteditable
  .live("keyup mouseup", function(){
    if (!this.lastChild || this.lastChild.nodeName.toLowerCase() != "br") {
      this.appendChild(document.createChild("br"));
     }
  })

  // use br instead of div div
  .live("keypress", function(e){
    if (e.which == 13) {
      if (window.getSelection) {
        var selection = window.getSelection(),
          range = selection.getRangeAt(0),
          br = document.createElement("br");
        range.deleteContents();
        range.insertNode(br);
        range.setStartAfter(br);
        range.setEndAfter(br);
        range.collapse(false);
        selection.removeAllRanges();
        selection.addRange(range);
        return false;
      }
    }
  });
});
 This works, but (in SAFARI and CHROME) I have to press two times the "return" key to get a new line... Any idea? Edit: With the code I found ( at the bottom of this question) is working fine except the function that "makes sure a <br> element is always the lastChild... Any idea on how to fix this? Edit 2: I'm getting this error on the console: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'createChild' Edit 3: Ok, I changed the document.createChild("br"); to document.createElement("br"); and I think I got it working in FF/Safari/Chrome... All return <br> for new lines... The problem is now that when I'm inside an Ordered or Unordered List, I need to get a new line without <br>... Edit 4: If anyone interested in the solution of the last edit: Avoid createElement function if it's inside a <LI> element (contentEditable)
@CODE:contenteditable <div> <br> <div> <div>Something</div>
<div>Something</div> Something
Something <div> SomethingSomething contenteditable Something
<br>
Something Something
Something $(function(){

  $("#editable")

  // make sure br is always the lastChild of contenteditable
  .live("keyup mouseup", function(){
    if (!this.lastChild || this.lastChild.nodeName.toLowerCase() != "br") {
      this.appendChild(document.createChild("br"));
     }
  })

  // use br instead of div div
  .live("keypress", function(e){
    if (e.which == 13) {
      if (window.getSelection) {
        var selection = window.getSelection(),
          range = selection.getRangeAt(0),
          br = document.createElement("br");
        range.deleteContents();
        range.insertNode(br);
        range.setStartAfter(br);
        range.setEndAfter(br);
        range.collapse(false);
        selection.removeAllRanges();

        return false;
      }
    }
  });

@LINK:/questions/2633834/should-java-try-blocks-be-scoped-as-tightly-as-possible
@TITLE:Should java try blocks be scoped as tightly as possible?
@CONTENT:I've been told that there is some overhead in using the Java try-catch mechanism. So, while it is necessary to put methods that throw checked exception within a try block to handle the possible exception, it is good practice performance-wise to limit the size of the try block to contain only those operations that could throw exceptions. I'm not so sure that this is a sensible conclusion. Consider the two implementations below of a function that processes a specified text file. Even if it is true that the first one incurs some unnecessary overhead, I find it much easier to follow. It is less clear where exactly the exceptions come from just from looking at statements, but the comments clearly show which statements are responsible. The second one is much longer and complicated than the first. In particular, the nice line-reading idiom of the first has to be mangled to fit the readLine call into a try block. What is the best practice for handling exceptions in a funcion where multiple exceptions could be thrown in its definition? This one contains all the processing code within the try block: void processFile(File f)
{
  try
  {
    // construction of FileReader can throw FileNotFoundException
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(f));

    // call of readLine can throw IOException
    String line;
    while ((line = in.readLine()) != null)
    {
      process(line);
    }
  }
  catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
  {
    handle(ex);
  }
  catch (IOException ex)
  {
    handle(ex);
  }
}

@LINK:/questions/125359/any-clever-ways-of-handling-the-context-in-a-web-app
@TITLE:Any clever ways of handling the context in a web app?
@CONTENT:In Java, web apps are bundled in to WARs. By default, many servlet containers will use the WAR name as the context name for the application. Thus myapp.war gets deployed to http://example.com/myapp. The problem is that the webapp considers its "root" to be, well, "root", or simply "/", whereas HTML would consider the root of your application to be "/myapp". The Servlet API and JSP have facilities to help manage this. For example, if, in a servlet, you do: response.sendRedirect("/mypage.jsp"), the container will prepend the context and create the url: http://example.com/myapp/mypage.jsp". However, you can't do that with, say, the IMG tag in HTML. If you do <img src="/myimage.gif"/> you will likely get a 404, because what you really wanted was "/myapp/myimage.gif". Many frameworks have JSP tags that are context aware as well, and there are different ways of making correct URLs within JSP (none particularly elegantly). It's a nitty problem for coders to jump in an out of when to use an "App Relative" url, vs an absolute url. Finally, there's the issue of Javascript code that needs to create URLs on the fly, and embedded URLs within CSS (for background images and the like). I'm curious what techniques others use to mitigate and work around this issue. Many simply punt and hard code it, either to server root or to whatever context they happen to be using. I already know that answer, that's not what I'm looking for. What do you do?

@TITLE:What does it mean to bind a multicast (UDP) socket?
@CONTENT:I am using multicast UDP between hosts that have multiple network interfaces. I am using boost::asio, and am confused by the 2 operations receivers have to make: bind, then join-group. Why do you need to specify the local address of an interface, during bind, when you do that with every multicast group that you join? The sister-question regards the multicast port: Since during sending, you send to a multicast address & port, why, during subscription to a multicast group, you only specify the address, not the port - the port being specified in the confusing call to bind. Note: the "join-group" is a wrapper over setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP), which as documented, may be called multiple times on the same socket to subscribe to different groups (over different networks?). It would therefore make perfect sense to ditch the bind call and specify the port every time I subscribe to a group. From what I see, always binding to "0.0.0.0" and specifying the interface address when joining the group, works very well. Confused.

@TITLE:Defining categories for protocols in Objective-C?
@CONTENT:In Objective-C, I can add methods to existing classes with a category, e.g. @interface NSString (MyCategory)
- (BOOL) startsWith: (NSString*) prefix;
@end
 Is it also possible to do this with protocols, i.e. if there was a NSString protocol, something like: @interface <NSString> (MyCategory)
- (BOOL) startsWith: (NSString*) prefix;
@end
 I want to do this since I have several extensions to NSObject (the class), using only public NSObject methods, and I want those extensions also to work with objects implementing the protocol . To give a further example, what if I want to write a method logDescription that prints an object's description to the log: - (void) logDescription {
    NSLog(@"%@", [self description]);
}
 I can of course add this method to NSObject, but there are other classes that do not inherit from NSObject, where I'd also like to have this method, e.g. NSProxy. Since the method only uses public members of protocol , it would be best to add it to the protocol. Edit: Java 8 now has this with "virtual extension methods" in interfaces: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/Defender%20Methods%20v4.pdf. This is exactly what I would like to do in Objective-C. I did not see this question earning this much attention... Regards, Jochen

@TITLE:In 3 minutes, What is Reflection?
@CONTENT:Many .Net interview question lists (including the good ones) contain the question: "What is Reflection?". I was recently asked to answer this in the context of a 5 question, technical test designed to be completed in 15 minutes on a sheet of blank paper handed to me in a cafeteria. My answer went along the lines of "Reflection allows you to discover the Methods, Properties and Fields of any object at runtime". In retrospect, my answer explains how you can use reflection, but it does not explain what reflection is. In my view, my answer was sufficient to convey that I understand what reflection is for but didn't go so far as to explain what reflection is. So please, in the context of .Net, in your own concise words, define what Reflection is. Don't spend more than three minutes answering. Don't refer to the .Net documentation, we've all seen it.

@LINK:/questions/248222/method-overloading-can-you-overuse-it
@TITLE:Method Overloading. Can you overuse it?
@CONTENT:What's better practice when defining several methods that return the same shape of data with different filters? Explicit method names or overloaded methods? For example. If I have some Products and I'm pulling from a database explicit way: public List<Product> GetProduct(int productId) {    // return a List    }
public List<Product> GetProductByCategory(Category category) {    // return a List    }
public List<Product> GetProductByName(string Name ) {    // return a List    }
 overloaded way: public List<Product> GetProducts() {    // return a List of all products    }
public List<Product> GetProducts(Category category) { // return a List by Category }
public List<Product> GetProducts(string searchString ) { // return a List by search string }
 I realize you may get into a problem with similar signatures, but if you're passing objects instead of base types (string, int, char, DateTime, etc) this will be less of an issue. So... is it a good idea to overload a method to reduce the number of methods you have and for clarity, or should each method that filters the data a different way have a different method name?
@CODE:public List<Product> GetProduct(int productId) {    // return a List    }
public List<Product> GetProductByCategory(Category category) {    // return a List    }
public List<Product> GetProductByName(string Name ) {    // return a List    } public List<Product> GetProducts() {    // return a List of all products    }
public List<Product> GetProducts(Category category) { // return a List by Category }
public List<Product> GetProducts(string searchString ) { // return a List by search string }

@CONTENT:I have a VideoView that takes up the top half of the Activity in portrait orientation with the bottom half of the screen showing some images and text. I am playing a rtsp video stream in the video view when the Activity starts. I have attached a MediaController to the VideoView via the following code:     MediaController controller = new MediaController(this);
    controller.setAnchorView(this.videoView);
    controller.setMediaPlayer(this.videoView);
    this.videoView.setMediaController(controller);
 When I tap the VideoView to bring up the MediaController on the screen I expected the playback controls to appear overlaying the bottom area of the VideoView (the bottom of the MediaController even with the bottom of the VideoView). Instead the MediaController pops up lower down on the screen, overlaying some of the graphics and text I have below the VideoView. Are there some additional steps I need to take to get the MediaController to appear where I want it to on the screen?

@LINK:/questions/3470447/can-i-use-a-list-as-a-hash-in-r-if-so-why-is-it-so-slow
@TITLE:Can I use a list as a hash in R? If so, why is it so slow?
@CONTENT:Before using R, I used quite a bit of Perl. In Perl, I would often use hashes, and lookups of hashes are generally regarded as fast in Perl. For example, the following code will populate a hash with up to 10000 key/value pairs, where the keys are random letters and the values are random integers. Then, it does 10000 random lookups in that hash. #!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

my @letters = ('a'..'z');

print @letters . "\n";
my %testHash;

for(my $i = 0; $i < 10000; $i++) {
    my $r1 = int(rand(26));
    my $r2 = int(rand(26));
    my $r3 = int(rand(26));
    my $key = $letters[$r1] . $letters[$r2] . $letters[$r3];
    my $value = int(rand(1000));
    $testHash{$key} = $value;
}

my @keyArray = keys(%testHash);
my $keyLen = scalar @keyArray;

for(my $j = 0; $j < 10000; $j++) {
    my $key = $keyArray[int(rand($keyLen))];
    my $lookupValue = $testHash{$key};
    print "key " .  $key . " Lookup $lookupValue \n";
}
 Now that increasingly, I am wanting to have a hash-like data structure in R. The following is the equivalent R code: testHash <- list()

for(i in 1:10000) {
  key.tmp = paste(letters[floor(26*runif(3))], sep="")
  key <- capture.output(cat(key.tmp, sep=""))
  value <- floor(1000*runif(1))
  testHash[[key]] <- value
}

keyArray <- attributes(testHash)$names
keyLen = length(keyArray);

for(j in 1:10000) {
  key <- keyArray[floor(keyLen*runif(1))]
  lookupValue = testHash[[key]]
  print(paste("key", key, "Lookup", lookupValue))
}
 The code seem to be doing equivalent things. However, the Perl one is much faster: >time ./perlHashTest.pl
real    0m4.346s
user    **0m0.110s**
sys 0m0.100s
 Comparing to R: time R CMD BATCH RHashTest.R

real    0m8.210s
user    **0m7.630s**
sys 0m0.200s
 What explains the discrepancy? Are lookups in R lists just not good? Increasing to 100,000 list length and 100,000 lookups only exaggerates the discrepancy? Is there a better alternative for the hash data structure in R than the native list()?

@CONTENT:I'd love to write a plugin to monitor my Spam folder in Gmail, and perform various functions (like delete anything with the word Pfizer in it!). I have a bunch of other ideas too for our Google Apps domain. So, is there a Gmail API? Ideally I'd have a web service could connect to my Gmail server, with the correct authentication, and have access to my data allowing me to Create/Read/Upadte/Delete Gmail messages. I couldn't see anything obvious that gave me the access I wanted, so hopefully someone here knows how. Cheers, Shane p.s. I can code any any language you like, so please don't worry about which language makes sense.

@CONTENT:inside my controller, I would like to filter an array of objects. each of these objects is a map which can contain strings as well as lists I tried using $filter('filter')(array, function) format but I do not know how to access the individual elements of the array inside my function ..here is a snippet to show what I want. $filter('filter')(array, function(){ return criteriaMatch(item, criteria); });
 and then in the criteriaMatch function, I will check if each of the individual property matches var criteriaMatch = function(item, criteria){
  // go thro each individual property in the item and criteria
  // and check if they are equal
}
 I have to do all these in the controller and compile a list of lists and set them in the scope. so i do need to access the $filter('filter') this way only. all the examples i found in the net so far have static criteria searches inside the function, they dont pass a criteria object and test against each item in the array. thx s

@TITLE:Why are private virtual methods illegal in C#?
@CONTENT:Coming from a C++ background, this came as a surprise to me. In C++ it's good practice to make virtual functions private. From http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm: "Guideline #2: Prefer to make virtual functions private." I also quote Eric Lippert's blog, from Knights-knaves-protected-and-internal: Private virtual methods are illegal in C#, which irks me to no end. I would totally use that feature if we had it. I understand that in C#, you wouldn't be able to override a private virtual method in a derived (but not nested) class. Why is this the case? In C++ the access specifier has nothing to do with whether you can override a function or not.

@LINK:/questions/2170484/shouldnt-we-use-noscript-tag
@TITLE:Shouldn't we use <noscript> tag?
@CONTENT:I found some good cons here: The noscript tag only detects whether the browser has JavaScript enabled or not. If JavaScript is disabled in the Firewall rather than in the browser then the JavaScript will not run and the content of the noscript tag will not be displayed. Many JavaScripts are dependent on a specific feature or features of the language being supported in order for them to be able to run (for example document.getElementById). Where the required features are not supported the JavaScript is unable to run but since JavaScript itself is supported the noscript content will not be displayed. The most useful place to use the noscript tag is in the head of the page where it would be able to selectively determine what stylesheet and meta tags get applied to the page as the page is loading rather than having to wait until the page is loaded. Unfortunately the noscript tag is only valid within the body of the page and so cannot be used in the head. The noscript tag is a block level element and therefore can only be used to display entire blocks of content when JavaScript is disabled. It cannot be used inline. Ideally, web pages should use HTML for the content, CSS for the appearance, and JavaScript for the behaviour. Using the noscript tag is applying a behaviour from within the HTML rather than applying it from JavaScript. Source: http://javascript.about.com/od/reference/a/noscriptnomore.htm I very much agree on last point. Is there a way to make and add an external <noscript> file? Should we place <noscript> in the <head>?

@LINK:/questions/444627/c-sharp-thread-pool-limiting-threads
@TITLE:C# thread pool limiting threads
@CONTENT:Alright...I've given the site a fair search and have read over many posts about this topic. I found this question: Code for a simple thread pool in C# especially helpful. However, as it always seems, what I need varies slightly. I have looked over the MSDN example and adapted it to my needs somewhat. The example I refer to is here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3dasc8as(VS.80,printer).aspx My issue is this. I have a fairly simple set of code that loads a web page via the HttpWebRequest and WebResponse classes and reads the results via a Stream. I fire off this method in a thread as it will need to executed many times. The method itself is pretty short, but the number of times it needs to be fired (with varied data for each time) varies. It can be anywhere from 1 to 200. Everything I've read seems to indicate the ThreadPool class being the prime candidate. Here is what things get tricky. I might need to fire off this thing say 100 times, but I can only have 3 threads at most running (for this particular task). I've tried setting the MaxThreads on the ThreadPool via: ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads( 3, 3 ); I'm not entirely convinced this approach is working. Furthermore, I don't want to clobber other web sites or programs running on the system this will be running on. So, by limiting the # of threads on the ThreadPool, can I be certain that this pertains to my code and my threads only? The msdn example uses the event drive approach and calls WaitHandle.WaitAll( doneEvents );, which is how I'm doing this. So the heart of my question is, how does one ensure or specify a maximum number of threads that can be run for their code, but have the code keep running more threads as the previous ones finish up until some arbitrary point? Am I tackling this the right way? Sincerely, Jason Okay, I've added a semaphore approach and completely removed the threadpool code. It seems simple enough. I got my info from: http://www.albahari.com/threading/part2.aspx It's this example that showed me how: [text below here is a copy/paste from the site] A Semaphore with a capacity of one is similar to a Mutex or lock, except that the Semaphore has no "owner" V it's thread-agnostic. Any thread can call Release on a Semaphore, while with Mutex and lock, only the thread that obtained the resource can release it. In this following example, ten threads execute a loop with a Sleep statement in the middle. A Semaphore ensures that not more than three threads can execute that Sleep statement at once: class SemaphoreTest {

  static Semaphore s = new Semaphore (3, 3);  // Available=3; Capacity=3



  static void Main() {

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) new Thread (Go).Start();

  }



  static void Go() {

    while (true) {

      s.WaitOne();

      Thread.Sleep (100);   // Only 3 threads can get here at once

      s.Release();

    }

  }

}
@CODE:class SemaphoreTest {

  static Semaphore s = new Semaphore (3, 3);  // Available=3; Capacity=3



  static void Main() {

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) new Thread (Go).Start();

  }



  static void Go() {

    while (true) {

      s.WaitOne();

      Thread.Sleep (100);   // Only 3 threads can get here at once

      s.Release();

@LINK:/questions/388677/can-you-make-an-alpha-transparent-png-with-c
@TITLE:Can you make an alpha transparent PNG with C#?
@CONTENT:I have a multi-browser page that shows vertical text. As an ugly hack to get text to render vertically in all browsers I've created a custom page handler that returns a PNG with the text drawn vertically. Here's my basic code (C#3, but small changes to any other version down to 1): Font f = GetSystemConfiguredFont();
//this sets the text to be rotated 90deg clockwise (i.e. down)
StringFormat stringFormat = new StringFormat { FormatFlags = StringFormatFlags.DirectionVertical };

SizeF size;
// creates 1Kx1K image buffer and uses it to find out how bit the image needs to be to fit the text
using ( Image imageg = (Image) new Bitmap( 1000, 1000 ) )
    size = Graphics.FromImage( imageg ).
    	MeasureString( text, f, 25, stringFormat );

using ( Bitmap image = new Bitmap( (int) size.Width, (int) size.Height ) )
{
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage( (Image) image );
    g.FillRectangle( Brushes.White, 0f, 0f, image.Width, image.Height );
    g.TranslateTransform( image.Width, image.Height );
    g.RotateTransform( 180.0F ); //note that we need the rotation as the default is down

    // draw text
    g.DrawString( text, f, Brushes.Black, 0f, 0f, stringFormat );

    //make be background transparent - this will be an index (rather than an alpha) transparency
    image.MakeTransparent( Color.White );

    //note that this image has to be a PNG, as GDI+'s gif handling renders any transparency as black.
    context.Response.AddHeader( "ContentType", "image/png" );
    using ( MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream() )
    {
    	image.Save( memStream, ImageFormat.Png );
    	memStream.WriteTo( context.Response.OutputStream );
    }
}
 This creates an image that looks how I want it to, except that the transparency is index based. As I'm returning a PNG it could support a proper alpha transparency. Is there any way to do this in .net? Thanks to Vlix (see comments) I've made some changes, though it still isn't right: using ( Bitmap image = new Bitmap( (int) size.Width, (int) size.Height, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb ) )
{
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage( (Image) image );
    g.TranslateTransform( image.Width, image.Height );
    g.RotateTransform( 180.0F ); //note that we need the rotation as the default is down

    // draw text
    g.DrawString( text, f, Brushes.Black, 0f, 0f, stringFormat );

    //note that this image has to be a PNG, as GDI+'s gif handling renders any transparency as black.
    context.Response.AddHeader( "ContentType", "image/png" );
    using ( MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream() )
    {
    	//note that context.Response.OutputStream doesn't support the Save, but does support WriteTo
    	image.Save( memStream, ImageFormat.Png );
    	memStream.WriteTo( context.Response.OutputStream );
    }
}
 Now the alpha appears to work, but the text appears blocky - as if it still has the jaggie edges but against a black background. Is this some bug with .Net/GDI+? I've already found that it fails for even index transparencies for gifs, so I don't have much confidence it it. This image shows the two ways this goes wrong: The top image shows it with no white background or MakeTransparent call. The second with the background filled with white and then MakeTransparent called to add the index transparency. Neither of these is correct - the second image has white aliasing jaggies that I don't want, the first appears to be solidly aliased against black.
@CODE:Font f = GetSystemConfiguredFont();
//this sets the text to be rotated 90deg clockwise (i.e. down)
StringFormat stringFormat = new StringFormat { FormatFlags = StringFormatFlags.DirectionVertical };

SizeF size;
// creates 1Kx1K image buffer and uses it to find out how bit the image needs to be to fit the text
using ( Image imageg = (Image) new Bitmap( 1000, 1000 ) )
    size = Graphics.FromImage( imageg ).
    	MeasureString( text, f, 25, stringFormat );

using ( Bitmap image = new Bitmap( (int) size.Width, (int) size.Height ) )
{
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage( (Image) image );
    g.FillRectangle( Brushes.White, 0f, 0f, image.Width, image.Height );
    g.TranslateTransform( image.Width, image.Height );
    g.RotateTransform( 180.0F ); //note that we need the rotation as the default is down

    // draw text
    g.DrawString( text, f, Brushes.Black, 0f, 0f, stringFormat );

    //make be background transparent - this will be an index (rather than an alpha) transparency
    image.MakeTransparent( Color.White );

    //note that this image has to be a PNG, as GDI+'s gif handling renders any transparency as black.
    context.Response.AddHeader( "ContentType", "image/png" );
    using ( MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream() )
    {
    	image.Save( memStream, ImageFormat.Png );
    	memStream.WriteTo( context.Response.OutputStream );
    }
} using ( Bitmap image = new Bitmap( (int) size.Width, (int) size.Height, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb ) )
{
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage( (Image) image );

 Everything works well with the ajax I'm sending data and receiving a response, my question is as follows: In the SearchCtrl function I have a variable called $scope.result that is later referred to in Index.html. If I insert the html code that contains that variable into the SearchCtrl controller it works fine but if it is in the MainCtrl controller it does not work. How can I share this variable between the controllers. Thanks ahead
@CODE:function MainCntl($scope) {
  ---code
}

function SearchCtrl($scope, $http) {
    $scope.url = 'http://10.0.0.13:9000/processAdHoc';
    $scope.errorM = "No results";     
    $scope.search = function() {

        $http.post($scope.url, { "data" : $scope.keywords}).
        success(function(data, status) {
            $scope.status = status;
            $scope.data = data;
            $scope.result = data; 
            alert('yes');
        })
        .
        error(function(data, status) {
            $scope.data = data || "Request failed";
            $scope.status = status;   
            alert('no');
            $scope.result = "failed";
        });
    };

@TITLE:Rails Active Admin css conflicting with Twitter Bootstrap css
@CONTENT:I'm somewhat new to the Rails asset pipeline so I might be doing something wrong. I'm trying to use Active Admin for my backend and twitter bootstrap css for my front end application. I added the bootstrap.css to /app/assets/stylesheets then also added: //= require bootstrap
 to application.css - then I did a precompile of the assets locally It seems to work fine but some of the styling isn't coming through exactly and I think it's because active admin's css is overriding it. My understanding is that the application compiles the css assets into the application css public asset and the application uses that file when running. I need to somehow separate the two and make it use twitter bootstrap css as the main css on the front end and maybe tell it not to use active admin's css files on the front end. What's the best way to do this?

@TITLE:How can ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC be protected from related domain cookie attacks?
@CONTENT:The related domain cookie attack (more info) allows machines in the same DNS domain to add additional cookies that will also be sent to other computers in the same domain. This can cause issues with authentication, or at worst be a component in a confused deputy attack. Question How can I protect ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC from this type of attack? One possible attack scenario I log into a "secure" web app I get the credentials for my account I trick the user into visiting my site on the same DNS domain I insert the cookie (of my creds) the user goes back to your app. Both cookies (or an overwritten one) is sent to the server User is doing things under my account That is a simplified example, but the idea can be ported other style of attacks, Im just picking the scenario that doesn't seem "too bad". One idea how it can "get bad" is if this was step 1 of a two-step attack. Suppose the user uploaded a bad file that was accessible only in his account; the other user then unwittingly downloads that file, running any executable code that is there. There are a ton of other scenarios that are possible... rather than list them all here I'm trying to figure out how I can protect my server from this type of attack.

@LINK:/questions/9396967/emacs-what-are-good-tactics-for-navigating-directories-and-opening-files
@TITLE:Emacs: what are good tactics for navigating directories and opening files?
@CONTENT:Last week, infuriated (again) by having to cope with different IDEs for R and Perl, neither of which I like or use enough to get really comfortable in, I decided to try Emacs. This decision was not made without a certain trepidation on my part. My main use is for Perl with cperl and for R with ESS. My environment is Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and I am running v23.4.1, which I think is what the ESS package installed on my behalf. Nearly a week in and so far it has been surprisingly painless, no more involved than any other significant piece of software. I have remapped my ctrl key to caps-lock, changed default folders, messed around with .emacs and made some additions such as auto-install, yasnippet, color-theme, icicles and a few others. Clearly there is some very sophisticated stuff out there. In addition of course certain features of base Emacs are immediately very powerful and useful, such as isearching up and down. On the whole I have been pleasantly surprised and reassured. One thing that is cruder than I was expecting is the process of finding and opening files. After a cursory read of various tutorials I had this image of quasi-magical file location and filename auto-completion. The main directories in my setup have paths like g:/roaming/code/perl or g:/roaming/code/R/ but I often need to branch into completely different paths like g:/pricedata/support files/sector/project01/ and so on. Currently I laboriously delete the file path when I need to take a different fork, then use auto-complete to move deeper into that branch of the filesystem. It kinda takes me back to running a bash shell on the Amiga twenty years ago. What had I expected? Something like (using the above example) typing 'project01' to skip immediately into the folder at the bottom of the path. For some reason I had got the idea in my head that Emacs would preload directories. So maybe this wasn't realistic. My guess is that my difficulties probably stem from my own lack of familiarity rather than a structural shortcoming in Emacs and leads on to my questions. I can't complain that there is not enough documentation; rather there is abundant information that it is scattered around rather haphazardly. Icicles has a similar problem - if anything there's too much. 1) What is the best tactic for moving around different branches of the file tree when trying to open files in the minibuffer or using some other method? Are there aliases that can be used to shortcut from one place to another or can one specify directories to be preloaded? Do people just cd around a lot? Or am I coming at this from completely the wrong angle and need to adopt a different strategy? 2) With additional setup, can auto-complete be used to find files in (say) the project01 directly above by prefixing with wildcards etc? What should I focus on to become more efficient here? Am I not tapping the power of add-ons like icicles, anything etc? I realise these questions veer dangerously close the deprecated category of not having clear answers. My defence is that some tips/guidance at this stage before I commit myself to bad habits or a poor long-term solution would be welcome and I suspect the answers will benefit others who might be considering the switch. I am happy to withdraw or rephrase if there are problems.

@LINK:/questions/288954/how-do-i-keep-aspect-ratio-on-scalable-scrollable-content-in-wpf
@TITLE:How do I keep aspect ratio on scalable, scrollable content in WPF?
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to WPF and I've come across a problem that seems a bit tricky to solve. Basically I want a 4x4 grid thats scalable but keeps a square (or any other arbitrary) aspect ratio. This actually seems quite tricky to do, which surprises me because I would imagine its a reasonably common requirement. I start with a Grid definition like this: <Grid>
  <Grid.RowDefinitions>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
  </Grid.RowDefinitions>
  <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
  </Grid.ColumnDefinition>
  ...
</Grid>
 Now if you set that to stretch, it can fill the Window or whatever container you put it in. The rows and column are uniform but the aspect ratio isn't fixed. Then I tried putting it in a StackPanel to use the available space. Didn't help. What did get me most of the way there was when I remembered Viewboxes. <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
  <Viewbox>
    <Grid Height="1000" Width="1000"> <!-- this locks aspect ratio -->
      <Grid.RowDefinitions>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
      </Grid.RowDefinitions>
      <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
      </Grid.ColumnDefinition>
      ...
    </Grid>
  </viewbox>
  <Label HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">Extra Space</Label>
</StackPanel>
 Now my content scales and keeps aspect ratio. The problem is that if the window isn't wide enough some of my grid is off the screen. I'd like to be able to scroll to it if that were the case. Likewise, I might need a minimum size, which might lead to vertical scrolling too. Now I've tried putting my StackPanel and Grid (separately) in an appropriate ScrollViewer container but then the content no longer scales to fit the window. It goes to full size, which is no good. So how do I go about doing this? Am I barking up the wrong tree? Is there a better/easier way of doing this?
@CODE:<Grid>
  <Grid.RowDefinitions>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
    <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
  </Grid.RowDefinitions>
  <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
  </Grid.ColumnDefinition>
  ...
</Grid> <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
  <Viewbox>
    <Grid Height="1000" Width="1000"> <!-- this locks aspect ratio -->
      <Grid.RowDefinitions>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
        <Grid.RowDefinition Height="*"/>
      </Grid.RowDefinitions>
      <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
        <Grid.ColumnDefinition Width="*"/>
      </Grid.ColumnDefinition>
      ...
    </Grid>

@CONTENT:My team and I have inherited a large Android project from another team. The whole application with all the included libraries is reported to have around 35000 methods. We now have the task to implement a new service in the app where we need to use Protocol Buffers. The problem is that the generated .jar file with all the required .proto files creates another couple of 35000 methods, that's 70000 methods. And if you are not aware, the Android compiler has a limitation of 65536 methods per .dex file. We are clearly over that limit and we are getting the following error trying to compile the app: Unable to execute dex: method ID not in [0, 0xffff]: 65536
Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: method ID not in [0, 0xffff]: 65536
 Yes, the application architecture should probably be restructured but that will take time. And for now we are trying to figure out a solution to work around this problem temporarily. Any suggestions?

@CONTENT:I have a keyup event bound to a function that takes about a quarter of a second to complete. $("#search").keyup(function() {
  //code that takes a little bit to complete
});
 When a user types an entire word, or otherwise presses keys rapidly, the function will be called several times in succession and it will take a while for them all to complete. Is there a way to throttle the event calls so that if there are several in rapid succession, it only triggers the one that was most recently called?

@TITLE:Android: how to check how much memory is remaining?
@CONTENT:Below is my formula to check how much memory is remaining (not how much memory remains in the current heap, but how much more memory may be utilized before the application crashes). I'm not remotely sure this is correct, is it? double max = Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory(); //the maximum memory the app can use
double heapSize = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory(); //current heap size
double heapRemaining = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory(); //amount available in heap
double nativeUsage = Debug.getNativeHeapAllocatedSize(); //is this right? I only want to account for native memory that my app is being "charged" for.  Is this the proper way to account for that?

//heapSize - heapRemaining = heapUsed + nativeUsage = totalUsage
double remaining = max - (heapSize - heapRemaininng + nativeUsage);

@LINK:/questions/5380417/is-there-a-way-of-manipulating-ggplot-scale-breaks-and-labels
@TITLE:Is there a way of manipulating ggplot scale breaks and labels?
@CONTENT:ggplot generally does a good job of creating sensible breaks and labels in scales. However, I find that in plot with many facets and perhaps a formatter= statement, the labels tend to get too "dense" and overprint, for example in this picture: df <- data.frame(
        fac=rep(LETTERS[1:10], 100),
        x=rnorm(1000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x=x)) + 
  geom_bar(binwidth=0.5) + 
  facet_grid(~fac) + 
  scale_x_continuous(formatter="percent")
 I know that I can specify the breaks and labels of scales explicitly, by providing breaks= and scale= arguments to scale_x_continuous. However, I am processing survey data with many questions and a dozen crossbreaks, so need to find a way to do this automatically. Is there a way of telling ggplot to calculate breaks and labels automatically, but just have fewer, say at the minimum, maximum and zero point? EDIT: Ideally, I don't want to specify the minimum and maximum points, but somehow tap into the built-in ggplot training of scales, and use the default calculated scale limits.
@CODE:ggplot formatter= df <- data.frame(
        fac=rep(LETTERS[1:10], 100),
        x=rnorm(1000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x=x)) + 
  geom_bar(binwidth=0.5) + 
  facet_grid(~fac) + 
  scale_x_continuous(formatter="percent") breaks= scale= scale_x_continuous ggplot

@TITLE:What is the most efficient way to encode an arbitrary GUID into readable ASCII (33-127)?
@CONTENT:The standard string representation of GUID takes about 36 characters. Which is very nice, but also really wasteful. I am wondering, how to encode it in the shortest possible way using all the ASCII characters in the range 33-127. The naive implementation produces 22 characters, simply because 128 bits / 6 bits yields 22. Huffman encoding is my second best, the only question is how to choose the codes.... Any more ideas? Thanks. P.S. The encoding must be lossless, of course.

@TITLE:MenuItem tinting on AppCompat Toolbar
@CONTENT:When I use drawables from the AppCompat library for my Toolbar menu items the tinting works as expected. Like this: <item
    android:id="@+id/action_clear"
    android:icon="@drawable/abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha"  <-- from AppCompat
    android:title="@string/clear" />
 But if I use my own drawables or actually even copy the drawables from the AppCompat library to my own project it will not tint at all. <item
    android:id="@+id/action_clear"
    android:icon="@drawable/abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha_copy"  <-- copy from AppCompat
    android:title="@string/clear" />
 Is there some special magic in the AppCompat Toolbar that only tint drawables from that library? Any way to get this to work with my own drawables? Running this on API Level 19 device with compileSdkVersion = 21 and targetSdkVersion = 21, and also using everything from AppCompat abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha_copy is an exact copy of the abc_ic_clear_mtrl_alpha png from AppCompat Edit: The tinting is based on the value I have set for android:textColorPrimary in my theme. E.g. <item name="android:textColorPrimary">#00FF00</item> would give me a green tint color.

I've done some research, and most people suggest that it's got to do with running Magento on a localhost and browsers not saving cookies for domains with no dots in the domain name. The problem with that, however is that we're running it from http://staging.sitename... etc. Another few things that were suggested are where someone changed the default name for accessing the admin in the config, but we haven't changed it.

@TITLE:What's the difference between synchronous and asynchronous calls in Objective-C, versus multi-threading?
@CONTENT:For the longest time I thought asynchronous was synonymous to running something on a background thread, while synchronous meant on the main thread (blocking UI updates and interactions). I understand that not running on the main thread for expensive actions is because it doesn't allow UI actions to occur as the main thread is occupied, but why is synchronous troublesome? However, it's since came to my attention that you can make asynchronous calls on the main thread, and synchronous calls on background threads. I always hear people saying not to use expensive calls synchronously or on the main thread, as it will block the UI for the user. Are these two separate issues I should be making sure I don't do? What are the differences?

@CONTENT:Say I have an image of size 3841 x 7195 pixels. I would like to save the contents of the figure to disk, resulting in an image of the exact size I specify in pixels. No axis, no titles. Just the image. I don't personally care about DPIs, as I only want to specify the size the image takes in the screen in disk in pixels. I have read other threads, and they all seem to do conversions to inches and then specify the dimensions of the figure in inches and adjust dpi's in some way. I would like to avoid dealing with the potential loss of accuracy that could result from pixel-to-inches conversions. I have tried with: w = 7195
h = 3841
fig = plt.figure(frameon=False)
fig.set_size_inches(w,h)
ax = plt.Axes(fig, [0., 0., 1., 1.])
ax.set_axis_off()
fig.add_axes(ax)
ax.imshow(im_np, aspect='normal')
fig.savefig(some_path, dpi=1)
 with no luck (Python complains that width and height must each be below 32768 (?)) From everything I have seen, matplotlib requires the figure size to be specified in inches and dpi, but I am only interested in the pixels the figure takes in disk. How can I do this? To clarify: I am looking for a way to do this with matplotlib, and not with other image-saving libraries.

And I use a ContentProvider to deal with data, which obviously takes Uris but how does this mesh with the initLoader() method? Must I set up each of my Fragments to use Loaders individually? And how unique does the id need to be for each loader, is it over the scope of my app or just a fragment? Is there any simple way of simply passing a Uri to a CursorLoader to query my data?

When each TabSpec is created, I set an icon to be displayed in the tab header. The TabSpecs are created in this way within a setupTabs() method which loops to create the appropriate number of tabs: TabSpec ts = mTabs.newTabSpec("tab");

@TITLE:Asynchronous and Synchronous Terms
@CONTENT:I'm confused by the term asynchronous when related to programming. It seems to mean the opposite in programming terms as what it is defined as in the dictionary. For example, the word synchronous means: occurring at the same time; coinciding in time; contemporaneous; simultaneous. going on at the same rate and exactly together; recurring together. Yet, Wikipedia says: "In programming, asynchronous events are those occurring independently of the main program flow. Asynchronous actions are actions executed in a non-blocking scheme, allowing the main program flow to continue processing." Wouldn't something that is "non-blocking" and that allows "the main program flow to continue processing," be synchronized or "occurring at the same time"? It seems like the term synchronous suggests "non-blocking" and asynchronous, "blocking." Why do the terms appear to be used in reverse when related to programming, or does it have something to do with lower-level computing that I don't understand? When I use an synchronous AJAX call, I do the following... $.ajax({
  url: somefile.php,
  async: false,
  success: {
    ...code that gets run on success...
  }
});

...code that gets run after the ajax-success code runs...
 With this, it actually waits for a response before running the rest of the script, it's a blocking action. Then why is this termed synchronous, when it's not synchronized with any other process, but actually the opposite?
@CODE:$.ajax({
  url: somefile.php,
  async: false,
  success: {
    ...code that gets run on success...
  }

@TITLE:iOS MKMapView zoom to show all markers
@CONTENT:I'm working with MKMapView and have plotted several points on the map. I have used the MKCoordinateRegion and MKCoordinateSpan to enable zooming etc around one of the points - but that's not what I want... I'm trying to use something similar to the Javascript zoom to bounds function. so all my points should be visible to the user. (There will be around 10 points around the UK) I'd like to show them all, or if most of them were in the London area, zoom to there. Is there a way to work this out programatically?

@LINK:/questions/836875/creating-library-with-backward-compatible-abi-that-uses-boost
@TITLE:Creating Library with backward compatible ABI that uses Boost
@CONTENT:I'm working on certain C++ library (or more framework). I want to make it backward compatible with previous versions preserving not only API compatibility but also ABI (like the great job Qt does). I use lots of functionality of Boost and it seems for me that this makes backward compatibility just impossible, unless I force user to have exactly the same (sometimes old) version of Boost. Is there any way (without rewriting 1/2 of Boost) to make some "prefix" around its namespace/rename it in order to prevent it interferring with user version of Boost? For example my libXYZ uses Boost 1.33 and it has class boost::foo. In version 1.35 boost::foo was upgraded and new member was added, so, boost::foo from 1.33 and 1.35 are not ABI compatible. So, user of libXYZ must use Boost 1.33 or recompile libXYZ with Boost 1.35 (that may be already had broked some API in way XYZ would not compile). Note: I'm talking about UNIX/Liux OS with ELF where dynamic linking is similar to static linking, so you can't link with two different versions of libraries because symbols would interfer. One, sutiable solution I may think of is putting Boost in some other private namespace. So, libXYZ would use ::XYZ::boost::foo instead of ::boost::foo. This would prevent collision with other version of Boost that user may use. So, the libXYZ would continue to work with Boost 1.33 statically or dynamically linked with it withing other namespace, assuming, that it: Would not expose Boost API outside. Would keep stable private version of exposed API. Is there any way to do such things with Boost? Edit: Finally I decided to create a script that would rename all boost symbols in the source to some custom symbol. Rationale: simplification of build process, independent of compiler visibility support, also, it visibility works on dynamic libraries only, for static this does not work, so I need separate builds and dependencies for each type of libraries. The script is available there: http://art-blog.no-ip.info/files/rename.py Edit 2: Latest version of Boost BCP supports namespace renaming.

@TITLE:Embedded tomcat 7 servlet 3.0 annotations not working
@CONTENT:I have a stripped down test project which contains a Servlet version 3.0, declared with annotations like so:     @WebServlet("/test")
public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -3010230838088656008L;

    @Override
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException{
        response.getWriter().write("Test");
        response.getWriter().flush();
        response.getWriter().close();
    }
}
 I also have a web.xml file like so: <web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
      version="3.0">

      <servlet>
        <servlet-name>testServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>g1.TestServlet</servlet-class>
      </servlet>      

      <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>testServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/testWebXml</url-pattern>
      </servlet-mapping>

</web-app> 
 I've tried to make a JUnit test using Embedded Tomcat 7. When I start the Embedded Tomcat I can only access the servlet via the url-pattern declared in web.xml (/testWebXml). If I try to access it via the url-pattern declared via annotation (/test) it sais 404 page not found. Here's the code for my test:     String webappDirLocation = "src/main/webapp/";
    Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();
    tomcat.setPort(8080);

    tomcat.addWebapp("/jerseyTest", new File(webappDirLocation).getAbsolutePath());

    tomcat.start();
    tomcat.getServer().await();
 Just to make sure I've set up my project correctly, I've also installed an actual Tomcat 7 and deployed the war. This time, both web.xml declared url and annotation url for my servlet work ok. So my question is: does anyone know how to make Embedded Tomcat 7 take into account my Servlet 3.0 annotations? I should also state that it's a Maven project, and the pom.xml contains the following dependencies:     <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomcat-catalina</artifactId>
        <version>7.0.29</version>

        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
 == UPDATE == Here's an issue that seems similar to this (except the Servlet 3.0 annotation that is not working is on Listener, not Servlet), which has a suggested fix: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53903 I've tried it and it didn't work: Changed the Embedded Tomcat start code to: String webappDirLocation = "src/main/webapp/";
Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();

tomcat.enableNaming();
tomcat.setPort(8080);


Context ctx = tomcat.addWebapp(tomcat.getHost(), "/embeddedTomcat", new File(webappDirLocation).getAbsolutePath());
((StandardJarScanner) ctx.getJarScanner()).setScanAllDirectories(true);

tomcat.start();

tomcat.getServer().await();
 Other things I've tried, also without success: specifically setting metadata-complete="false" in web.xml "web-app" tag updating the Maven dependencies to version 7.0.30 debugging the org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig class. There's code there that checks for @WebServlet annotations, it's just that it never gets executed (line 2115). This may be a good way to get to the root of the issue, but the class is pretty big, and I don't have time to do this now. Maybe if someone would be willing to look how this class works, and under which conditions (config params) does it get to correctly check your project's classes for that annotation, it might get to a valid answer.

@LINK:/questions/4124900/is-there-a-way-to-use-two-statements-in-a-function-in-r
@TITLE:Is there a way to use two 'K' statements in a function in R?
@CONTENT:I want to write a function that calls both plot() and legend() and it would be ideal if the user could specify a number of additional arguments that are then passed through to either plot() or legend(). I know I can achieve this for one of the two functions using ...: foo.plot <- function(x,y,...) {
    plot(x,y,...)
    legend("bottomleft", "bar", pch=1)
}

foo.plot(1,1, xaxt = "n")
 This passes xaxt = "n" to plot. But is there a way for example to pass e.g. title = "legend" to the legend() call without prespecifying the arguments in the function header? Update from the accepted answer: I thought that VitoshKa's way was the most elegant to accomplish what I wanted. However, there were some minor issues that I had to get around with until it worked as I wanted. At first, I checked which of the parameters I want to pass to legend and which to plot. First step to this end was to see which arguments of legend are unique to legend and not part of plot and/or par: legend.args <- names(formals(legend))
plot.args <- c(names(formals(plot.default)), names(par()))
dput(legend.args[!(legend.args %in% plot.args)])
 I use dput() here, because the line plot.args <- c(names(formals(plot.default)), names(par())) always calls a new empty plot which I did not want. So, I used the output of dput in the following function. Next, I had to deal with the overlapping arguments (get them via dput(largs.all[(largs.all %in% pargs.all)])). For some this was trivial (e.g., x, y) others get passed to both functions (e.g., pch). But, in my real application I even use other strategies (e.g., different variable names for adj, but not implemented in this example). Finally, the do.call function had to be changed in two ways. First, the what part (i.e., called functions) needs to be a character (i.e., 'plot' instead of plot). And the argument list must be constructed slightly different. foo.plot <- function(x,y,...) {
    leg.args.unique <- c("legend", "fill", "border", "angle", "density", "box.lwd", "box.lty", "box.col", "pt.bg", "pt.cex", "pt.lwd", "xjust", "yjust", "x.intersp", "y.intersp", "text.width", "text.col", "merge", "trace", "plot", "ncol", "horiz", "title", "inset", "title.col", "title.adj")
    leg.args.all <- c(leg.args.unique, "col", "lty", "lwd", "pch", "bty", "bg", "cex", "adj", "xpd")
    dots <- list(...)
    do.call('plot', c(list(x = x, y = x), dots[!(names(dots) %in% leg.args.unique)]))
    do.call('legend', c(list("bottomleft", "bar"), dots[names(dots) %in% leg.args.all]))
}


foo.plot(1,1,pch = 4, title = "legendary", ylim = c(0, 5))
 In this example, pch is passed to both plot and legend, title is only passed to legend, and ylim only to plot. Update 2 based on a comment by Gavin Simpson (see also the comments at Vitoshka's answer): (i) That's correct. (ii) It can always be a character. But if you have a variable with the same name as the function, then you need to quote the function name in do.call: min.plot <- function(x,y,plot=TRUE) if(plot == TRUE) do.call(plot, list(x = x, y = y))
min.plot(1,1)
Error in do.call(plot, list(x = x, y = y)) : 
  'what' must be a character string or a function
 (iii) You can use c(x = 1, y = 1, list()) and it works fine. However, what I really did (not in the example I gave but in my real function) is the following: c(x = 1, y = 1, xlim = c(0, 2), list(bla='foo')) Please compare this with: c(list(x = 1, y = 1, xlim = c(0, 2)), list(bla='foo')) In the first case, the list contains two elements xlim, xlim1 and xlim2 (each a scalar), in the latter case the list has only xlim (which is vector of length 2, which is what I wanted). So, you are right in all your points for my example. But, for my real function (with a lot more variables), I encountered these problems and wanted to document them here. Sorry for being imprecise.

@TITLE:How to improve link performance for a large C++ application in VS2005
@CONTENT:We have fairly large C++ application which is composed of about 60 projects in Visual Studio 2005. It currently takes 7 minutes to link in Release mode and I would like to try to reduce the time. Are there any tips for improving the link time? Most of the projects compile to static libraries, this makes testing easier since each one also has a set of associated unit tests. It seems the use of static libraries prevents VS2005 from using incremental linking, so even with incremental linking turned on it does a full link every time. Would using DLLs for the sub projects make any difference? I don't really want to go through all the headers and add macros to export the symbols (even using a script) but if it would do something to reduce the 7 minute link time I will certainly consider it. For some reason using nmake from the command line is slightly faster and linking the same application on Linux (with GCC) is much faster. Visual Studio IDE 7 minutes Visual C++ using nmake from the command line - 5 minutes GCC on Linux 34 seconds

@TITLE:How to improve link performance for a large C++ application in VS2005
@CONTENT:We have fairly large C++ application which is composed of about 60 projects in Visual Studio 2005. It currently takes 7 minutes to link in Release mode and I would like to try to reduce the time. Are there any tips for improving the link time? Most of the projects compile to static libraries, this makes testing easier since each one also has a set of associated unit tests. It seems the use of static libraries prevents VS2005 from using incremental linking, so even with incremental linking turned on it does a full link every time. Would using DLLs for the sub projects make any difference? I don't really want to go through all the headers and add macros to export the symbols (even using a script) but if it would do something to reduce the 7 minute link time I will certainly consider it. For some reason using nmake from the command line is slightly faster and linking the same application on Linux (with GCC) is much faster. Visual Studio IDE 7 minutes Visual C++ using nmake from the command line - 5 minutes GCC on Linux 34 seconds

@TITLE:Why doesn't AspectJ compile-time weaving of Spring's @Configurable work?
@CONTENT:Update 5: I've downloaded the latest Spring ToolsSuite IDE based on the latest Eclipse. When I import my project as a Maven project, Eclipse/STS appears to use the Maven goals for building my project. This means AspectJ finally works correctly in Eclipse. Update 4: I have ended up just using Maven + AspectJ plugin for compile-time weaving, effectively bypassing Eclipse's mechanism. Update 3: It seems AspectJ's Eclipse plug-in breaks Eclipse's ability to correctly Publish to Tomcat. Only by removing the AspectJ capability on a project can I get it to properly Publish again. Very annoying. Update 2: I have this now working in Eclipse. It makes me very uncomfortable to say this, but I have no idea how I got it working from either Eclipse or Maven builds. It appears to be a compile issue rather than a run-time issue. Update 1: It appears I've gotten this to work via Maven builds, but I have no idea how. Eclipse still doesn't work. The only thing I changed in the pom.xml was adding these (insignificant?) configuration parameters: <source>1.6</source>
<complianceLevel>1.6</complianceLevel>
<verbose>true</verbose>
<showWeaveInfo>true</showWeaveInfo>
<outxml>true</outxml>
 I'm actually worried that I have a repeat of this problem, where everything works inconsistently. I will keep this question updated as I learn more. With regards to Eclipse, I made some progress by taking the binary aspects I wish to weave - in this case spring-aspects.jar - and copying it out of my classpath. I then add this now external jar to my Aspect Path. After doing this, Eclipse properly shows me AspectJ markers in my code. It's annoying that I can't just leave spring-aspects.jar in my Java Build Path which is maintained by Maven for me via the Maven plug-in. For some reason, however, the AspectJ plug-in doesn't see the binary aspects unless they're explicitly added to the Aspect Path. Original Post: @Configurable is a Spring annotation that allows dependencies to be injected into objects instantiated external to Spring (for example, by Hibernate or some Factory class). I was using this annotation previously with load-time weaving and it mostly worked. Occasionally I would boot up and nothing would get injected. This issue spawned this StackOverflow question. There weren't many answers, but most suggested that I try compile-time weaving instead due to greater reliability. I installed the AspectJ plug-in for Eclipse and Maven. Both of these produce what appears to be properly compiled classes. I've opened up one of the classes in a text editor before AspectJ compilation and found no references to AspectJ. I opened it up after AspectJ compilation and both Eclipse and Maven generated versions have a reference to org.aspectj.weaver.MethodDeclarationLineNumber. This is why I assume it's being properly compiled. The problem is that once deployed, no dependencies get injected. My Spring applicationContext.xml does include the following:     <context:spring-configured />

    <context:component-scan base-package="com.myapp" />
 Is the above all that's needed for classes marked @Configurable to have DI done? During the conversion from load-time weaving to compile-time weaving, I removed META-INF/aop.xml, <context:load-time-weaver /> from my applicationContext.xml, and Spring's Tomcat weaver from my context.xml. How can I investigate this problem further? What are possible causes?

@LINK:/questions/46030/c-sharp-force-form-focus
@TITLE:C# Force Form Focus
@CONTENT:So, I did search google and SO prior to asking this question. Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google. CLass Blah
{
        [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "SystemParametersInfo")]
        public static extern bool SystemParametersInfo(uint uiAction, uint uiParam, uint pvParam, uint fWinIni);

        [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "SetForegroundWindow")]
        public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

        [DllImport("User32.dll", EntryPoint = "ShowWindowAsync")]
        private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int cmdShow);
        private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL = 1;

    public void ShowMessage(string msg)
    {
            MessageForm msgFrm = new MessageForm();
            msgFrm.lblMessage.Text = "FOO";
            msgFrm.ShowDialog();
            msgFrm.BringToFront();
            msgFrm.TopMost = true;
            msgFrm.Activate();

            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 0, 0, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
            ShowWindowAsync(msgFrm.Handle, WS_SHOWNORMAL);
            SetForegroundWindow(msgFrm.Handle);
            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 200000, 200000, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
    }
}
 As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? @Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion: msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();
 The form still comes up under the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes. Thnks for all the ideas so far folks. Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.

Every time a build is performed, update the build date/time, and somehow update the build number Be able to see the build timestamp and number, to display on the screen be as simple to implement as possible

@TITLE:Multiple ajax calls at same time
@CONTENT:I have developed some websites and I always stumble a the same point: multiple ajax calls. I have a main page where all the content is loaded asynchronously. When the page is loaded, there are four INDEPENDENT calls that "draw" the page by areas (top, left, right and bottom) and while it is loaded I show to the user the typical ajax spins. So, when a request is received by the browser I execute the callback and the different areas are drawing at different time. The fact is that the answer for the server sometimes are mixed up, I mean, the answer of top is drawn in the left or vice-versa. I've tried some solutions like creating a timestamp in each request to indicate to the browser and server that each request is different. Also I've tried to configure some parameters of cache in the server, in case. The only way in which works has been including the request2 in the callback of the one, etc. Anyone knows the proper way to do it or ever has beaten this issue?? I don't want to do chained request. Thanks Here is an example of what I mean: $(document).ready(function() {

$.get('/activity',Common.genSafeId(),function(data){$('#stream').html(data);$("#load_activity").addClass("empty");});
$.get('/messages',Common.genSafeId(),function(data){$('#message').html(data);$("#load_messages").addClass("empty");});
$.get('/deals',Common.genSafeId(),function(data){$('#new_deals_container').html(data);$("#load_deal").addClass("empty");});
$.get('/tasks',Common.genSafeId(),function(data){$('#task_frames').html(data);$("#load_task").addClass("empty");});});
 And the html is a simple jsp with four container each one with a different id.
@CODE:$(document).ready(function() {

$.get('/activity',Common.genSafeId(),function(data){$('#stream').html(data);$("#load_activity").addClass("empty");});
$.get('/messages',Common.genSafeId(),function(data){$('#message').html(data);$("#load_messages").addClass("empty");});

@TITLE:How do I find the DOM node that is at a given (X,Y) position? (Hit test)
@CONTENT:I have the coordinates (X,Y) of a point in an HTML document. How do I determine what DOM node is at those coordinates? Some ideas: Is there a DOM hit test function that I missed, that takes a point (X,Y) and returns the DOM element there? Is there an efficient way to walk the DOM element tree to find the containing element? This seems like it would be tricky because of absolutely positioned elements. Is there a way to simulate an event at a given (X,Y) position such that the browser ends up creating an event object that has a pointer to the element? (Background: I'm embedding Qt's QWebView in a native application. I'm trying to vary the context menu that the Qt widget provides based on the DOM node that the mouse is over, but Qt 4.5 cannot hit test to a DOM element, though that functionality is coming in 4.6. So I'm hoping I can toss the the coordinate into Javascript and do the hit testing there with DOM APIs.) Thanks!

Is there some other alternative, such as if it is on the same line you don't? There is also another line like this: if ($action != ""): mail("$adminaddress","Visitor Comment from YOUR SITE", My instinct is to say this wouldn't work, but I also don't know if it is an outdated PHP file and it used to work?

 and do this : NSArray *Array = [result valueForKey:@"array"];
 Instead of an Array I got NSMutableString object. The website is already in production so I just cant ask them to change their existing structure to return a proper JSON object. It would be a lot of work for them. So, until they change the underlying stucture, is there any way i can make it work in iOS like they do with javascript on their website?

@TITLE:Android: application-wide font-size preference
@CONTENT:Is it possible to make an application-wide setting for the font-size to be used by all views displaying text? I would like to provide a Preference to the user which should allow scaling all text in the app. Android explicitly allows using the "sp" dimension unit for scalable text, however there is no actual way to set the "user's font size preference" in a global way. Iterating through all views on Activity instantiation is not really an option ;-)

 I can rewrite this using a context bound as follows def add[T: Numeric](x: T, y: T) = ??.plus(x,y)

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Has anyone had success with Visual Studio 6 on Windows 7? Does the VB6 IDE run on Windows 7 64-bit? I have been having problems installing VB6 on Windows 7. I realize it is a legacy IDE and my research on the net hasn't been that much of help. Every time I attempt to install VB6 on Windows 7, besides the alert notifying me of compatibility issues, the setup runs and fails near the end, to which the installation process fails ultimately. And when another attempt is made, certain dll files are supposedly unreachable. These are but some of the few links I have visited in the hopes of attaining a solution or even just seeing a few bread crumbs: - How to install VB6 on Windows 7 - VB6 on Windows 7 64-bit Before anyone says, "Why on earth would you want to install VB6 on Windows 7 when there are newer versions of Microsoft Visual Studio out!", VB6 is still required to maintain and update a legacy system already in place. So the question(s) is, is there a way to install VB6 on Windows 7 without compatibility issues? Is it better to install a virtual box and to run the VB6 IDE in XP? Or is there some other means to which I have not encountered that may be applicable to this dilemma? Thanks and kind regards, Craig

 However, what if I essentially need to run a script on (let's say) 15 servers at once. Is this doable in bash? In a perfect world I need to avoid installing applications if at all possible to pull this off. For argument's sake, let's just say that I need to do the following across 10 hosts: Deploy a new Tomcat container Deploy an application in the container, and configure it Configure an Apache vhost Reload Apache I have a script that does all of that, but it relies on me logging into all the servers, pulling a script down from a repo, and then running it. If this isn't doable in bash, what alternatives do you suggest? Do I need a bigger hammer, such as Perl (Python might be preferred since I can guarantee Python is on all boxes in a RHEL environment thanks to yum/up2date)? If anyone can point to me to any useful information it'd be greatly appreciated, especially if it's doable in bash. I'll settle for Perl or Python, but I just don't know those as well (working on that). Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/24135682/android-sending-data-20-bytes-by-ble
@TITLE:Android: Sending data >20 bytes by BLE
@CONTENT:I am able to send data upto 20 bytes by connecting to an external BLE device. How do I send data greater than 20 bytes. I have read that we have to either fragment the data or split characteristic to required parts. If I assume my data is 32 bytes, could you tell me changes I need to make in my code to get this working? Following are the required snippets from my code: public boolean send(byte[] data) {
    if (mBluetoothGatt == null || mBluetoothGattService == null) {
        Log.w(TAG, "BluetoothGatt not initialized");
        return false;
    }

    BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic =
            mBluetoothGattService.getCharacteristic(UUID_SEND);

    if (characteristic == null) {
        Log.w(TAG, "Send characteristic not found");
        return false;
    }

    characteristic.setValue(data);
    characteristic.setWriteType(BluetoothGattCharacteristic.WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE);
    return mBluetoothGatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristic);
}
 This is the code I used for sending the data. The "send" function is used in the following onclick event. sendValueButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.sendValue);
    sendValueButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            String text = dataEdit.getText().toString();                           
            yableeService.send(text.getBytes());
        }
    });
 When the String text is greater than 20 bytes then only the first 20 bytes are received. How to rectify this? To test sending multiple characteristics I tried this: sendValueButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.sendValue);
sendValueButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        String text = "Test1";                           
        yableeService.send(text.getBytes());

        text = "Test2";                           
        yableeService.send(text.getBytes());

        text = "Test3";                           
        yableeService.send(text.getBytes());
    }
});
 But I only received "Test3" i.e. the last characteristic. What mistake did I commit? I am new to BLE so please ignore any naiveness Edit: After accepting answer for anyone who views this later. There are two ways to accomplish this. 1. Split up your data and write in a loop as the selected answer does. 2. Split up your data and write using callback i.e. onCharacterisitcWrite(). This will save you from errors if there were any during writing. But most important between the writes use a Thread.sleep(200) if you are only writing and not waiting for a response from the firmware. This will ensure that all of your data reaches. Without the sleep I was always getting the last packet. If you notice the accepted answer he has also used sleep in between.
@CODE:public boolean send(byte[] data) {
    if (mBluetoothGatt == null || mBluetoothGattService == null) {
        Log.w(TAG, "BluetoothGatt not initialized");

    }

    BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic =
            mBluetoothGattService.getCharacteristic(UUID_SEND);

@TITLE:How to use encrypted password in apache BasicDataSource?
@CONTENT:At present i am keeping the password [ unencrypted ] in a property file. This password get placed as is in the configuration xml using ant. [ The configuration xml is for datasource, it is creating the object of dbcp.BasicDataSource ] Now, is it possible that after the ant target the password is copied in encrypted form. Heard the Jasypt can do that! Till now i haven't tried this. But, the problem doesn't end here. BasicDataSource do not accept encrypted password. Is there any replacement for BasicDatasource. FYI: I am using Spring, if that matters.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to send an array to another page. What I tryed before was: page1 <input type='hidden' name='input_name' value='<?php print_r($array_name); ?>' />
 And page2 <?php

 Now how do I make $passed_array act like an array? Or do you know of any other way of solving this problem? Thanks, Mike. Edit: The reason I want to do it this way is because I need to avoid sessions and cookies.

@LINK:/questions/15040955/javascript-oop-and-prototypes-with-multiple-level-inheritance
@TITLE:Javascript OOP and prototypes with multiple-level inheritance
@CONTENT:I'm new to Javascript programming and I'm approaching my first application (a game, indeed) from an object oriented programming perspective (I know js is not really object oriented, but for this particular problem it was easier for me to start like this). I have a hierarchy of "classes" where the top-most ("Thing" class) defines a list of related things (attached items in the game). It's inherited by a ThingA class which is inherited by ThingA1 and ThingA2 classes. The minimal example would be: function Thing() 
{
  this.relatedThings   = [];
}
Thing.prototype.relateThing = function(what)
{
  this.relatedThings.push(what);
}

ThingA.prototype = new Thing();
ThingA.prototype.constructor = ThingA;
function ThingA()
{
}

ThingA1.prototype = new ThingA();
ThingA1.prototype.constructor = ThingA1;
function ThingA1()
{

}

ThingA2.prototype = new ThingA();
ThingA2.prototype.constructor = ThingA2;
function ThingA2()
{    
}

var thingList = [];

thingList.push(new ThingA());
thingList.push(new ThingA1());
thingList.push(new ThingA2());
thingList.push(new ThingA2());
thingList.push(new Thing());

thingList[1].relateThing('hello');
 At the end of the code, when the relateThing is executed, every ThingA, ThingA1 and ThingA2 is going to execute it (not the last "Thing" object in the array). I've found if I define the relateThing function in the ThingA prototype, it will work right. Because of how the game is designed I'll prefer not to have to do that. Maybe I'm not understanding something about how the prototypes work in javascript. I know the function is shared among all the objects, but i guess the execution would be individual. Could somebody explain why is this happening and how to solve it? I don't know if I'm doing the inheritance wrong, or the prototypes definitions, or what. Thanks in advance.
@CODE:function Thing() 
{
  this.relatedThings   = [];
}
Thing.prototype.relateThing = function(what)
{
  this.relatedThings.push(what);
}

ThingA.prototype = new Thing();
ThingA.prototype.constructor = ThingA;
function ThingA()
{
}

ThingA1.prototype = new ThingA();
ThingA1.prototype.constructor = ThingA1;
function ThingA1()
{

}

ThingA2.prototype = new ThingA();
ThingA2.prototype.constructor = ThingA2;
function ThingA2()
{    
}

var thingList = [];

thingList.push(new ThingA());
thingList.push(new ThingA1());
thingList.push(new ThingA2());

@TITLE:Encrypt SQLite database in C#
@CONTENT:What is the best approach to encrypting a SQLite database file in .Net/C#? I'm using sqlite-dotnet2 wrapper. There are tools like SQLite Encryption Extension and SQLite Crypt, but both are non-free, while my project is under GPL. The naive approach I thought of using was to let SQLite handle a temporary file, then to encrypt it on program exit, and overwrite (zero-out) the original. The obvious drawback is that if program crashes (and while it is running), the plain text DB is accessible. Is there a better way to approach this? Can I pass an encrypted stream to the wrapper (instead of using SQLiteConnection.CreateFile) ? [edit] Maybe I am overthinking this. Is is sufficient to use Password option in the connection string? Would the file be encrypted properly in that case (or is it some weaker protection)?

@TITLE:Creating a python win32 service
@CONTENT:I am currently trying to create a win32 service using pywin32. My main point of reference has been this tutorial: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/551780/ What i don't understand is the initialization process, since the Daemon is never initialized directly by Daemon(), instead from my understanding its initialized by the following: mydaemon = Daemon
__svc_regClass__(mydaemon, "foo", "foo display", "foo description")
__svc_install__(mydaemon)

@TITLE:Using ui-router with Bootstrap-ui modal
@CONTENT:I know this has been covered many times and most articles refer to this bit of code: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21213422/1031184 But I just don't get it. I don't find that to be very clear at all. I also found this http://jsfiddle.net/sloot/ceWqw/3/ which was actually great, very helpful except this doesn't add the url and allow for me to use the back button to close the modal. Edit: This is what I need help with. So let me try explain what I am trying to achieve. I have a form to add a new item, and I have a link 'add new item'. I would like when I click 'add new item' a modal pops up with the form I have created 'add-item.html'. This is a new state so the url changes to /add-item. I can fill out the form and then choose to save or close. Close, closes the modal :p (how odd) . But I can also click back to close the modal as well and return to the previous page(state). I don't need help with Close at this point as I am still struggling with actually getting the modal working. This is my code as it stands: Navigation Controller: (is this even the correct place to put the modal functions?) angular.module('cbuiRouterApp')
  .controller('NavbarCtrl', function ($scope, $location, Auth, $modal) {
    $scope.menu = [{
      'title': 'Home',
      'link': '/'
    }];

    $scope.open = function(){

        // open modal whithout changing url
        $modal.open({
          templateUrl: 'components/new-item/new-item.html'
        });

        // I need to open popup via $state.go or something like this
        $scope.close = function(result){
          $modal.close(result);
        };
      };

    $scope.isCollapsed = true;
    $scope.isLoggedIn = Auth.isLoggedIn;
    $scope.isAdmin = Auth.isAdmin;
    $scope.getCurrentUser = Auth.getCurrentUser;

    $scope.logout = function() {
      Auth.logout();
      $location.path('/login');
    };

    $scope.isActive = function(route) {
      return route === $location.path();
    };
  });
 This is how I am activating the modal:  li(ng-show='isLoggedIn()', ng-class='{active: isActive("/new-item")}')
        a(href='javascript: void 0;', ng-click='open()')
          | New Item
 new-item.html: <div class="modal-header">
  <h3 class="modal-title">I'm a modal!</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="item in items"><a ng-click="selected.item = item">{{ item }}</a></li>
  </ul>Selected:<b>{{ selected.item }}</b>
</div>
<div class="modal-footer">
  <button ng-click="ok()" class="btn btn-primary">OK</button>
  <button ng-click="close()" class="btn btn-primary">OK</button>
</div>
 Also whilst this does open a modal it doesn't close it as I couldn't work that out.
@CODE:angular.module('cbuiRouterApp')
  .controller('NavbarCtrl', function ($scope, $location, Auth, $modal) {
    $scope.menu = [{
      'title': 'Home',
      'link': '/'
    }];

    $scope.open = function(){

        // open modal whithout changing url
        $modal.open({
          templateUrl: 'components/new-item/new-item.html'
        });

        // I need to open popup via $state.go or something like this
        $scope.close = function(result){
          $modal.close(result);
        };
      };

    $scope.isCollapsed = true;
    $scope.isLoggedIn = Auth.isLoggedIn;
    $scope.isAdmin = Auth.isAdmin;
    $scope.getCurrentUser = Auth.getCurrentUser;

@TITLE:jQuery framework internals
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand the internals of how jquery framework is written and finding it hard to understand the code. Does anyone have any suggestions regarding a good way to get started. Thanks for all the useful input. Editing the topic since I had limited space for adding individual comments. I have written a lot of basic javascript code. I know basic DOM, have used event handlers, know CSS basics. I have read about many of the topics you have mentioned and I am familiar with it although not an expert and have not coded some of the advanced topics like closures. Here are the books I have used so far Head first javascript - good in the beginning as a starter. Books my friends have recommended and I use regularly are Javascript - The Definitive Guide, Javascript - The good parts (I read this a while ago and it was hard for me at the time). My friend just recommended Secrets of Javascript Ninja - John Resig. Seems like a good one. I ordered the Javascript Design patterns book you recommend last week I have read the https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript you pointed me to. I will checkout some of the other resources you pointed me to. Let me think a little more regarding if I want to do a little more reading before I post specific questions I have on jquery. Thanks Susan

@TITLE:How to get the pixel color on touch?
@CONTENT:I know this is a common question and there are a lot of answers of this question. I've used some of this. Although many of them are the same. But the sad thing for me is that none of them worked for me. The following codes i've used till now. -(void)getRGBAsFromImage:(UIImage*)image atX:(int)xx andY:(int)yy
{
    // First get the image into your data buffer
    CGImageRef imageRef = [image CGImage];
    NSUInteger width = CGImageGetWidth(imageRef);
    NSUInteger height = CGImageGetHeight(imageRef);
    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
    unsigned char *rawData = (unsigned char*) calloc(height * width * 4, sizeof(unsigned char));
    NSUInteger bytesPerPixel = 4;
    NSUInteger bytesPerRow = bytesPerPixel * width;
    NSUInteger bitsPerComponent = 8;
    CGContextRef context = CGBitmapContextCreate(rawData, width, height,
                                                 bitsPerComponent, bytesPerRow, colorSpace,
                                                 kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast | kCGBitmapByteOrder32Big);
    CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);

    CGContextDrawImage(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, width, height), imageRef);
    CGContextRelease(context);

    // Now your rawData contains the image data in the RGBA8888 pixel format.
    int byteIndex = (bytesPerRow * yy) + xx * bytesPerPixel;

    CGFloat red   = (rawData[byteIndex]     * 1.0) / 255.0;
    CGFloat green = (rawData[byteIndex + 1] * 1.0) / 255.0;
    CGFloat blue  = (rawData[byteIndex + 2] * 1.0) / 255.0;
    CGFloat alpha = (rawData[byteIndex + 3] * 1.0) / 255.0;
    byteIndex += 4;
    NSLog(@"the vale of the rbg of red is %f",red);

    demoColor.tintColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha];
    free(rawData);
}
 Here is another approach i've used - - (CGContextRef) createARGBBitmapContextFromImage:(CGImageRef) inImage {

    CGContextRef    context = NULL;
    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace;
    void *          bitmapData;

    int             bitmapBytesPerRow;

    // Get image width, height. We'll use the entire image.
    size_t pixelsWide = CGImageGetWidth(inImage);
    size_t pixelsHigh = CGImageGetHeight(inImage);

    // Declare the number of bytes per row. Each pixel in the bitmap in this
    // example is represented by 4 bytes; 8 bits each of red, green, blue, and
    // alpha.
    bitmapBytesPerRow   = (pixelsWide * 4);
    bitmapByteCount     = (bitmapBytesPerRow * pixelsHigh);

    // Use the generic RGB color space.
    //colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateWithName(kCGColorSpaceGenericRGB);
    colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
    if (colorSpace == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error allocating color space\n");
        return NULL;
    }

    // Allocate memory for image data. This is the destination in memory
    // where any drawing to the bitmap context will be rendered.
    bitmapData = malloc( bitmapByteCount );
    if (bitmapData == NULL)
    {
        fprintf (stderr, "Memory not allocated!");
        CGColorSpaceRelease( colorSpace );
        return NULL;
    }

    // Create the bitmap context. We want pre-multiplied ARGB, 8-bits
    // per component. Regardless of what the source image format is
    // (CMYK, Grayscale, and so on) it will be converted over to the format

    context = CGBitmapContextCreate (bitmapData,
                                     pixelsWide,
                                     pixelsHigh,

    if (context == NULL)
    {
        free (bitmapData);
        fprintf (stderr, "Context not created!");
    }

    // Make sure and release colorspace before returning
    CGColorSpaceRelease( colorSpace );

    return context;
}


- (UIColor*) getPixelColorAtLocation:(CGPoint)point {

 But none of these has been worked for me. Please help me out to work with this. Is there anything i'm missing ? I have 2 UIImageView in my UI. The one which is in back contains the image from which i need to pick the color of a pixel that is touched. And the other UIImageView is to paint over the back image with the picked color.

@TITLE:Choosing background for Live Wallpaper
@CONTENT:I'm writing a live wallpaper that creates an effect over a background. I want the user to be able to choose the background from any of the system wallpapers and camera photos. What I would like is for the user to be able to press a button in the Settings menu, have the list of options show up just like setting the wallpaper from the home screen, minus the Live Wallpapers options. Once the user navigates the choices and picks an actually image I would load it to my canvas. How do I do this? I can't find an API anywhere for getting a list of wallpapers. I've been able to come up with a list of wallpaper providers using Intents. I then get a list of live wallpaper providers also using Intents and remove those from my first list. The gives me a list of wallpaper providers that are not live. Now what? Are there other ways to do this that I'm missing? Please help.

@TITLE:background-size in shorthand background property (CSS3)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to mix background-image and background-size properties in a shorthanded background property. Based on W3C documentation background-size should come after background-position property separated with an slash(/). W3C example: p { background: url("chess.png") 40% / 10em gray
       round fixed border-box; } 
 is equivalent to: p {
    background-color: gray;
    background-position: 40% 50%;
    background-size: 10em 10em;
    background-repeat: round round;
    background-clip: border-box;
    background-origin: border-box;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-image: url(chess.png) }
 MDN says same thing. I also found this and this article about shorthand CSS3 background property explaining this. But this is not working! It also is not clear how to make a shorthand background property when background-size and background-position have two different values for background-position-x and background-position-y or same thing for background-size. It's not clear how the slash(/) takes place? This example is not working in my Chrome 15. Example I tried to make a shorthand is this CSS code: div {  
    background: url(http://www.placedog.com/125/125) 
        0 0 /  150px 100px 
        repeat no-repeat

    height: 300px;
    width:360px;

}

@TITLE:Original purpose of <input type=hidden>? [closed]
@CONTENT:I am curious about the original purpose of the <input type="hidden"> tag. Nowadays it is often used together with JavaScript to store variables in it which are sent to the server and things like that. HTML 2.0 was released in November 1995, containing already the specification for input type="hidden" JavaScript was released March 1996 Therefore, the <input type="hidden"> existed before JavaScript, so what was its original purpose? I can only imagine of sending a value from the server to the client which is (unchanged) sent back to maintain a kind of a state. Or do I get something wrong in the history of it and <input type="hidden"> was always supposed to be used together with JavaScript? If possible, please also give references in your answers.

@TITLE:Update a record without first querying?
@CONTENT:Lets say I query the database and load a list of items. Then I open one of the items in a detail view form, and instead of re-querying the item out of the database, I create an instance of the item from the datasource in the list. Is there a way I can update the database record without fetching the record of the individual item? Here is a sample how I am doing it now: dataItem itemToUpdate = (from t in dataEntity.items
                                 where t.id == id
                                 select t).FirstOrDefault();
 Then after pulling the record I update some values in the item and push the record back: itemToUpdate.itemstatus = newStatus;
dataEntity.SaveChanges();
 I would think there would be a better way to do this, any ideas?

@LINK:/questions/388069/python-graceful-future-feature-future-import
@TITLE:Python graceful future feature (__future__) import
@CONTENT:How do you gracefully handle failed future feature imports? If a user is running using Python 2.5 and the first statement in my module is: from __future__ import print_function
 Compiling this module for Python 2.5 will fail with a:   File "__init__.py", line 1
    from __future__ import print_function
SyntaxError: future feature print_function is not defined
 I'd like to inform the user that they need to rerun the program with Python >= 2.6 and maybe provide some instructions on how to do so. However, to quote PEP 236: The only lines that can appear before a future_statement are: The module docstring (if any). Comments. Blank lines. Other future_statements. So I can't do something like: import __future__

if hasattr(__future__, 'print_function'):
    from __future__ import print_function
else:
    raise ImportError('Python >= 2.6 is required')
 Because it yields:   File "__init__.py", line 4
    from __future__ import print_function
SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file
 This snippet from the PEP seems to give hope of doing it inline: Q: I want to wrap future_statements in try/except blocks, so I can use different code depending on which version of Python I'm running. Why can't I? A: Sorry! try/except is a runtime feature; future_statements are primarily compile-time gimmicks, and your try/except happens long after the compiler is done. That is, by the time you do try/except, the semantics in effect for the module are already a done deal. Since the try/except wouldn't accomplish what it looks like it should accomplish, it's simply not allowed. We also want to keep these special statements very easy to find and to recognize. Note that you can import __future__ directly, and use the information in it, along with sys.version_info, to figure out where the release you're running under stands in relation to a given feature's status. Ideas?
@CODE:from __future__ import print_function File "__init__.py", line 1

SyntaxError: future feature print_function is not defined import __future__

@TITLE:Why does std::stack use std::deque by default?
@CONTENT:Since the only operations required for a container to be used in a stack are: back() push_back() pop_back() Why is the default container for it a deque instead of a vector? Don't deque reallocations give a buffer of elements before front() so that push_front() is an efficient operation? Aren't these elements wasted since they will never ever be used in the context of a stack? If there is no overhead for using a deque this way instead of a vector, why is the default for priority_queue a vector not a deque also? (priority_queue requires front(), push_back(), and pop_back() - essentially the same as for stack) Updated based on the Answers below: It appears that the way deque is usually implemented is a variable size array of fixed size arrays. This makes growing faster than a vector (which requires reallocation and copying), so for something like a stack which is all about adding and removing elements, deque is likely a better choice. priority_queue requires indexing heavily, as every removal and insertion requires you to run pop_heap() or push_heap(). This probably makes vector a better choice there since adding an element is still amortized constant anyways.

@TITLE:iOS: popViewController unexpected behavior
@CONTENT:I've been searching the internet for a solution. There's nothing I could find. So: I'm using a UINavigationController. I am pushing two UIViewControllers onto it. In the second pushed ViewController i am executing this code: - (void)reverseGeocoder:(MKReverseGeocoder *)geocoder didFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
NSLog([error localizedDescription]);
[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES]; }
 The expected thing to happen would be that the last pushed ViewController disappears. In this app I am doing this on few places and it works fine everywhere expect in this very ViewController. What happens is that only the back button goes off screen (animated) but everything else stays on screen. In the Console Output two things are printed out when this line executes: 2011-03-14 16:32:44.580 TheAppXY[18518:207] nested pop animation can result in corrupted navigation bar 2011-03-14 16:32:53.507 TheAppXY[18518:207] Finishing up a navigation transition in an unexpected state. Navigation Bar subview tree might get corrupted. Two error messages I couldn't find ANY information on. I'm using XCode 4 and iOS SDK 4.3. Maybe anyone can help me with this problem.

// safely pull off the value
int value = objectA.PropertyA.PropertyB.PropertyC;
}
 It would be nice to do something more like this (pseudo-code). int value = ObjectA.PropertyA.PropertyB ? ObjectA.PropertyA.PropertyB : defaultVal;
 Possibly even further collapsed with a null-coalescing operator. EDIT Originally I said my second example was like js, but I changed it to psuedo-code since it was correctly pointed out that it would not work in js. Thanks much, Jon

@TITLE:How can I refresh the ActionBar when onPrepareOptionsMenu switched menu entries?
@CONTENT:Within my apps I often enable/disable menu entries and do make them visible from onPrepareOptionsMenu. Today I started to add the android:showAsAction menu attribute to some of my Android 2.x apps to show menu entries used most on the ActionBar. The ActionBar does not reflect the enable/disable and visibility immediately. I need to click on the menu dropdown on the right to see this change happen. Ok, I do understand that the menu fires onPrepareOptionsMenu. But what do I need to do to refresh the ActionBar? I think this change needs to be applied from within onOptionsItemSelected but I don't know what I should call. Here's the menu: <item
    android:icon="@drawable/ic_menu_mapmode"
    android:id="@+id/men_mapview"
    android:showAsAction="ifRoom|withText"
    android:title="@string/txt_mapview" />

<item
    android:icon="@drawable/ic_menu_mapmode"
    android:id="@+id/men_satelliteview"
    android:showAsAction="ifRoom|withText"
    android:title="@string/txt_satelliteview" />
 Here's the onPrepareOptionsMenu: @Override
public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenu(final Menu menu) {
    MenuItem menuItemMapView = menu.findItem(R.id.men_mapview);
    MenuItem menuItemSatelliteView = menu.findItem(R.id.men_satelliteview);

    if (mapView.isSatellite()) {
        menuItemMapView.setEnabled(true).setVisible(true);
        menuItemmenuItemSatelliteView.setEnabled(false).setVisible(false);
    } else {
        menuItemMapView.setEnabled(false).setVisible(false);
        menuItemmenuItemSatelliteView.setEnabled(true).setVisible(true);
    }

    return super.onPrepareOptionsMenu(menu);
}
 Here's the onOptionsItemSelected @Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(final MenuItem menuItem) {
    switch (menuItem.getItemId()) {
        case R.id.men_mapview:
            mapView.setSatellite(false);
            mapView.setStreetView(true);
            mapView.invalidate();

            invalidateOptionsMenu(); // This works on Android 3.x devices only
            return true;
        case R.id.men_satelliteview:
            mapView.setSatellite(true);
            mapView.setStreetView(false);

            invalidateOptionsMenu(); // This works on Android 3.x devices only
            return true;
    }

    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(menuItem);
}

 The a::LOCAL_A is what the strongly typed enum is trying to achieve, but there is a small difference : normal enums can be converted into integer type, while strongly typed enums can not do it without a cast. So, is there a way to convert a strongly typed enum value into an integer type without a cast? If yes, how?

@TITLE:Using usort in php with a class private function
@CONTENT:ok using usort with a function is not so complicated This is what i had before in my linear code function merchantSort($a,$b){
    return ....// stuff;
}

$array = array('..','..','..');
 to sort i simply do usort($array,"merchantSort");
 Now we are upgrading the code and removing all global functions and putting them in their appropriate place. Now all the code is in a class and i can't figure out how to use the usort function to sort the array with the parameter that is an object method instead of a simple function class ClassName {
   ...

   private function merchantSort($a,$b) {
       return ...// the sort
   }

   public function doSomeWork() {

       $array = $this->someThingThatReturnAnArray();
       usort($array,'$this->merchantSort'); // ??? this is the part i can't figure out
   ...

   }
}
 The question is how do i call an object method inside the usort() function
@CODE:function merchantSort($a,$b){
    return ....// stuff;
}

$array = array('..','..','..'); usort($array,"merchantSort"); class ClassName {

@CONTENT:I have an application with several Activities in Android and I want the user to be able to log-out by pressing a menu button. The problem I have is that A) Android doesn't let you terminate the application and B) even when I send the user to the LoginActivity again they can always press back and get right back to the previous activity they were in. I already tried to launch the Activity with the two following flags: Intent intent  = new Intent(this, LoginActivity.class);
intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);        
startActivity(intent);
 I also tried with each one of them by themselves. I also tried calling finish() after startActivity(intent) as I read in another StackOverflow question.
@CODE:LoginActivity Intent intent  = new Intent(this, LoginActivity.class);
intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);

He didn't convinced my at all, but I have to admit I lack of real-life examples to strengthen my point. Who is right here ?

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How do you find all implementations of an interface? 11 answers Is there a quick way to find all of the implementations of, not references to, an interface's method/property/etc? Here's some sample code: public class SomeClass : IBaseClass

public interface IBaseClass

 I want to quickly get to SomeClass.GetInt() while reviewing SomeOtherClass.TestMethod(). If I right click on _someClass.GetInt() and click 'Go To Definition', it takes me to the interface. If I click 'Find All References', I could potentially see a list of all uses ... not just the classes that implement the GetInt() method. Is there a faster way to find this? Any tips from other developers? We are using D.I. for most of our dependencies, which means that tracing through deeply nested code takes forever.

  public Int32 GetInt()

@TITLE:Android: Cloning a drawable in order to make a StateListDrawable with filters
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a general framework function that makes any Drawable become highlighted when pressed/focused/selected/etc. My function takes a Drawable and returns a StateListDrawable, where the default state is the Drawable itself, and the state for android.R.attr.state_pressed is the same drawable, just with a filter applied using setColorFilter. My problem is that I can't clone the drawable and make a separate instance of it with the filter applied. Here is what I'm trying to achieve: StateListDrawable makeHighlightable(Drawable drawable)
{
    StateListDrawable res = new StateListDrawable();

    Drawable clone = drawable.clone(); // how do I do this??

    clone.setColorFilter(0xFFFF0000, PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY);
    res.addState(new int[] {android.R.attr.state_pressed}, clone);
    res.addState(new int[] { }, drawable);
    return res;
}
 If I don't clone then the filter is obviously applied to both states. I tried playing with mutate() but it doesn't help.. Any ideas? Update: The accepted answer indeed clones a drawable. It didn't help me though because my general function fails on a different problem. It seems that when you add a drawable to a StateList, it loses all its filters.

Working with some low level code, occasionally you need to work with bytes that have unsigned values greater than 128, which causes Java to interpret them as a negative number due to the MSB being used for sign. What's a good way to work around this? (Saying don't use Java is not an option)

@LINK:/questions/4227145/in-matlab-are-variables-really-double-precision-by-default
@TITLE:In MATLAB, are variables REALLY double-precision by default?
@CONTENT:This question arose out of something strange that I noticed after investigating this question further... I always understood MATLAB variables to be double-precision by default. So, if I were to do something like declare a variable with 20 digits after the decimal point: >> num = 2.71828182845904553488;
>> class(num)  %# Display the variable type
ans =
double
 I would expect the last 4 digits to be ignored, since the floating-point relative accuracy is on the order of 10-16: >> eps(num)
ans =
    4.440892098500626e-016
 If I try to display the number with more than 16 digits after the decimal point (using either FPRINTF or SPRINTF), I get what I expect to see: >> fprintf('%0.20f\n',num)
2.71828182845904550000
>> sprintf('%0.20f',num)
ans =
2.71828182845904550000
 In other words, digits 17 through 20 are all 0. But things get weird when I pass num to the variable precision arithmetic function in the Symbolic Toolbox, telling it to represent the number using 21 digits of precision: >> vpa(num,21)
ans =
2.71828182845904553488
 WHAT?! Those last 4 digits have reappeared! Shouldn't they have been lost when the original number I entered was stored as a double-precision variable num? Since num is a double-precision variable when it is passed to vpa, how did vpa know what they were? My best guess as to what is happening is that MATLAB internally represents num with more precision than a double since I initialized it to a number with more digits past the decimal point than a double-precision variable could handle. Is this really what is happening, or is something else going on? BONUS: And here's an additional source of confusion if you don't already have a migraine from the above... >> num = 2.71828182845904553488;  %# Declare with 20 digits past the decimal
>> num = 2.718281828459045531;    %# Re-declare with 18 digits past the decimal
>> vpa(num,21)
ans =
2.71828182845904553488  %# It's the original 20-digit number!!!
@CODE:>> num = 2.71828182845904553488;

@TITLE:Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt
@CONTENT:I'm hoping someone can enlighten me as to what could possibly be causing this error: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt. I cannot really post code because this error seems to get thrown in any random area of the application. The application will run anywhere from 12-48 hours before throwing the error. Sometimes it will stop in a seemingly random spot and throw the above error, other times the entire application stops and I get a screen with an error that says something along the lines of "There was a fatal error in... This may be a bug in the CLR or..." something about PInvoke or other non relevant info. When this happens all threads show terminated and there is no debugging information available. In a nutshell this is what the application does: Its a multi-threaded server application written in entirely in C#. Clients connect to the server via socket. The server runs a virtual "environment" for the clients where they can interact with each other and the environment. It consumes quite a bit of memory but I do not see it leaking. It typically consumes about 1.5GB. I dont think its leaking because the memory usage stays relatively constant the entire time the application is running. Its constantly running code to maintain the environment even if the clients are not doing anything. It uses no 3rd party software or other APIs. The only outside resources this application uses is socket connections and SQL database connections. Its running on a 64bit server. I have tried debugging this in VS2008 & VS2010 using .net 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0 and on multiple servers and the problem still eventually occurs. I've tried turning off compiler optimizations and several microsoft hot-fixes. Nothing seems to make this issue go away. It would be appreciated if anyone knows any possible causes, or some kind of way to identify whats causing the problem.

What exactly does that mean? After reading this article: http://www.asql.biz/Articoli/SQLX08/Art1_5.aspx I uninstalled the 2005 version of the SQL Management Studio but received the same error from the 2008 installer during my follow-up attempt. Updates 1) Uninstalled the SQL 2005 Management Studio only. Received the same error from the 2008 install. 2) Removed all SQL 2005 common components. Received the same error from the 2008 install. 3) Installed the shared components from the SQL 2008 installation program. Received the same error from the 2008 install when trying to install the new SQL 2008 instance. 4) Uninstalled SQL 2008 components, rebooted, re-installed SQL 2005 Management Studio from installation media, rebooted, un-installed SQL 2005 Workstation Components from Control Panel, re-booted. Installation of SQL 2008 is now proceeding as it should. Seems likely that if I'd re-booted after update 2 above things would have gone more smoothly. :-(

When I run java -version from the command line, instead of invoking my JDK 1.6 installation, it runs the 1.7 JRE.

Should we convert every <b> to <strong> blindly?

Dreamweaver has also given the option to convert all <b> and <i> to <strong> and <em> on code paste in design view and when we use B and I Which people use blindly. And Dreamweaver (if above option is checked) and many online WYSIWYG editor give output in <strong> and <em> while button shows B and I. In my opinion it's creating a misconception about <strong> and <b> When we get content from a client we don't know where the client wants to give emphasize and where he just wants to use bold text for presentation purposes. What should we do in this circumstance?

@CONTENT:I have an ASP.net Web Site Project (.net 3.5). Currently all of the non-code behind code files (including Linq2Sql stuff, data contexts, business logic, extension methods, etc) are located in the App_Code folder. I am interested in introducing Unit Testing (using nunit) in at least some sections of the project moving forward. Any Unit Testing that I would be doing would need to have full access to all of the code that is currently located in the App_Code folder. I have done some initial reading so far, and the consensus seems to be: This will not be possible given my current setup Unit testing requires referencing classes that are part of a compiled dll, and a Web Site Project by definition only compiles at run time. In order to proceed, I will need to either convert my entire project to a Web Application, or move all of the code that I would like to test (ie: the entire contents of App_Code) to a class library project and reference the class library project in the web site project. Either of these will provide access to the classes that I need in compiled dll format, which will allow me to Unit Test them. Is this correct? Or is there another way that I can Unit Test without restructuring/refactoring my entire project?

How to do this in R? For example, I would like to compute the density of a 2D standard Normal distribution on three points: bivariate.density(x=c(0,0),mu=c(0,0), sigma=c(1,1), rho=0){
    exp(-1/(2*(1-rho^2))*(x[1]^2/sigma[1]^2+x[2]^2/sigma[2]^2-2*rho*x[1]*x[2]/(sigma[1]*sigma[2]))) * 1/(2*pi*sigma[1]*sigma[2]*sqrt(1-rho^2))
}

out=rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4),c(5,6));
 How to apply the function to each row of out? How to pass values for the other arguments besides the points to the function in the way you specify? Thanks!
@CODE:bivariate.density(x=c(0,0),mu=c(0,0), sigma=c(1,1), rho=0){
    exp(-1/(2*(1-rho^2))*(x[1]^2/sigma[1]^2+x[2]^2/sigma[2]^2-2*rho*x[1]*x[2]/(sigma[1]*sigma[2]))) * 1/(2*pi*sigma[1]*sigma[2]*sqrt(1-rho^2))
}

out=rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4),c(5,6)); out

From Java debugger: org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.javassist.JavassistLazyInitializer@7632012e
 I am using Gson to convert my Java objects to JSON. Below I have pasted some of my code. This is my resource: @Stateless
@LocalBean
@Path("/autos")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class AutoResource {

    @EJB
    private CarAssembler warehouse;
    @Context
    private UriInfo uriInfo;

    @GET
    public Response allAutos() {
        // Building a context, lots of code...
        // Creating a Gson instance and configures it...

        final Auto auto = warehouse.list(context);
        final String autoJson = gson.toJson(auto);

        return Response.ok(autoJson).build();
    }
}
 The CarAssembler is just an service which invokes a repository. I have not pasted the code of the service here. Repository: @Override
public Question findById(final int id, final FetchType fetchType) {

    final Auto question = getEntityManager().find(Auto.class, id);

    if (fetchType == FetchType.LAZY) {
        return auto;
    }

    Hibernate.initialize(auto.getManufacturer());
    Hibernate.initialize(auto.getAssemblyHouse());

    return auto;
}
 As you see, I provide both lazy and eager loading of objects. I use Hibernate.initialize to eager fetch JPA associations. However, the question is how I can fix the proxy error I am getting. Why come there is only AssemblyHouse that is still attached to JavaAssist, while Manufacturer is not (I have seen the type in Java Debugger). How do I know when to unproxy objects? Should I unproxy all associations this auto may have? And in which layer of my code? Does it affect the performance of my application when I unproxy? Are there other solutions? I see from the error message that I can make a type adapter. Yes, I could but then I have to do that for all domain objects to be sure that conversion is done correctly. Maybe other objects in my domain starts failing when I try to convert it into JSON representation too, but I don't know when or why. Is it just luck that the other objects are fine? This is the way I am unproxing objects, but I have not implemented it yet, because I don't know if this is good or bad, and in what layer to do this, and when I should do it. Should I unproxy objects all the time? public class HibernateUtilities {

    public static <T> T unproxy(T proxy) {
        if (proxy == null) {
            return null;
        }

        if (proxy instanceof HibernateProxy) {
            Hibernate.initialize(proxy);

            HibernateProxy hibernateProxy = (HibernateProxy) proxy;
            T unproxiedObject = (T) hibernateProxy.getHibernateLazyInitializer().getImplementation();

            return unproxiedObject;
        }

        return proxy;
    }
}

@TITLE:volatile boolean vs. AtomicBoolean
@CONTENT:I've looked at the other volatile vs. Atomicxxxx questions in SO (including this one) and have read the description of java.util.current.atomic, and am not quite satisfied with the nuances. If I'm trying to decide between using volatile boolean and AtomicBoolean, are there practical differences besides the atomic read-modify-write operations offered by AtomicBoolean? (e.g. compareAndSet() and getAndSet()) Suppose I have volatile boolean flag;
 Then one or more threads set the flag (but not clear it). If I have one thread that reads the flag, and if set, does an action, and then clears the flag, is volatile adequate? Is there a higher cost to AtomicBoolean than volatile boolean, in terms of memory space performance hit (volatile boolean appears to require memory fencing, AtomicBoolean appears to require memory fencing + some minor locking on CAS operations as per the java.util.current.atomic description) My gut call is to just go with AtomicBoolean and be safe, but I want to understand if there's ever a situation to use volatile boolean instead (e.g. if I had thousands of instances of them and performance were an issue).

@TITLE:Log4j: How to configure simplest possible file logging?
@CONTENT:My story: I want to make as a simple thing as a log4j logger that logs rows to a file. I have found several examples with some functionality, but not a basic one and not one with an explanation how the each row work. Question: Could anybody provide one? Prerequisites: I already know where to put the file and I have the log4j configured and working for console logging. Now I want to log to a file and also find the file from file system once the program has run. Rows needed to be added to the existing log4j.properties file are the desired output.

@TITLE:setuptools: package data folder location
@CONTENT:I use setuptools to distribute my python package. Now I need to distribute additional datafiles. From what I've gathered fromt the setuptools documentation, I need to have my data files inside the package directory. However, I would rather have my datafiles inside a subdirectory in the root directory. What I would like to avoid: / #root
|- src/
|  |- mypackage/
|  |  |- data/
|  |  |  |- resource1
|  |  |  |- [...]
|  |  |- __init__.py
|  |  |- [...]

 What I would like to have instead: / #root
|- data/
|  |- resource1
|  |- [...]
|- src/
|  |- mypackage/
|  |  |- __init__.py
|  |  |- [...]
|- setup.py
 I just don't feel comfortable with having so many subdirectories, if it's not essential. I fail to find a reason, why I /have/ to put the files inside the package directory. It is also cumbersome to work with so many nested subdirectories IMHO. Or is there any good reason that would justify this restriction?

I don't care so much about the performance of 0.1ms and I don't really feel like downloading and adding another library dependency for functionality that I already have. Are there examples of cases where the AntiXss implementation would prevent an attack that the HttpUtility implementation would not? If I continue to use the HttpUtility implementation, am I at risk?

@TITLE:File.listFiles() mangles unicode names with JDK 6 (Unicode Normalization issues)
@CONTENT:I'm struggling with a strange file name encoding issue when listing directory contents in Java 6 on both OS X and Linux: the File.listFiles() and related methods seem to return file names in a different encoding than the rest of the system. Note that it is not merely the display of these file names that is causing me problems. I'm mainly interested in doing a comparison of file names with a remote file storage system, so I care more about the content of the name strings than the character encoding used to print output. Here is a program to demonstrate. It creates a file with a Unicode name then prints out URL-encoded versions of the file names obtained from the directly-created File, and the same file when listed under a parent directory (you should run this code in an empty directory). The results show the different encoding returned by the File.listFiles() method. String fileName = "Tr?cky N?me";
File file = new File(fileName);
file.createNewFile();
System.out.println("File name: " + URLEncoder.encode(file.getName(), "UTF-8"));

// Get parent (current) dir and list file contents
File parentDir = file.getAbsoluteFile().getParentFile();
File[] children = parentDir.listFiles();
for (File child: children) {
    System.out.println("Listed name: " + URLEncoder.encode(child.getName(), "UTF-8"));

Maybe there's some hidden configuration setting somewhere? Or at least some way to do it as a post-build event maybe? For some background, the issue is that I'm using Spring.NET for dependency injection, etc, but it loads its singletons on Application Start, meaning that if I change any spring related code/configuration I have to stop the Development Server, so that it starts again next debug/run ensuring the Application Start event is triggered again. In other words, even if you change a bunch of code/config & then start debugging again, it doesn't actually start again, since its already running, so your new code isn't being used.

 But then one column failed to parse to an int... So I tried some simple code. The file is question is dead simple: $ cat info.csv 
startDate;treeDepth;nrMatchers;nrLines;nrChars;nrCodePoints;nrNodes
1422758875023;34;54;151;4375;4375;27486
$
 And the code is equally simple: public static void main(final String... args)
{
    final Path path = Paths.get("/home/fge/tmp/dd/info.csv");
    Files.lines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8).skip(1L).parallel()
        .forEach(System.out::println);
}
 And I systematically get the following result (OK, I have only run it something around 20 times): startDate;treeDepth;nrMatchers;nrLines;nrChars;nrCodePoints;nrNodes
 What am I missing here? EDIT It seems like the problem, or misunderstanding, is much more rooted than that (the two examples below were cooked up by a fellow on FreeNode's ##java): public static void main(final String... args)
{
    new BufferedReader(new StringReader("Hello\nWorld")).lines()
        .skip(1L).parallel()
        .forEach(System.out::println);

    final Iterator<String> iter
        = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World").iterator();
    final Spliterator<String> spliterator
        = Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize(iter, Spliterator.ORDERED);
    final Stream<String> s
        = StreamSupport.stream(spliterator, true);

    s.skip(1L).forEach(System.out::println);
}
 This prints: Hello
Hello
 Uh. @Holger suggested that this happens for any stream which is ORDERED and not SIZED with this other sample: Stream.of("Hello", "World")
    .filter(x -> true)
    .parallel()
    .skip(1L)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
 Also, it stems from all the discussion which already took place that the problem (if it is one?) is with .forEach() (as @SotiriosDelimanolis first pointed out).
@CODE:Files.lines() .skip() try (
    final Stream<String> stream = Files.lines(thePath, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
        .skip(1L).parallel();
) {
    // etc
} $ cat info.csv

@TITLE:Apply CSS style attribute dynamically in Angular JS
@CONTENT:This should be a simple problem, but I can't seem to find a solution. I have the following markup: <div style="width:20px; height:20px; margin-top:10px; border:solid 1px black; background-color:#ff0000;"></div>
 I need the background color to be bound to the scope, so I tried this: <div style="{width:20px; height:20px; margin-top:10px; border:solid 1px black; background-color:{{data.backgroundCol}};}"></div>
 That didn't work, so I did some research and found ng-style, but that didn't work, so I tried taking the dynamic part out and just hard-coding the style in ng-style, like this... <div ng-style="{width:20px; height:20px; margin-top:10px; border:solid 1px black; background-color:#ff0000;}"></div>
 and that doesn't even work. Am I misunderstanding how ng-style works? Is there a way of putting {{data.backgroundCol}} into a plain style attribute and getting it to insert the value?
@CODE:<div style="width:20px; height:20px; margin-top:10px; border:solid 1px black; background-color:#ff0000;"></div> <div style="{width:20px; height:20px; margin-top:10px; border:solid 1px black; background-color:{{data.backgroundCol}};}"></div> ng-style ng-style <div ng-style="{width:20px; height:20px; margin-top:10px; border:solid 1px black; background-color:#ff0000;}"></div> ng-style {{data.backgroundCol}}

@TITLE:Why does int*[] decay into int** but not int[][]?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand the nature of type-decay. For example, we all know arrays decay into pointers in a certain context. My attempt is to understand how int[] equates to int* but how two-dimensional arrays don't correspond to the expected pointer type. Here is a test case: std::is_same<int*, std::decay<int[]>::type>::value; // true
 This returns true as expected, but this doesn't: std::is_same<int**, std::decay<int[][1]>::type>::value; // false
 Why is this not true? I finally found a way to make it return true, and that was by making the first dimension a pointer: std::is_same<int**, std::decay<int*[]>::type>::value; // true
 And the assertion holds true for any type with pointers but with the last being the array. For example (int***[] == int****; // true). Can I have an explanation as to why this is happening? Why doesn't the array types correspond to the pointer types as would be expected?
@CODE:int[] int* std::is_same<int*, std::decay<int[]>::type>::value; // true std::is_same<int**, std::decay<int[][1]>::type>::value; // false std::is_same<int**, std::decay<int*[]>::type>::value; // true int***[] == int****; // true

@TITLE:ERROR: 'rake/rdoctask' is obsolete and no longer supported. Use 'rdoc/task' (available in RDoc 2.4.2+) instead
@CONTENT:Seems the last post for this problem was closed for one reason or another so I'll try my luck... I'm trying to run a simple "rake db:migrate" command. When I do, I get the error in the title. Yes, the solution "appears" obvious but it's not because I don't my Rakefile does not contain any references to 'rake/rdoctask'. It seems to be coming from documentation.rake but when I try to change that file as recommended by the error, I get a different error. I have found a couple of posts declaring this to be a known issue but nothing I've found indicates how to fix or work around this. Does anyone have any ideas how to fix it? Below is the output from the rake command with a --trace: $ rake --trace db:migrate

 I'm not sure what the error means but "gem list rack" shows I have both 1.4.1 and 1.4.0 installed. My Gemfile is pretty simple: gem 'rails', '3.2.9'

 Any thoughts?

@TITLE:Java: ExecutorService that blocks on submission after a certain queue size
@CONTENT:I am trying to code a solution in which a single thread produces I/O-intensive tasks that can be performed in parallel. Each task have significant in-memory data. So I want to be able limit the number of tasks that are pending at a moment. If I create ThreadPoolExecutor like this:     ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(numWorkerThreads, numWorkerThreads,
                                  0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
                                  new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(maxQueue));
 Then the executor.submit(callable) throws RejectedExecutionException when the queue fills up and all the threads are already busy. What can I do to make executor.submit(callable) block when the queue is full and all threads are busy? EDIT: I tried this: executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
 And it somewhat achieves the effect that I want achieved but in an inelegant way.
@CODE:ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(numWorkerThreads, numWorkerThreads,
                                  0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,

@TITLE:C++ try/throw/catch => machine code
@CONTENT:Mentally, I've always wondered how try/throw/catch looks behind the scenes, when the C++ compiles translates it to assembler. But since I never use it, I never got around to checking it out (some people would say lazy). Is the normal stack used for keeping track of trys, or is a separate per-thread stack kept for this purpose alone? Is the implementation between MSVC and g++ big or small? Please show me some pseudo asm (IA-32 is ok too) so I never have to check it out myself! :) Edit: Now I get the basics of MSVC's implementation on IA-32 handling. Anybody know for g++ on IA-32, or any other CPU for that matter?
