@TITLE:Social Objects - best practices for database structure, filtering, sorting, extensibility
@CONTENT:We're in the process of building a generic enterprise social networking platform in ASP.NET MVC. One of the key features of any social networking website are the social objects that are posted by users either explicitly (text updates, photos, blogs, videos etc) or implicitly ('user is attending event', 'user has updated page' etc). These are all essentially fairly similar - i.e. they are all displayed on users' activity streams, on the group pages that they are posted to, on the user profiles of users who posted them and filtered in similar ways - e.g. "show me everything that happened in the last 7 days for group X with the tag Y". We want to define a few core post types (blog, text update, event attendance, page edited etc) but to have the ability to easily extend so that resellers and clients of the software can add their own types (e.g. news-article) with their own custom metadata and fields (which should be searchable/filterable). Think of these as the "social" equivalent of Sharepoint lists! Anyway the question I have is: What is the best data structure to achieve this in terms of performance, scalability and ease of extensibility? This is what I'm currently thinking (pseudo code / database structure): public class SocialObject
{
 int Id;
 DateTime Date;
 string Url;
 string Title;
 string Text;

 Media[] Attachments; //photos, videos, links etc

 int OwnerId; //user who posted it
 int GroupId; //group it was posted to
 int PageId; //page it was posted to
 int PostTypeId;
 int? SourceId; //source - e.g. desktop client, email, web

 Like[] Likes;
 Comment[] Comments;
 Repost[] Reposts;

 Tag[] Tags;
 Mention[] Mentions; //user IDs mentioned in this post
 Metadata[] MetadataValues;
}

public class Metadata
{
 int SocialObjectId;
 int MetadataTypeId;
 int? MetadataValueId; //for metadata types with list values - for filtering
 string Value;
}
 (All arrays reference separate tables in the DB) Is this a sensible way to do it? - i.e. store all social objects in the same table (and allow extending via the metadata table for additional fields/info) or am I smoking something I shouldn't be? Bear in mind that this table is likely to become quite large - 100,000s to millions of rows. cheers, Marcus

@TITLE:Trying to use Grails Spring Security Plugin + Facebook Connect to automatically create a user with default permissions on Authentication
@CONTENT:I am working on an app that uses the Spring (Acegi) plugin for Grails. The plugin has facebook connect settings built in. I have followed the instructions to handle a facebook login within the app... however my knowledge of exactly whats going on is weak and what I really would like to do is give the user/visitor the option of either logging in and or registering on my app using their facebook account or create an account manually. I have roles that are setup in the app in the Spring Security plugin that are being bypassed using the facebook connect login option. Where can I intercept the login action in the Spring Security plugin to inject my own custom code to create the new user within the app if he/she doesnt exist. My hope is that if they choose to create an account using facebook.. my app will create a corresponding account for the facebook user with default permissions. When the person logs in, permissions are set and authentication is required to access certain content. I found a way of handling this using the Shiro Security plugin here: http://sacharya.com/facebook-connect-with-jsecurity-on-grails/ I also stumbled upon Nimble. However, I really like Spring Security, could just be a comfort thing and maybe its time for me to try Shiro with Nimble.. I dont know. I hope this makes sense. I appreciate any direction in making this happen. Best Mike

@TITLE:QTimer in a thread - events not processing?
@CONTENT:I have an object that is derived from QThread and the class definition includes the Q_OBJECT macro. I created a timer within the thread so I can do some occasional checks while the thread is running; however, the timeout event is never occurring. I've tried making the timer a singleshot as well, but no events are emitted. Are events processed in a thread by default or do I need to do something else to have them processed? Here's the code for how I set up the thread and timers: void MyClass::run( void ) 
{ 
    checkTimer_chA = new QTimer( this ); 

    qDebug() << connect( checkTimer_chA, SIGNAL( timeout() ), this, SLOT( timerExpiry_chA() ) ); 

    checkTimer_chA->start( 1000 ); 

    // prevent multiple, simultaneous starts 
    if( !isRunning ) 
    { 
        qDebug() << "Thread: MyClass::run"; 
        isRunning = true; 

        while( isRunning ) 
        { 
            getData(); 
            processData(); 
            yieldCurrentThread(); 
        } 
    } 

    checkTimer_chA->stop(); 

    delete checkTimer_chA; 
}


void DAQ::timerExpiry_chA( void )
{
    qDebug() << "timerExpiry_chA";
    checkTimer_chA->stop();
}
 If I add QApplication::processEvents(); right before the call to yieldCurrentThread(); the timer works as expected. However, this seems wrong to me.
@CODE:void MyClass::run( void ) 
{ 
    checkTimer_chA = new QTimer( this ); 

    qDebug() << connect( checkTimer_chA, SIGNAL( timeout() ), this, SLOT( timerExpiry_chA() ) ); 

    checkTimer_chA->start( 1000 ); 

    // prevent multiple, simultaneous starts 
    if( !isRunning ) 
    { 
        qDebug() << "Thread: MyClass::run"; 
        isRunning = true; 

        while( isRunning ) 
        { 
            getData(); 
            processData(); 
            yieldCurrentThread(); 
        } 
    } 

    checkTimer_chA->stop(); 

    delete checkTimer_chA; 
}

@TITLE:Simulating has_and_belongs_to_many nested through behavior in Rails 3
@CONTENT:So Rails doesn't have support for :through associations through a habtm relationship. There are plugins out there that will add this in for Rails 2.x, but I'm using Rails 3 / Edge, and only need the association for one particular model. So I thought I'd stump it out myself with the beauty that is Arel. First, the models: class CardSet < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :cards, :uniq => true
end

class Card < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :card_sets, :uniq => true
  has_many :learnings, :dependent => :destroy
end

class Learning < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :card
end
 I want to get all the learnings that belong to a particular card set, :through => cards. This is what I have so far in my CardSet model: def learnings
  c = Table(Card.table_name)
  l = Table(Learning.table_name)
  j = Table(self.class.send(:join_table_name, Card.table_name, CardSet.table_name))
  learning_sql = l.where(l[:card_id].eq(c[:id])).where(c[:id].eq(j[:card_id])).join(j).on(j[:card_set_id].eq(self.id)).to_sql
  Learning.find_by_sql(learning_sql)
end
 which gives me (damn, Arel is beautiful!): SELECT     `learnings`.`id`, `learnings`.`card_id`, `learnings`.`user_id`, `learnings`.`ef`, `learnings`.`times_seen`, `learnings`.`next_to_be_seen`, `learnings`.`interval`, `learnings`.`reps`, `learnings`.`created_at`, `learnings`.`updated_at`, `card_sets_cards`.`card_set_id`, `card_sets_cards`.`card_id` FROM       `learnings` INNER JOIN `card_sets_cards` ON `card_sets_cards`.`card_set_id` = 1 WHERE     `learnings`.`card_id` = `cards`.`id` AND `cards`.`id` = `card_sets_cards`.`card_id`
 which is oh so close to what I'm aiming for - just needs to add in the cards table in the FROM part of the statement. And there's my question: I've looked through the Arel source, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to add in another table. As a sidenote, is there a better way to run the result from Arel (which usually returns an Arel::Relation, which I don't want) through ActiveRecord, other than rendering to sql and running the query with find_by_sql as I'm doing?
@CODE:class CardSet < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :cards, :uniq => true
end

class Card < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :card_sets, :uniq => true
  has_many :learnings, :dependent => :destroy
end

class Learning < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :card
end def learnings
  c = Table(Card.table_name)
  l = Table(Learning.table_name)
  j = Table(self.class.send(:join_table_name, Card.table_name, CardSet.table_name))
  learning_sql = l.where(l[:card_id].eq(c[:id])).where(c[:id].eq(j[:card_id])).join(j).on(j[:card_set_id].eq(self.id)).to_sql
  Learning.find_by_sql(learning_sql)
end SELECT     `learnings`.`id`, `learnings`.`card_id`, `learnings`.`user_id`, `learnings`.`ef`, `learnings`.`times_seen`, `learnings`.`next_to_be_seen`, `learnings`.`interval`, `learnings`.`reps`, `learnings`.`created_at`, `learnings`.`updated_at`, `card_sets_cards`.`card_set_id`, `card_sets_cards`.`card_id` FROM       `learnings` INNER JOIN `card_sets_cards` ON `card_sets_cards`.`card_set_id` = 1 WHERE     `learnings`.`card_id` = `cards`.`id` AND `cards`.`id` = `card_sets_cards`.`card_id` cards

@LINK:/questions/3367922/dragable-objects-in-wpf-in-an-itemscontrol
@TITLE:Dragable objects in WPF in an ItemsControl?
@CONTENT:I want to be able to implement an ItemsControl with dragable items. The reason for the ItemsControl is so I can bind to my ViewModel in the background. I've tried using a Thumb Control in a canvas and it works perfect, except as soon as I stick it in an ItemsControl it stops working. Here is what I tried:         <ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding MyItems}">
        <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
            <DataTemplate>
                <Thumb Canvas.Left="0" Canvas.Top="0" Width="50" Height="50" DragDelta="MyThumb_DragDelta"/>
            </DataTemplate>
        </ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
        <ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>
            <ItemsPanelTemplate>
                <Canvas />
            </ItemsPanelTemplate>
        </ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>

    </ItemsControl>
 The code behind:     public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        DataContext = new MainViewModel();
    }

    private void MyThumb_DragDelta(object sender, System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.DragDeltaEventArgs e)
    {
        Canvas.SetLeft((UIElement)sender, Canvas.GetLeft((UIElement)sender) + e.HorizontalChange);
        Canvas.SetTop((UIElement)sender, Canvas.GetTop((UIElement)sender) + e.VerticalChange);
    }
 And finally my ViewModel:     public class MainViewModel : DependencyObject 
{
    public ObservableCollection<Note> MyItems { get; set;}


    public MainViewModel()
    {
        MyItems = new ObservableCollection<Note>();
        MyItems.Add(new Note(){Name="test"});
    }

}

public class Note : INotifyPropertyChanged 
{
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set
        {
            name = value;
            if(PropertyChanged!=null) PropertyChanged(this,new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Name"));
        }
    }


}
 When I do the following on the window it works fine:   <Canvas>
        <Thumb Canvas.Left="0" Canvas.Top="0" Width="50" Height="50" DragDelta="MyThumb_DragDelta"/>            
    </Canvas>
 But when I have it in an ItemsControl it no longer works. I assume the ItemsControl is Registering for mouse events and overriding the Thumb? Anyone have a good solution to get getting this working?
@CODE:<ItemsControl ItemsSource="{Binding MyItems}">
        <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
            <DataTemplate>
                <Thumb Canvas.Left="0" Canvas.Top="0" Width="50" Height="50" DragDelta="MyThumb_DragDelta"/>
            </DataTemplate>
        </ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
        <ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>
            <ItemsPanelTemplate>
                <Canvas />
            </ItemsPanelTemplate>
        </ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>

    </ItemsControl> public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        DataContext = new MainViewModel();
    }

    private void MyThumb_DragDelta(object sender, System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.DragDeltaEventArgs e)
    {
        Canvas.SetLeft((UIElement)sender, Canvas.GetLeft((UIElement)sender) + e.HorizontalChange);
        Canvas.SetTop((UIElement)sender, Canvas.GetTop((UIElement)sender) + e.VerticalChange);
    } public class MainViewModel : DependencyObject 
{
    public ObservableCollection<Note> MyItems { get; set;}


    public MainViewModel()
    {
        MyItems = new ObservableCollection<Note>();
        MyItems.Add(new Note(){Name="test"});
    }

}

public class Note : INotifyPropertyChanged 
{
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set
        {
            name = value;
            if(PropertyChanged!=null) PropertyChanged(this,new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Name"));
        }
    }


} <Canvas>
        <Thumb Canvas.Left="0" Canvas.Top="0" Width="50" Height="50" DragDelta="MyThumb_DragDelta"/>

@TITLE:Add parameters to Apache HttpPost
@CONTENT:I'm trying to send a file to a Servlet. Along with this file, I also have to send some parameters (i.e. name/id, date and a few others). I'm using HttpClient on client-side and ServerFileUpload on server-side. This is the client-side code: ... String url = "http://localhost:8080/RicezioneServlet/RicezioneServlet";
HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpPost postMethod = new HttpPost(url);
MultipartEntity mpe = new MultipartEntity();
//I'm sending a .zip file
ContentBody cb = new FileBody(fileToSend,"application/zip");
mpe.addPart("file", cb);
postMethod.setEntity(mpe);
HttpResponse resp = httpclient.execute(postMethod);
HttpEntity respEntity = resp.getEntity();
System.out.println(resp.getStatusLine());
 ... on the server side, we've got: ServletFileUpload sup = new ServletFileUpload();
FileItemIterator it = sup.getItemIterator(request);
FileItemStream item = it.next();
InputStream ios = item.openStream();
//read from ios and write to a fileoutputstream.
 Now, I don't know how to add the aforementioned parameters to the request... I tried to use a StringBody and to add it to the MultiPartEntity, but I get a NullPointerException at: String author = request.getParameter("author");
 which means that the parameter isn't seen as a parameter, maybe? The only was I got it working was setting these parameters as Headers (setHeader and getHeader), but this is not an option. Any advice? Or maybe can you redirect me to a full example of file+parameter upload? Thanks, Alex

@CONTENT:Suppose you have a COM interface ICOMInterface that is implemented by coclasses Coclass1 and Coclass2. Neither of these coclasses have interfaces of their own (for simplicity's sake and to illustrate my issue). In C#, you can create an instance of a COM interface from a coclass like so: ICOMInterface myComInterface = new Coclass1();
 Now, how can you determine whether myComInterface was instantiated by Coclass1 or Coclass2? Using the "is" statement like follows always returns true, and as such is useless for this purpose. Debug.WriteLine(myComInterface is Coclass1) // writes "True"
Debug.WriteLine(myComInterface is Coclass2) // writes "True"
 This would work if I was testing interfaces, not coclasses, but these coclasses do not have interfaces other than the one they both implement, ICOMInterface.

What's a good way to break it up into files each containing just one variable in Python? Is this solution going to be robust? E.g. what if the input file is 100G in size? I am trying to perform a divide conquer strategy but is new to Python. Thanks in advance for your help! The input files looks like var1,var2,var3
1,2,hello
2,5,yay
...
 I want to create 3 (or however many variables) files var1.csv, var2.csv, var3.csv so that files resemble File1 var1
1
2
...
 File2 var2
2
5
...
 File3 var3
hello
yay
@CODE:var1,var2,var3
1,2,hello
2,5,yay
... var1
1
2
... var2
2

... var3
hello

@TITLE:PHP 5 - Securing an admin area of a site
@CONTENT:I'm currently writing a couple of MVC sites using Kohana as my framework. Each has a simple admin area where the admin can upload and edit content. I'm currently storing the admin's user model in a session and checking whether or not they're an administrator with the following method: private function checkAdmin()
{
    if (!isset($_SESSION['admin']) || $_SESSION['admin']->Level !== 'admin')
    {
        header('Location: /admin');
        exit;
    }
}
 I call this method in all of the other Admin controller methods, like so: public function writeReview()
{
    $this->checkAdmin();

    // rest of the method
}
 I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do to improve this. It just seems like a single point of failure that's giving me a bad smell, so I'm a bit weary to move on before getting this nailed down.

@TITLE:Rails route to model instance - by domain name
@CONTENT:I have a Rails 3 application, say, with hotels, where hotels belong to parent areas. When a user hits the app (served by mongrel >> nginx), I want the domain name used in the request to decide what area of hotels to serve up (domain name >> area). To achieve this I can see two options: 1) Rewrite the URL with nginx, inserting the area id after the domain name (e.g. birminghamhotels.co.uk => proxy_pass http://myupstream/areas/3$request_uri). Benefits: Domain to object mapping happens where accepted domains are defined: nginx.conf. Should be transparent to users (pretty URLs possible as they are rewritten). Drawbacks: Breaks Rails url helpers, no more link_to or form_for. Hard-coded object reference is naughty. 2) Catch the domain name in routes.rb and look up the Area via a unique "domain" attribute for each Area (or even a has_many if you fancy). Benefits: Should allow use of all Rails URL helpers. Requested domain linked directly to resource so exceptions can be handled. Drawbacks: Without rewriting URLs with nginx, wouldn't users see: birminghamhotels.co.uk/areas/3/hotels/42 instead of just birminghamhotels.co.uk/hotels/42? Also, I don't have a clue how to do it! So, I've tried option #1 but ran into trouble with URL helpers etc. I've tried to come up with a way of trying option #2 but haven't been able to suss the correct syntax despite a lot of ogling. Now the fact I cannot find any answers by searching makes me think I got the wrong end of this problem. Is there a third option? How would you solve it? Oh and btw, I am not building another hotel listing website - plenty enough of those around already. Just happened to be a close enough example.

@TITLE:Rational Functional Tester - How can I get scripts called from a parent script to use the parent's data pool?
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to Rational Functional Tester (Java) but I have one large blank. I have an application that is in an agile development environment so some of the screens can flux as new interfaces are brought online. For this reason I'm trying to modularize my test scripts. For example: I would like to have a login script, a search script, and a logout script. I would then stitch these together (pseudo code) Call Script components.security.Login;
Call Script components.search.Search;
//verification point
Call Script components.security.Logout;
 By breaking the testing script into discrete chunks (functional units) I believe that I would be better able to adapt to change. If the login script changed, I would fix or re-record it once for every script in the application. Then I would call that script, say, "TestSituation_001". It would have need to refer to several different data pools. In this instance a User datapool (instead of a superUser datapool) and a TestSituation_001 datapool, or possibly some other datapools as well. The verfication point would use the situational datapool for its check. Now, this is how I would do it in an ideal world. What is bothering me at the moment is that it appears that I would need to do something entirely different in order to get the child scripts to inherit the parents. So my questions are these: Why don't child scripts just inherit the calling script's data pool? How can I make them do it? Am I making poor assumptions about the way this should work? If #3 is true, then how can I do better? As a side note, I don't mind hacking the heck out of some Java to make it work. Thanks!

@TITLE:Update title/subtitle for custom annotation on an MKMapView
@CONTENT:I created a custom annotation to display my data. The data comes from moving vehicles and I've got to update their location on the map as well as their title (it shows the last update time). My first approach was to simply remove all annotations and recreate them. However this leads to a lot of horrible flickering (the map clears, and then all annotations appear again) and the map blocks while it redraws. Less than optimal solution. In the OS4 SDK they improved the MKMapViewAnnotation and I can now set the coordinates (they were readonly before). Changing the coordinates moves the view nicely where it should be without any flickering. That solved one of my issues. It said in the API documentation that changing the title of the MKAnnotation will update the MKAnnotationView. Indeed that's the case for the MKPinView. If I update the MKAnnotation's coordinates and title, the pin moves and shows the new data. How can I achieve the same result using my custom MKAnnotationView? I can't see any way to ask the view to refresh. I tried calling setNeedsLayout on the MKAnnotationView but that only resulted in the view disappearing. Cheers.

 My backup servers may be mirrors to this server, or keep the backed up data in archives or whatever. I suppose I can do something like: git clone --bare ssh://gitserver/~user/git/projectX.git
 Or maybe: $ cd ~/git/project1.git
$ git bundle create ~/gitbackup/project1.bdl --all
 and then copy all bundles from all projects to my backup servers.

@TITLE:Importing csv file into postgres
@CONTENT:Using Mysql Administrator GUI tool - I have exported some data tables retrieved from an sql dumpfile into csv files. I then tried to import these csv files into a postgres database using the postgres COPY command. I've tried entering "COPY articles FROM '[insert .csv dir here]' DELIMITERS ',' CSV;" and also the same command without the delimiters part. I get an error saying "ERROR:invalid input syntax for integer: "id"" and "CONTEXT: COPY articles, line 1, column id: "id" In conclusion my question is what are some thoughts and solutions to this problem? Could it possibly be something to do with the way I created the csv files? or have I made a rookie mistake elsewhere?

@TITLE:new to multithreading- how to use wait() and notify() in java?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a program with 2 classes, a controller and a class that does a lot of computation. The controller creates a couple instances of the other class, then tells them all to start their calculations (in parallel). They each return when they are finished, and the controller resumes, and then, some time later, the controller passes them new data, and has them run the calculation again. Ideally, I would be able to call start() with parameters, but that isn't possible, so the controller calls a method in the calculator that stores the data in a global, and then starts the calculation thread and returns, which works until I try to start the thread again, and it tells me the thread is dead. So I'm trying to make the run an infinite loop that just waits until it is notified, runs the calculations, stores the results in a global so the controller can retrieve them later, then resumes waiting. So something like: //in controller:
Calculator calc=new Calculator();
calc.runCalculations(data);
while(calc.isCalculating()){
    //do nothing
}
System.out.println("results: "+calc.getAnswer());
calc.runCalculations(data2);

//in calculator:
public runCalculations(Data data){
    globalData=data;
    this.notify();
}
public void run(){
    while(true){
        synchronized(this){
            wait();
        }
        calculating=true;
        globalData=calculate(globalData);
        calculating=false;
    }
}
@CODE://in controller:

calc.runCalculations(data);

@LINK:/questions/3275100/jpa-and-unique-fields
@TITLE:JPA and unique fields
@CONTENT:I have two persistence objects in my app: Things and tags attached to things. The app can generate collections of things with tags attached. Tag objects have a unique name (it doesn't make sense to tag something twice with the same tag). When inserting a Thing (with tag objects attached) some of these tag objects with the same name maybe already exist in the db. Now here is the part I don't recall about JPA, is there a way to tell JPA that it should not try to add the corresponding objects to the db if it violates the unique constraint? Or is there a way to do this efficiently w/o having to first fetch all objects, then merge the collection in memory and then write everything back? I'm also wondering if it's possible to persist a whole collection at once or do I have to call persist for every object when using JPA?

  User user = new User();
  user = transformXmlToObject(xml, user);

  // object filled

@TITLE:Linq and SubSonic - returning nested complex types
@CONTENT:I'm new to SubSonic and reasonably new to LINQ as well, so I'm just trying to put a little app together. I've got the templates all sorted and running okay, but I've run into a bit of trouble with this LINQ statement (simplified slightly, the real statement has some other joins but they don't affect this particular problem so I've removed them for brevity): var addresses = from address in Database.Addresses.All()
                           select new Address()
                               {
                                   MyNestedType = new NestedType()
                                       {
                                           Field1 = address.ADDR1
                                       }
                               };
 If I execute this statement I get the error Invalid cast from 'System.String' to 'NestedType'. when I try to enumerate the results. I'm probably overlooking the obvious but I can't see anywhere that I request such a conversion. Both Field1 and address.ADDR1 are strings. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Edit: I've had another look at this and in an effort to provide more information, I've created a small, complete example using SimpleRepository and an SQLite database that demonstrates the issue. Using SimpleRepository the error I get is different (Sequence contains no elements) but the result is the same. Here's the complete code:  public class DatabaseAddress
 {
     public int Id { get; set; }
     public string Address1 { get; set; }
 }

 public class Address
 {
     public NestedType MyNestedType;
 }

 public class NestedType
 {
     public string Field1 { get; set; }
 }

 static class Program
 {
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
         var repo = new SimpleRepository("Db", SimpleRepositoryOptions.RunMigrations);
         DatabaseAddress address1 = new DatabaseAddress();
         address1.Address1 = "Test";
         repo.Add(address1);
         var all = repo.All<DatabaseAddress>();
         var addresses = from address in repo.All<DatabaseAddress>()
                         select new Address { MyNestedType = new NestedType { Field1 = address.Address1 } };
    }
 }
 In this example, all contains the object added to the database, but addresses returns "Sequence contains no elements". If I use anonymous types instead of concrete types in the select statement it works. There's obviously a gap in my knowledge here; any help appreciated.
@CODE:var addresses = from address in Database.Addresses.All()
                           select new Address()
                               {
                                   MyNestedType = new NestedType()

The reason i'm doing this because it is for Android, and gdata-java library doesn't really work and the alpha android one doesn't really cut it.

@TITLE:Displaying custom error page in PHP for errors which can't be caught by set_error_handler
@CONTENT:I would like to be able to discard a partially rendered page and show an error page in PHP. I already know about set_error_handler(), but it can only trap certain types of errors. I would like to know how to show an error page when an error type which can't be trapped by set_error_handler() is raised. Unfortunately, it seems that the following code, when run with PHP 5.3.2 on Apache 2.2, doesn't do what I would expect it to do: <?php

// Start the output buffer
ob_start();

// Output something into the buffer.
// I only want this to be displayed if I call one of the 
// ob_flush functions or echo the buffer myself later.
echo "yep";

// Call a function I know not to exist in order to raise 
// an error which cannot be trapped by set_error_handler() 
// and would, if display_errors was On, output "Fatal 
// error: Call to undefined function fwee()..." 
function_which_does_not_exist();

// This will never be executed.
$out = ob_get_clean();
 The output of the script is: yep
 Whereas I would expect it to output nothing (or spew error info and only error info if display_errors() is on). I have confirmed using LiveHTTPHeaders that PHP 5.3.2 does send a 500 error to the browser when display_errors is off (and a 200 when it's on) using the version of apache supplied by MacPorts, but it only ever spits 200s when using PHP 5.3.1 on XAMPP. I tried setting ErrorDocument 500 "test" in the apache configuration (confirmed to be working by doing the same for 404) but PHP never shows the custom error, even when the entire contents of the script is just header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error'); I'm not sure what else to do to make sure a partially rendered page is replaced with a simple error. I can also confirm that this happens in the Yii framework. If I edit the view for the "about" page in the blog demo to have a line which reads <?php echo function_which_does_not_exist() ?>, I get a partially rendered page.
@CODE:<?php

// Start the output buffer
ob_start();

// Output something into the buffer.
// I only want this to be displayed if I call one of the 
// ob_flush functions or echo the buffer myself later.

@TITLE:Execute external program using ProcessBuilder and provide input
@CONTENT:I'm trying to execute an external program with Java using ProcessBuilder, but it expects a input from the user. To be more specific, the program is psql (Postgres SQL), when it's executed the program prompts the user for a password. The only way to bypass that is to save a file in the user home containing the passwords, I'm trying to avoid that, so I want to execute the program from Java and send the password using the process' output stream. The code works fine when the program doesn't expect any user input, but when I delete the password file from the user home, the program hangs. I see that it's being executed, but nothing happens. If I debugg it, it reaches the while and then nothing happens until I kill the process. This is the code, any help will be greatly appreciated. @Test

@CONTENT:I've just read this interesting article regarding simultaneously calling multiple methods on a WCF service from Silverlight: http://weblogs.asp.net/olakarlsson/archive/2010/05/20/simultaneously-calling-multiple-methods-on-a-wcf-service-from-silverlight.aspx The article states: "It turns out that the issue is founded in a mix of Silverlight, Asp.Net and WCF, basically if you¡¦re doing multiple calls to a single WCF web-service and you have Asp.Net session state enabled, the calls will be executed sequentially by the service, hence any long running calls will block subsequent ones." I am assuming that the blocking is only an issue if you are making multiple calls to the same service, and that two simultaneous calls to two different methods on two different services should not result in one blocking the other? The suggested solution to the problem in SL3 involves using the following syntax in the Application_Startup method: WebRequest.RegisterPrefix("http://", WebRequestCreator.ClientHttp); The session state will then have to be maintained on WCF calls by seting up a cookie container, and sharing it across all of your proxies (see http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/174322/393032.aspx) Is this still the recommended solution in Silverlight 4? Has anyone used an alternative approach?

@TITLE:Blackberry encode MD5 different from MD5 in C#
@CONTENT:I have my passwords encoded in MD5 in C# and inserted in my DB. MD5 MD5Hasher = MD5.Create();
byte[] PasswordHash = MD5Hasher.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(PasswordText.Value));
 PasswordHash is inserted as is and look like 0x09C09E5B52580E477514FA.......... for example. In the blackberry app, I get the password, want to encode it to pass it to a web service that will compare both hashed password. The problem is my result is different from the MD5 I create in my Blackberry app. password = Crypto.encodeStringMD5(password);
 Then below my function:     public static String encodeStringMD5(String s) throws Exception {
    byte[] bytes = s.getBytes();
    MD5Digest digest = new MD5Digest();
    digest.update(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
    int length = digest.getDigestLength();
    byte[] md5 = new byte[length];
    digest.getDigest(md5, 0, true);
    return convertToHex(md5);
}

private static String convertToHex(byte[] data) {
    StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        int halfbyte = (data[i] >>> 4) & 0x0F;
        int two_halfs = 0;
        do {
            if ((0 <= halfbyte) && (halfbyte <= 9))
                buf.append((char) ('0' + halfbyte));
            else
                buf.append((char) ('a' + (halfbyte - 10)));
            halfbyte = data[i] & 0x0F;
        } while(two_halfs++ < 1);
    }
    return buf.toString();
}
 So it returns something like this: 07054da3aea1cc98377fe0.......... Any idea how I can get the same hashed password that I create with my C# function in the Blackberry? Thank you!
@CODE:MD5 MD5Hasher = MD5.Create();

    digest.update(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
    int length = digest.getDigestLength();
    byte[] md5 = new byte[length];
    digest.getDigest(md5, 0, true);
    return convertToHex(md5);
}

@TITLE:Displaying custom error page in PHP for errors which can't be caught by set_error_handler
@CONTENT:I would like to be able to discard a partially rendered page and show an error page in PHP. I already know about set_error_handler(), but it can only trap certain types of errors. I would like to know how to show an error page when an error type which can't be trapped by set_error_handler() is raised. Unfortunately, it seems that the following code, when run with PHP 5.3.2 on Apache 2.2, doesn't do what I would expect it to do: <?php

// Start the output buffer
ob_start();

// Output something into the buffer.
// I only want this to be displayed if I call one of the 
// ob_flush functions or echo the buffer myself later.
echo "yep";

// Call a function I know not to exist in order to raise 
// an error which cannot be trapped by set_error_handler() 
// and would, if display_errors was On, output "Fatal 
// error: Call to undefined function fwee()..." 
function_which_does_not_exist();

// This will never be executed.
$out = ob_get_clean();
 The output of the script is: yep
 Whereas I would expect it to output nothing (or spew error info and only error info if display_errors() is on). I have confirmed using LiveHTTPHeaders that PHP 5.3.2 does send a 500 error to the browser when display_errors is off (and a 200 when it's on) using the version of apache supplied by MacPorts, but it only ever spits 200s when using PHP 5.3.1 on XAMPP. I tried setting ErrorDocument 500 "test" in the apache configuration (confirmed to be working by doing the same for 404) but PHP never shows the custom error, even when the entire contents of the script is just header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error'); I'm not sure what else to do to make sure a partially rendered page is replaced with a simple error. I can also confirm that this happens in the Yii framework. If I edit the view for the "about" page in the blog demo to have a line which reads <?php echo function_which_does_not_exist() ?>, I get a partially rendered page.
@CODE:<?php

// Start the output buffer
ob_start();

// Output something into the buffer.
// I only want this to be displayed if I call one of the 
// ob_flush functions or echo the buffer myself later.

@TITLE:Execute external program using ProcessBuilder and provide input
@CONTENT:I'm trying to execute an external program with Java using ProcessBuilder, but it expects a input from the user. To be more specific, the program is psql (Postgres SQL), when it's executed the program prompts the user for a password. The only way to bypass that is to save a file in the user home containing the passwords, I'm trying to avoid that, so I want to execute the program from Java and send the password using the process' output stream. The code works fine when the program doesn't expect any user input, but when I delete the password file from the user home, the program hangs. I see that it's being executed, but nothing happens. If I debugg it, it reaches the while and then nothing happens until I kill the process. This is the code, any help will be greatly appreciated. @Test

@CONTENT:I've just read this interesting article regarding simultaneously calling multiple methods on a WCF service from Silverlight: http://weblogs.asp.net/olakarlsson/archive/2010/05/20/simultaneously-calling-multiple-methods-on-a-wcf-service-from-silverlight.aspx The article states: "It turns out that the issue is founded in a mix of Silverlight, Asp.Net and WCF, basically if you¡¦re doing multiple calls to a single WCF web-service and you have Asp.Net session state enabled, the calls will be executed sequentially by the service, hence any long running calls will block subsequent ones." I am assuming that the blocking is only an issue if you are making multiple calls to the same service, and that two simultaneous calls to two different methods on two different services should not result in one blocking the other? The suggested solution to the problem in SL3 involves using the following syntax in the Application_Startup method: WebRequest.RegisterPrefix("http://", WebRequestCreator.ClientHttp); The session state will then have to be maintained on WCF calls by seting up a cookie container, and sharing it across all of your proxies (see http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/174322/393032.aspx) Is this still the recommended solution in Silverlight 4? Has anyone used an alternative approach?

@TITLE:Blackberry encode MD5 different from MD5 in C#
@CONTENT:I have my passwords encoded in MD5 in C# and inserted in my DB. MD5 MD5Hasher = MD5.Create();
byte[] PasswordHash = MD5Hasher.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(PasswordText.Value));
 PasswordHash is inserted as is and look like 0x09C09E5B52580E477514FA.......... for example. In the blackberry app, I get the password, want to encode it to pass it to a web service that will compare both hashed password. The problem is my result is different from the MD5 I create in my Blackberry app. password = Crypto.encodeStringMD5(password);
 Then below my function:     public static String encodeStringMD5(String s) throws Exception {
    byte[] bytes = s.getBytes();
    MD5Digest digest = new MD5Digest();
    digest.update(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
    int length = digest.getDigestLength();
    byte[] md5 = new byte[length];
    digest.getDigest(md5, 0, true);
    return convertToHex(md5);
}

private static String convertToHex(byte[] data) {
    StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer();
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        int halfbyte = (data[i] >>> 4) & 0x0F;
        int two_halfs = 0;
        do {
            if ((0 <= halfbyte) && (halfbyte <= 9))
                buf.append((char) ('0' + halfbyte));
            else
                buf.append((char) ('a' + (halfbyte - 10)));
            halfbyte = data[i] & 0x0F;
        } while(two_halfs++ < 1);
    }
    return buf.toString();
}
 So it returns something like this: 07054da3aea1cc98377fe0.......... Any idea how I can get the same hashed password that I create with my C# function in the Blackberry? Thank you!
@CODE:MD5 MD5Hasher = MD5.Create();

    digest.update(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
    int length = digest.getDigestLength();
    byte[] md5 = new byte[length];
    digest.getDigest(md5, 0, true);
    return convertToHex(md5);
}

I think that a lot of dev's like me have maybe a lack of photoshop skills and "ergonomy" ( does this word exist in english?). I have read also on Twitter Blog that the application would be Open source: http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-android-robots-like-to.html But I havn't heard about any code release. As there are to many things to care, regarding to the Google dev blog, I would like to know if there is an open source application that could learn me how to use all these pattern ( search bar, moving bitmaps, QuickActions, etc.) I know that the answer to my question is not a simple line of code, but maybe an open source project or reference application to learn how to do the UI tricks as simple as they are on the Twitter app. Thank a lot for any guide/blog/code sample.

@LINK:/questions/3214023/ajax-get-race-condition
@TITLE:AJAX GET race condition?
@CONTENT:I am attempting to track events when links are clicked on my site in a method similar to the following. <a href="/example" class="track">Example</a>

<script type="text/javascript">
    jQuery(function($) {
        // track clicks on all anchor tags that require it
        $('a.track').live('click', function(e) {
            // send an AJAX request to our event tracking URL for the server to track it
            $.get('/events/track', {
                    url: $(this).attr('href'),
                    text: $(this).text()
            });
        });
    });
</script>
 The problem that I'm having is that a new page load interrupts the AJAX request, and so sometimes these events aren't being tracked. I know Google Analytics has a _trackPageview function that can be attached to onclick events though, and this doesn't seem to be an issue for that. I'm wondering what's different about their call vs. mine that I'm seeing this race condition, and GA isn't. e.g.: <a href="/example" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/click/example');">Example</a>
 Note that I'm not worried about the result of the AJAX request...I simply want it to ping the server with the fact that an event happened. (Also, I expect I'll get at least one answer that says to simply track the new page load from the server side, not the client side. This is not an acceptable answer for this question. I'm looking for something like how Google Analytics' trackPageview function works on the click event of anchor tags regardless of a new page being loaded.)

@TITLE:Static library dependency compiles in simulator on Xcode 3.2.3, fails on device
@CONTENT:Upgrading to XCode 3.2.3 and iPhone 3.2/4.0 SDK has introduced a strange bug into my build process. I have a static library, Compton, which itself depends on three20. I build Compton as a dependency of the client apps that it powers. When I compile Compton as its own project in either simulator or device mode, 3.2 or 4.0 SDK, everything compiles fine, no errors. When I compile a client app that references Compton using the 3.2 or 4.0 SDK, simulator, targeting the iPhone or iPhone / iPad on 3.2, everything works great, no compile errors, and the app runs as expected in the simulator. When I compile the exact same project changing nothing except the build settings from simulator to device, however, I get the following linking errors that I cannot seem to banish after hours of messing with #import statements, search paths, build settings, etc. The part I'm really frustrated with is that the simulator versions are building and running fine, it seems like a tiny little config problem. I'm pasting the errors below, it looks like the Compton classes, from the perspective of building my project in device mode, can't "see" some of the three20 headers. I'm using the trunk version of three20, pulled today. Here is the output from the linking errors: Ld build/NewBlankComptonTemplate.build/Debug-iphoneos/NewBlankComptonTemplate.build/Objects-normal/armv7/NewBlankComptonTemplate normal armv7

 Can anyone help me figure out what may be going wrong here? Update: I've eliminated the duplicate symbol linking error by using the fork of three20 and process described here and removing the -all_load linker flag on three20 and Compton. The really crazy problem that I'm stuck on remains: I can compile and run the app fine in the simulator, but when compiling for the device, I get the above linking errors. Update 2: I've resolved the issue, added an answer and accepted it. The problem was indeed a build config setting - if you're using the 4.0 SDK, you need to set "Architectures" to "Optimized (armv7)".

@TITLE:After Deploying ASP.NET 4 web application to IIS6 server, worker process recycles cause it to stop working most of the time
@CONTENT:This is a really odd situation, so hopefully I can explain it well enough. I am deploying an ASP.NET 4 webforms application to a Windows Server 2003 SP2 server running IIS6. Here's the problem -- when the application pool recycles its worker process (w3wp.exe), about 80% of the time, I will get an ReflectionTypeLoadException error trying to access any page in the app that contains an EntityDataSoure every time I try to view it. However (this is the interesting part) -- the other 20%, it works just fine. I've actually resorted to turning off recycling the worker process entirely for this application pool and just add/remove whitespace from web.config forcing the site to recompile until I get a "good" w3wp.exe. If this isn't clear, what I'm saying is: the actual worker process doesn't work at all for pages containing an EntityDataSource for about 4/5 times it starts, but still manages to serve all other pages just fine. Once you get a worker process that manages to serve a page with an EntityDataSource, it works every time until that process gets recycled. My question is, how can I debug this? It works fine on my dev machine, it works fine on the server as long as you get a good process running, but iisreset or a server restart or anything that kills the worker process is almost guaranteed to cause the site to not come back up and throw this ReflectionTypeLoadException. Here is the compilation section of my web.config: <compilation debug="false" targetFramework="4.0">

@TITLE:Cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects
@CONTENT:I'm getting a TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects. I'm trying to pass an object from a list to create a new variable by concatenating it with another variable. Example: I want to take the value from the group list and concatenate it with "All.dbf" so it will do something with that file for each value in my list. If working properly, it would set the value for dbname equal to AdministrativeAll.dbf, CadastralAll.dbf and PlanimetericAll.dbf respectively each time it runs through but I am getting the 'str' and 'list' error.... group = ['Administrative', 'Cadastral', 'Planimetric']

for i in group:
    dbname = i + "All.dbf"

    blah, blah, blah....
 I suppose I could add the "All.dbf" onto the values in the group list but thought there must be a better way to process this with a function or something that I don't know about....any thoughts?? Cheers
@CODE:group = ['Administrative', 'Cadastral', 'Planimetric']

@CONTENT:I have been trying to move away from using DECODE to pivot rows in Oracle 11g, where there is a handy PIVOT function. But I may have found a limitation: I'm trying to return 2 columns for each value in the base table. Something like: SELECT somethingId, splitId1, splitName1, splitId2, splitName2
FROM (SELECT somethingId, splitId
      FROM SOMETHING JOIN SPLIT ON ... )
      PIVOT ( MAX(splitId) FOR displayOrder IN (1 AS splitId1, 2 AS splitId2),

            )
 I can do this with DECODE, but I can't wrestle the syntax to let me do it with PIVOT. Is this even possible? Seems like it wouldn't be too hard for the function to handle. Edit: is StackOverflow maybe not the right Overflow for SQL questions? Edit: anyone out there?

@TITLE:SWT tree: auto resize all columns
@CONTENT:In a tree with multiple columns, how do I resize columns to contents upon expand/collapse and data updates? The solution to the similar question for tables doesn't work. Same as   tree.addListener(SWT.Collapse, new Listener(){
   @Override
   public void handleEvent(Event e) {
    expandAndResize(false, (TreeItem) e.item);
   }
  });

  tree.addListener(SWT.Expand, new Listener() {
   @Override
   public void handleEvent(Event event) {
    expandAndResize(false, (TreeItem) event.item);
   }
  });

 private static void expandAndResize(Boolean expand_, TreeItem item_)
 {
  System.out.println( (expand_?"Expanding":"Collapsing") + "item={" + item_ + "}");
  item_.setExpanded(expand_);
  System.out.println(" Resizing columns");
  resizeTree(item_.getParent());
 }

 private static void resizeTree(Tree tree_)
 {
  for (TreeColumn tc: tree_.getColumns())
   resizeTreeColumn(tc);
 }

 private static void resizeTreeColumn(TreeColumn treeColumn_)
 {
  treeColumn_.pack();  
 }
 This works for data updates (by calling the resizeTree), but for expands/collapses it is one step behind! More specifically, if I expand an item in the first column, and the underlying item is longer than the column width, the resize to that width will be done upon a next collapse or expand of some other item (or if I directly call resizeTree()). Just in case it is important: the data is given by TreeContentProvider and ITableLabelProvider, and my guess is that ITableLabelProvider might cause the problem (the width of the column is adjusted before the label gets generated?! ) X-posted to Eclipse Community Forum
@CODE:tree.addListener(SWT.Collapse, new Listener(){
   @Override
   public void handleEvent(Event e) {
    expandAndResize(false, (TreeItem) e.item);
   }
  });

  tree.addListener(SWT.Expand, new Listener() {
   @Override
   public void handleEvent(Event event) {
    expandAndResize(false, (TreeItem) event.item);
   }
  });

  System.out.println( (expand_?"Expanding":"Collapsing") + "item={" + item_ + "}");

@LINK:/questions/3184318/android-gps-callback-off-ui-thread
@TITLE:Android GPS Callback off UI Thread
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble getting the GPS's onLocationChanged to run on a different thread. I understand how to manage UI thread when I'm calling a function but with the GPS, I don't actively call the function. My intent is to have a light flash every time the GPS receives a reading. I have put this function in a Runnable. I passed this function to a class that implements LocationListener. Then in the main class, I started a new thread that calls requestLocationUpdates. I was hoping that onLocationChanged of the LocationListener would run in a different thread, post to the callback and make the necessary UI effects in the UI thread. Unfortunately, the program crashes every time it tries to call requestLocationUpdates. What's the proper way of doing it? Right now it looks something like this Main class: final Runnable changeLight = new Runnable(){
        public void run(){
            // do stuff
        }
    };

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.capture);

        status = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.status);
        database = new DatabaseManager(this);

        new Thread(){
            public void run(){
                location = (LocationManager) getSystemService(LOCATION_SERVICE);
                listener = new GPSManager(database, changeLight, light, status);
                location.requestLocationUpdates("gps", 10000L, 0, listener);
            }
        }.start();
    }
 LocationListener class: public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {
        if (location.getAccuracy() <= 32.0){
            light = lightColors.Green;
            status.post(callback);
            database.insertData(location);
        }
        else{
            light = lightColors.Yellow;
            status.post(callback);
        }
    }

@TITLE:Multi-parameter mapping with Three20 and TTURLMap
@CONTENT:I'm following this tutorial and declare the following mappings in my app delegate: [map from:@"x://profile/(initWithId:)/(name:)" toViewController:[ProfileViewController class]];
[map from:@"*" toViewController:[TTWebController class]];
 In ProfileViewController.m I implement the - (id)initWithId:(int)anIdentifier name:(NSString *)name selector to handle such mapping. I suppose opening URLs like x://profile/1/John Doe would invoke [[ProfileViewController alloc] initWithId:1 name:@"John Doe"], however, this seems not to be the case. The default TTWebController class gets called every time I open said URL. Using single parameter, i.e something like x://profile/(initWithId:) does the right thing, which is to call [[ProfileViewController alloc] initWithId:1]. Did I miss something here? How to use multi-parameter mapping with Three20 and TTURLMap?
@CODE:[map from:@"x://profile/(initWithId:)/(name:)" toViewController:[ProfileViewController class]];
[map from:@"*" toViewController:[TTWebController class]]; ProfileViewController.m - (id)initWithId:(int)anIdentifier name:(NSString *)name x://profile/1/John Doe [[ProfileViewController alloc] initWithId:1 name:@"John Doe"] TTWebController x://profile/(initWithId:) [[ProfileViewController alloc] initWithId:1]

@TITLE:Simple form not validating
@CONTENT:I have found here on stackoverflow a method to extend django's built-in authentication using signals. My base User is defined by 'email' and passwords (so no username there). So I'm trying to modify it to my needs, but I'm geting a validation error for my form. Strange thing is that error is connected to the User.email field and I'm getting 'already in use' even though I'm just registering at the moment. Is it trying to save it 2 times or what ? I've discovered it when I was sending dictionary with data to form's contstructor in shell: form = MyForm(data={}).

I have set the event listener for the "ended" event and I can detect that the video has finished, but I can't figure out how to close the video player and return to the thumbnails. It just waits for the user to touch the "done" button. Is there any way of doing this in Javascript??

@TITLE:How to map NHibernate custom collection with fluentNHibernate?
@CONTENT:I am trying to map the collection for two days without success. I also read all possible articles and forums but still down there. Ok, here is the problem: 1) The collection class contains a private field "_internalCollection" which is mapped with NHib. 2) The holding entity should expose the collection trough readonly property. 3) I want to avoid implementing NHibernate interface IUserCollectionType!!! I did this with xml mapping and it work great. The WarehouseEntity is a collection Item. Warehouses is a readonly property in OrgEntity class.   <component name="Warehouses" class="Core.Domain.Collections.EntitySet`1[Core.Domain.OrgStructure.IWarehouseEntity,Core],Core">
    <set name="_internalCollection" table="`WAREHOUSE`" cascade="save-update" access="field" generic="true" lazy="true" >
      <key column="`WarehouseOrgId`" foreign-key="FK_OrgWarehouse" />
      <!--This is used to set the type of the collection items-->
      <one-to-many class="Domain.Model.OrgStructure.WarehouseEntity,Domain"/>
    </set>
  </component>
 Any idea how can I do it with fluent NHibernate? EDIT: Core.Domain.Collections.EntitySet`1 is base collection class. It provides basic functionality for working with collections and can fit any class which is IEntity interface.
@CODE:<component name="Warehouses" class="Core.Domain.Collections.EntitySet`1[Core.Domain.OrgStructure.IWarehouseEntity,Core],Core">

@CONTENT:I'm writing a Wordpress plugin which injects a grid of images just above the footer on all frontend pages. The application is to display sponsor's logos. I'd like to harness the WP Media Library since the logos are already uploaded for use on the 'sponsorship' page and in posts. Essentially I'm stuck at accessing the media library interface on the plugin's options page. All of the legwork is done in terms of creating the options page, using the action hook to place content on frontend pages from the plugin, etc. What I need now is to be able to display all the files in the media library in a list on the options page, and provide a checkbox or something to allow the user to select certain files for insertion above the footer. The Media Library API seems to be aimed at people writing themes or media plugins. Help understanding what to make use of would be great!

@TITLE:Open Source, web based spreadsheet app with formulas
@CONTENT:I am looking for an open source spreadsheet application to stick into my web page. The most important feature I am searching for is formulas. Specifically, I need to be able to put in a cell which calculates the total of the contents of other specified cells. I've found some basic examples like Nitobi and ExtJs Extender, but they don't allow any calculations. Is this a lost cause, or is the perfect spreadsheet app out there, waiting for me to find it?

@TITLE:XNA - Drawing Quads (and primitives) in right order
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to 3D-stuff in XNA and unfortunately I have encountered a problem I can't find the solution for. (Don't even know what the problem is). To cut it short: I am drawing quads in my game using:         effect.World = Matrix.Identity *
            Matrix.CreateRotationX(Rotation.X) *
            Matrix.CreateRotationY(Rotation.Y) *
            Matrix.CreateRotationZ(Rotation.Z) *
            Matrix.CreateTranslation(Position);

        // Apply camera-matrixes
        effect.View = viewMatrix;
        effect.Projection = projectionMatrix;

        graphics.VertexDeclaration = vertDec;

        // Begin effect drawing
        effect.Begin();
        foreach (EffectPass pass in
            effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)
        {
            pass.Begin();
            graphics.DrawUserIndexedPrimitives
                <VertexPositionNormalTexture>(
                PrimitiveType.TriangleList,
                quad.Vertices, 0, 4,
                quad.Indexes, 0, 2);
            pass.End();
        }

        effect.End();
 My effect also has these properties:         this.effect.TextureEnabled = true;
        this.effect.Texture = texture;
 And it works. My quad is drawn nicely and me is happy. However there is one slight problem. If one quad is behind another quad or regular model the way that determines which is drawn on top is the order that I draw them in. Lets say I draw Quad A before Quad B, then B will be shown as on top of Quad A even if it is 40 units lesser in the Z-axis. Looks very confusing I must say! ;) Now I haven't had any problem like this with my regular meshes, it is when primitives are involved things get this messy. The very same problem goes for drawing regular lines:             graphics.DrawUserIndexedPrimitives<VertexPositionColor>(
                PrimitiveType.LineStrip,
                pointList,
                0,  // vertex buffer offset to add to each element of the index buffer
                6,  // number of vertices in pointList
                new short[] { 0, 1 },  // the index buffer
                0,  // first index element to read
                1   // number of primitives to draw
 So what I'm asking really is: A) Is this normal? Should I build a special engine which decides when to draw what? I can easily work around this in my project by drawing stuff at the right time but I can imagine a game where I could not. A fps for example couldn't draw its billboards all over the place! ;) B) If this is not normal, what could be the cause and what would be a solution/good way to debug the error. I would appreciate any help to sort this out! :)

@TITLE:MessageBox with timeout OR Closing a MessageBox from another thread
@CONTENT:If my application crashes, I use an ExceptionFilter to catch the crash, perform some final actions, then show a message box to the user that the application has crashed. Because the application already crashed, there's not much I can (or I dare) to do, because if I do too much, the executed code might access corrupted memory and crash again. Some of the things I currently can't do (or I don't dare to do) is to close network connections, Oracle database sessions, ... Problem is that if an application crashes, and the user is out to lunch while the MessageBox is open, other users might be blocked, because of the open database session. Therefore I want: Either a MessageBox with a time-out. Problem is that you can't do this with the standard MessageBox Win32 API function, and I don't want to make a specific dialog for it (because I want to minimize the executed logic after the crash) Or the possibility to close the MessageBox from another thread (the other thread can provide the time-out logic). Did I overlook something in the Win32 API and is there a possibility to have a MessageBox with a time-out? Or what is the correct way to close an open MessageBox from another thread (how to get the MessageBox handle, how to close it, ...)?

@LINK:/questions/3076466/using-different-spring-properties-for-integration-tests
@TITLE:Using different Spring properties for integration tests
@CONTENT:I am testing with Selenium a web application developed with Spring to check that the web application displays the right stuff for the user and that he's able to do everything that is in the specification. The other developers are using a fake Hibernate database in memory (HSQLDB) for unit testing. I have to use the real DB used by the program for testing, obviously. The JDBC parameters for the Spring application context are loaded by Spring at runtime (or compile time for building the WAR file). Spring use properties found by org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to configure the application context for the webapp and the tests, and the XML configuration files are shared by the tests and the webapp. The properties need to be different depending on the Maven profile, unit tests or integration tests. I tried several approaches, without success: developing my own DAO's using lower-level SQL queries. It's a real waste of time and solution of last resort. Because of the foreign key constraints and database model changes, and given that the application has a pretty solid (unit-tested) set of DAO's, it's really the dumbest option. using Maven filters and define the JDBC properties there. The problem is that the properties are shared between the main application and the unit tests, because the tomcat:redeploy goal include unit tests. The application then cannot connect to the real DB. having different properties in different folders. Spring doesn't care at all about the additional resources defined in the profiles' Surefire configuration, either with testResources or resources. The strange thing is that this approach works perfectly well for having different JDBC parameters for each environment in the main app. We have several folders in src/main/resources which contains properties overriding the default properties in src/main/resources. It just doesn't work the same way for src/test/resources. I don't even know how I could find the cause of this behavior. have Spring loading different property files based on user-defined Maven parameters. The same properties are used for the main app and the unit tests. Spring also complain when it cannot find the properties files (forcing me to create directories with empty files just to get the build completing). Why is the current build configuration, with the developer profile (developer, test server...) + the test profile (unit tests) activated at the same time running and the properties not overriding one another? Because Maven will make Spring look at src/test/resources when the unit tests are launched and src/main/resources when the build goal is launched. Unfortunately, there is no default configuration for integration tests like this.

@TITLE:Can Boost Program_options separate comma separated argument values
@CONTENT:If my command line is: > prog --mylist=a,b,c
 Can Boost's program_options be setup to see three distinct argument values for the mylist argument? I have configured program_options as: namespace po = boost::program_options;
po::options_description opts("blah")

opts.add_options()
    ("mylist", std::vector<std::string>>()->multitoken, "description");

po::variables_map vm;
po::store(po::parse_command_line(argc, argv, opts), vm);
po::notify(vm);
 When I check the value of the mylist argument, I see one value as a,b,c. I'd like to see three distinct values, split on comma. This works fine if I specify the command line as: > prog --mylist=a b c
 or > prog --mylist=a --mylist=b --mylist=c
 Is there a way to configure program_options so that it sees a,b,c as three values that should each be inserted into the vector, rather than one? I am using boost 1.41, g++ 4.5.0 20100520, and have enabled c++0x experimental extensions. EDIT: The accepted solution works but ends up being more complicated, IMO, than just iterating through a vector and splitting the values manually. In the end, I took the suggestion from James McNellis and implemented it that way. His solution wasn't submitted as an answer, however, so I accepted the other correct solution from hkaiser. Both worked, but the manual tokenization is clearer.
@CODE:> prog --mylist=a,b,c mylist namespace po = boost::program_options;
po::options_description opts("blah")

opts.add_options()
    ("mylist", std::vector<std::string>>()->multitoken, "description");

@TITLE:Differences between iPhone/iPod Simulator and Devices
@CONTENT:Since I started iPhone/iPod Development I have come across some differences between how the simulator and how real device react. Maybe I will come across some other differences I will have to figure out as well, maybe other people haven't met these problems here (YET) and can profit from the knowledge, and maybe you know some problems/differences that you would have been happy to know about earlier before you spent several hours or days figuring out what the heck is going on. So here is what I came across. Simulator is not case sensitive, Devices are case sensitive. This means a default.png or Icon.png will work in simulator, but not on a device where they must be named Default.png and icon.png (if it's still not working read this answer) Simulator has different codecs to play audio and video If you use f.e. MPMoviePlayerController you might play certain video on the simulator while on the device it won't work (use Handbrake->presets->iPhone & iPod Touch to create playable videos for Simulator and Device). If you play audio with AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(&soundID) you might here the sound on simulator but not an a device. (use Audacity to open your soundfile, export as wav and run afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@44100 -c 1 audacity.wav output.caf in terminal) Also there is this flickering on second run problem which can be resolved with an playerViewCtrl.initialPlaybackTime = -1.0; either on the end of playing or before each beginning. Simulator is mostly much faster cause it doesn't simulate the hardware but uses Mac resources, therefore f.e. sio2 Apps (OpenGL,OpenAL,etc. framework) run much better on simulator, well everything that uses more resources will run visibly better in simulator than on device. I hope we can add some more to this.

 The Select Case works find and it sets the right SelectListItem as Selected, but when my view renders the dropdown list no matter what is marked as selected the generated HTML does not have anything selected. I am obviously doing something wrong or missing something, but I can't for the life of me figure out what.
@CODE:<%=Html.DropDownListFor(Function(model) model.Arrdep, Model.ArrdepOptions)%> Public ReadOnly Property ArrdepOptions() As List(Of SelectListItem)

        arriveListItem.Value = ArriveDepart.Arrive
        departListItem.Text = "Depart At"
        departListItem.Value = ArriveDepart.Depart
        Select Case Me.Arrdep
            Case ArriveDepart.Arrive : arriveListItem.Selected = True
            Case Else : departListItem.Selected = True
        End Select

        list.Add(arriveListItem)

@CONTENT:So if I have a matrix (list of lists) where each column represents a unique word, each row represents a distinct document, and every entry is a 1 or 0, indicating whether or not the word for a given column exists in the document for a given row. What I'd like to know is how to determine all the possible combinations of words and documents where more than one word is in common with more than one document. The result might look something like: [ [[Docid_3, Docid_5], ['word1', 'word17', 'word23']], 
  [[Docid_3, Docid_9, Docid_334], ['word2', 'word7', 'word23', 'word68', 'word982']],
  ...
 and so on for each possible combination. Would love a solution that provides the complete set of combinations and one that yields only the combinations that are not a subset of another, so from the example, not [[Docid_3, Docid_5], ['word1', 'word17']] since it's a complete subset of the first example. I feel like there is an elegant solution that just isn't coming to mind and the beer isn't helping. Thanks.

The Tasks tab has a new task area with an associated project pulldown and the Projects tab (obviously) has a list of projects. What I'd like is for the pulldown on the Tasks tab to share the same collection as the Projects tab list so that any time I add or remove a project on the Projects tab the list on the Tasks tab is up to date automatically. This worked well with a single ViewModel but it was beginning to become quite unruly. Should I not have split into two ViewModels? Is there a common method of sharing data like this? Perhaps pass the same ObservableCollection<Project> into each of the ViewModels? Perhaps some type of notification back to the TasksViewModel along the lines of ICollectionChanged.

@LINK:/questions/3017804/unit-testing-with-fromasyncpattern
@TITLE:Unit testing with FromAsyncPattern
@CONTENT:The Reactive Extensions have a sexy little hook to simplify calling async methods: var func = Observable.FromAsyncPattern<InType, OutType>(
    myWcfService.BeginDoStuff,
    myWcfService.EndDoStuff);

func(inData).ObserveOnDispatcher().Subscribe(x => Foo(x));
 I am using this in an WPF project, and it works great at runtime. Unfortunately, when trying to unit test methods that use this technique I am experiencing random failures. ~3 out of every five executions of a test that contain this code fails. Here is a sample test (implemented using a Rhino/unity auto-mocking container): [TestMethod()]
public void SomeTest()
{
   // arrange
   var container = GetAutoMockingContainer();

   container.Resolve<IMyWcfServiceClient>()
      .Expect(x => x.BeginDoStuff(null, null, null))
      .IgnoreArguments()
      .Do(
         new Func<Specification, AsyncCallback, object, IAsyncResult>((inData, asyncCallback, state) =>
            {
               return new CompletedAsyncResult(asyncCallback, state);
             }));

   container.Resolve<IRepositoryServiceClient>()
      .Expect(x => x.EndDoStuff(null))
      .IgnoreArguments()
      .Do(
         new Func<IAsyncResult, OutData>((ar) =>
         {
            return someMockData;
         }));

   // act
   var target = CreateTestSubject(container);

   target.DoMethodThatInvokesService();

   // Run the dispatcher for everything over background priority
   Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Background, new Action(() => { }));

   // assert
   Assert.IsTrue(my operation ran as expected);
}
 The problem that I see is that the code that I specified to run when the async action completed (in this case, Foo(x)), is never called. I can verify this by setting breakpoints in Foo and observing that they are never reached. Further, I can force a long delay after calling DoMethodThatInvokesService (which kicks off the async call), and the code is still never run. I do know that the lines of code invoking the Rx framework were called. Other things I've tried: I have attempted to modify the second last line according to the suggestions here: Reactive Extensions Rx - unit testing something with ObserveOnDispatcher No love. I have added .Take(1) to the Rx code as follows: func(inData).ObserveOnDispatcher().Take(1).Subscribe(x => Foo(x)); This improved my failure rate to something like 1 in 5, but they still occurred. I have rewritten the Rx code to use the plain jane Async pattern. This works, however my developer ego really would love to use Rx instead of boring old begin/end. In the end I do have a work around in hand (i.e. don't use Rx), however I feel that it is not ideal. If anyone has ran into this problem in the past and found a solution, I'd dearly love to hear it. Update: I also posted on the Rx forums, and they will be including a test scheduler with a coming release. That will probably be the ultimate solution once it is available.

Edit: The error I get when firing up the integration test is:  Caused by: org.springframework.......DataSourceLookupFailureException:

@TITLE:Best practices: displaying text that was input via multi-line text box
@CONTENT:I have a multi-line text box. When users simply type away, the text box wraps the text, and it's saved as a single line. It's also possible that users may enter line breaks, for example when entering a "bulleted" lists like: Here are some suggestions:
 - fix this
 - remove that
 - and another thing
 Now, the problem occurs when I try to display the value of this field. In order to preserve the formatting, I currently wrap the presentation in <pre> - this works to preserve user-supplied breaks, but when there's a lot of text saved as a single line, it displays the whole text block as single line, resulting in horizontal scrolling being needed to see everything. Is there a graceful way to handle both of these cases?

@CONTENT:What is the correct/best way to create a menu with hotkey shortcuts? I simply want a File menu like Visual Studio's that has New, Open, Save, Save All, Exit, and a few other standard shortcuts. It seems that InputGestureText displays the appropriate text, but since it's called "Text" and doesn't seem to trigger events, I'm going to assume that isn't the right way to do it. The Command architecture also seems fairly bulky, so I don't want to head down that path if there is a better way. Update: For clarity, let's say I'm using the following menu: <Menu>
  <MenuItem Header="_File">
    <MenuItem Header="_New" />
    <MenuItem Header="_Open" />
    <Separator />
    <MenuItem Header="_Save" />
    <MenuItem Header="Save _All" />
    <Separator />
    <MenuItem Header="_Export"/>
    <MenuItem Header="_Import"/>
    <Separator />
    <MenuItem Header="E_xit"/>
  </MenuItem>
</Menu>
 where Export and Import would be custom shortcuts; something that Microsoft didn't build into something like ApplicationCommands. Can you please provide a complete solution, including C# custom code if necessary? (Not only will it help me out, but I hope to help anyone else out who is searching for similar issues.)

@LINK:/questions/2982897/php-mysql-time-zone-migration
@TITLE:PHP/MySQL time zone migration
@CONTENT:I have an application that currently stores timestamps in MySQL DATETIME and TIMESTAMP values. However, the application needs to be able to accept data from users in multiple time zones and show the timestamps in the time zone of other users. As such, this is how I plan to amend the application; I would appreciate any suggestions to improve the approach. Database modifications All TIMESTAMPs will be converted to DATETIME values; this is to ensure consistency in approach and to avoid having MySQL try to do clever things and convert time zones (I want to keep the conversion in PHP, as it involves less modification to the application, and will be more portable when I eventually manage to escape from MySQL). All DATETIME values will be adjusted to convert them to UTC time (currently all in Australian EST) Query modifications All usage of NOW() to be replaced with UTC_TIMESTAMP() in queries, triggers, functions, etc. Application modifications The application must store the time zone and preferred date format (e.g. US vs the rest of the world) All timestamps will be converted according to the user settings before being displayed All input timestamps will be converted to UTC according to the user settings before being input Additional notes Converting formats will be done at the application level for several main reasons The approach to converting time zones varies from DB to DB, so handing it there will be non-portable (and I really hope to be migrating away from MySQL some time in the not-to-distant future). MySQL TIMESTAMPs have limited ranges to the permitted dates (~1970 to ~2038) MySQL TIMESTAMPs have other undesirable attributes, including bizarre auto-update behaviour (if not carefully disabled) and sensitivity to the server zone settings (and I suspect I might screw these up when I migrate to Amazon later in the year). The choice to change all the current datetime values, and to use UTC_TIMESTAMP() instead of NOW() is to avoid any problems with server / connection time zone setups, which would modify NOW() but leave UTC_TIMESTAMP() alone; see below for an example. Example of UTC_TIMESTAMP() vs NOW() mysql> set time_zone = 'Australia/Canberra';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

@TITLE:Escape whitespace in paths using nautilus script
@CONTENT:I didn't think this would be as tricky as it turned out to be, but here I am. I'm trying to write a Nautilus script in Python to upload one or more images to Imgur just by selecting and right clicking them. It works well enough with both single images and multiple images - as long as they don't contain any whitespace. In fact, you can upload a single image containing whitespace, just not multiple ones. The problem is that NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS returns all the selected files and directories as a space separated string. So for example, it could look like this: print os.environment['NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS']
/home/nevon/Desktop/test image.png /home/nevon/Desktop/test.jpg
 What I need is a way to -either in bash or Python- escape the spaces in the path - but not the spaces that delimit different items. Either that, or a way to put quotation marks around each item. The ultimate solution would be if I could do that in bash and then send the items as separate arguments to my python script. Something like: python uploader.py /home/nevon/Desktop/test\ image.png /home/nevon/Desktop/test.jpg
 I've tried RTFM'ing, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of good solutions for this. At least not that I've found. Any ideas?

@TITLE:How can i design a DB where the user can define the fields and types of a detail table in a M-D relationship?
@CONTENT:My application has one table called 'events' and each event has approx 30 standard fields, but also user defined fields that could be any name or type, in an 'eventdata' table. Users can define these event data tables, by specifying x number of fields (either text/double/datetime/boolean) and the names of these fields. This 'eventdata' (table) can be different for each 'event'. My current approach is to create a lookup table for the definitions. So if i need to query all 'event' and 'eventdata' per record, i do so in a M-D relaitionship using two queries (i.e. select * from events, then for each record in 'events', select * from 'some table'). Is there a better approach to doing this? I have implemented this so far, but most of my queries require two distinct calls to the DB - i cannot simply join my master 'events' table with different 'eventdata' tables for each record in in 'events'. I guess my main question is: can i join my master table with different detail tables for each record? E.g. SELECT E.*, E.Tablename 
FROM events E 
LEFT JOIN 'E.tablename' T ON E._ID = T.ID
 If not, is there a better way to design my database considering i have no idea on how many user defined fields there may be and what type they will be.

I need to store extra information in this relationship, for example the day when the item was bought. I wonder how is this usually modelled in JPA, cause I'm not sure how to express this in code. Do I have to create a new class to model all the attributes of the relationship and make a manyToMany relationship between the other classes or is a better way to do this? Thanks

    //how do I make the if-statment to check if the token has been already set once?

    }

}
 So I have the token as a hidden value, but how do I use that to prevent multiple clicking of submit. METHODS: someone suggested using sessions. I would set the random token to $_SESSION['_token'] and check if that session token is equal to the $_POST['_token'], but how do I do that? When I tried, it still doesn't check
@CODE://makerandomtoken(20) returns a random 20 length char. 

<form  method="post" ... >

<input type="hidden" name="_token" value="<?php echo $token=makerandomtoken(20); ?>" />

@TITLE:Visual studio deployment project error when writing to registry
@CONTENT:I have a setup for an application that was recently converted to be a framework 4.0 project (don't know if it's relevant). The setup has to write to registry (Local Machine) and until now this has always worked perfectly, however now it fails to write to registry on a clean machine (running Windows 7, 64 bit). The setup does not fail, does not show a warning of any kind, however it does not write to the registry (I even set AlwaysCreate property to true on every key, just in case) which of course causes the application to terminate on startup. What could be the cause of this? I have never encountered such an error before. Edit: I have tried running the installer as administrator, didn't change anything.

@CONTENT:I was wondering how to develop a secure form post through AJAX. For example, i have: My HTML form. My JavaScript handling the submit. The submit url is "post_data.php" The posted data is: id=8&name=Denis The PHP verifies if variables id and name are POSTED and their data type. If this is ok it proceed to do some stuff on a database. My question is, how can i prevent someone from creating his own html form, outside my web site, or whatever, and posting false data to my PHP script? Imagine that data realy exists on my database, this could be bad. Thanks

@TITLE:Switching languages on a website with PHP
@CONTENT:I'm just looking for some advice. I'm creating a website that offers (at least) 2 languages. The way I'm setting it up is by using XML files for the language, PHP to retrieve the values in the XML nodes. Say you have any XML file, being loaded as follows: <?php
$lang = "en";
$xmlFile = simplexml_load_file("$lang/main.xml");
?>
 Once the file contents are available, I just output each node into an HTML tag like so: <li><?php echo $xmlFile->navigation->home; ?></li>
which in turn is equal to : <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
as a nav bar link.
 Now, the way in which I'm switching languages is by changing the value of the "$lang" variable, through a "$_POST", like so: if(isset($_POST['es'])){
$lang = "es";
}elseif(isset($_POST['en'])){
$lang = "en";
}
 The value of the "$lang" variable is reset and the new file is loaded, loading as well all the new nodes from the new XML file, hence changing the language. I'm just wondering if there is another way to reset the "$lang" variable using something else, other than "$_POST" or "$_GET". I don't want to use query string either. I know I could use JavaScript or jQuery to achieve this, but I'd like to make the site not too dependable on JavaScript. I'd appreciate any ideas or advice. Thanks

$lang = "en";
$xmlFile = simplexml_load_file("$lang/main.xml");

@TITLE:Fastest 2D frame rate possible with android NDK, my try included, better options available?
@CONTENT:Fastest 2D frame rate possible with android NDK, my try included, better options available? I used the NDK and OpenGL ES 2.0 to display a frame as a texture on a GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP. This was done on a HTC Desire, same hardware as Nexus One. I tried to load multiple GL_RGBA textures and switch between the textures, because the normal fill rate with a single texture was disappointingly low: 1 texture: 4.78 fps 2 textures: 19.68 fps 3 textures: 20.18 fps 4 textures: 28.52 fps 5 textures: 29.01 fps 6 textures: 30.32 fps I think even 30.32 fps RGBA is still too slow. So is this the way to go to achieve the fastest 2D frame rate (with same quality)? Any suggestions to speed it up? Here is the relevant code, it is based on the hello-gl2 NDK example: === GL2JNIView.java : init(false, 0, 0);

@TITLE:How long is the time frame between context switches on Windows?
@CONTENT:Reading CLR via C# 2.0 (I dont have 3.0 with me at the moment) Is this still the case: If there is only one CPU in a computer, only one thread can run at any one time. Windows has to keep track of the thread objects, and every so often, Windows has to decide which thread to schedule next to go to the CPU. This is additional code that has to execute once every 20 milliseconds or so. When Windows makes a CPU stop executing one thread's code and start executing another thread's code, we call this a context switch. A context switch is fairly expensive because the operating system has to: So circa CLR via C# 2.0 lets say we are on Pentium 4 2.4ghz 1 core non-HT, XP. Every 20 milliseconds? Where a CLR thread or Java thread is mapped to an OS thread only a maximum of 50 threads per second may get a chance to to run? I've read that context switching is very fast in mircoseconds here on SO, but how often roughly (magnitude style guesses) will say a modest 5 year old server Windows 2003 Pentium Xeon single core give the OS the opportunity to context switch? 20ms in the right area? I dont need exact figures I just want to be sure that's in the right area, seems rather long to me.

@TITLE:Algorithm for converting hierarchical flat data (w/ ParentID) into sorted flat list w/ indentation levels
@CONTENT:I have the following structure: MyClass {
  guid ID
  guid ParentID
  string Name
}
 I'd like to create an array which contains the elements in the order they should be displayed in a hierarchy (e.g. according to their "left" values), as well as a hash which maps the guid to the indentation level. For example: ID     Name     ParentID
------------------------
1      Cats     2
2      Animal   NULL
3      Tiger    1
4      Book     NULL
5      Airplane NULL
 This would essentially produce the following objects: // Array is an array of all the elements sorted by the way you would see them in a fully expanded tree
Array[0] = "Airplane"
Array[1] = "Animal"
Array[2] = "Cats"
Array[3] = "Tiger"
Array[4] = "Book"

// IndentationLevel is a hash of GUIDs to IndentationLevels.
IndentationLevel["1"] = 1
IndentationLevel["2"] = 0
IndentationLevel["3"] = 2
IndentationLevel["4"] = 0
IndentationLevel["5"] = 0
 For clarity, this is what the hierarchy looks like: Airplane
Animal
  Cats
    Tiger
Book
 I'd like to iterate through the items the least amount of times possible. I also don't want to create a hierarchical data structure. I'd prefer to use arrays, hashes, stacks, or queues. The two objectives are: Store a hash of the ID to the indentation level. Sort the list that holds all the objects according to their left values. When I get the list of elements, they are in no particular order. Siblings should be ordered by their Name property. Update: This may seem like I haven't tried coming up with a solution myself and simply want others to do the work for me. However, I have tried coming up with three different solutions, and I've gotten stuck on each. One reason might be that I've tried to avoid recursion (maybe wrongly so). I'm not posting the partial solutions I have so far since they are incorrect and may badly influence the solutions of others.

 In the ViewModel, I have a corresponding list of ItemViewModels. I would like this list to be two-way bound to the model's list: public ObservableCollection<ItemViewModel> ItemViewModels ...
 In the XAML, I will bind (in this case a TreeView) to the ItemViewModels property. My question is, what goes in the "..." in the ViewModel shown above? I am hoping for a line or two of code to binds these two ObservableCollections (providing the type of the ViewModel to construct for each model object). However, what I'm fearing is necessary is a bunch of code to handle the Items.CollectionChanged event and manually updates the ItemViewModels list by constructing ViewModels as necessary, and the corresponding opposite that will update the Items collection based on changes to ItemViewModels. Thanks! Eric

@TITLE:Best practice to avoid ¡§add friend¡¨ abuse
@CONTENT:I have a PHP / CodeIgniter site with basic social functionality which obviously includes an "Add friend" link. When clicking this link an AJAX call is made in the background, which adds the user associated with the link as a friend of the logged in user. Also the link transforms into "Remove friend" which does what it says on the tin, just the way "Add friend" does. When "Add friend" is clicked the user who's added as a friend is notified via e-mail that he or she has been added as a friend. This is where my question comes in: I want to avoid spamming the user with these notification e-mails if the logged in user keeps clicking add / remove / add / remove / etc. My idea is to set up sort of an add history table which records the 2 user ids and a timestamp. And I'd only send out an e-mail if the (current time - timestamp) is bigger than a set value. And every time a user would re-add a friend I'd update the timestamp to the current time so it "extends" the valability of the spam control. With this method I could also control if a user wants to add too many friends in a given interval. This table would be cleared from time to time for records with the timestamp farther away in the past than a given value. This is my idea, if you have other ones or used different methods please share. Thanks for reading.

@CONTENT:I need to add a web-based capability to allow users to scan images using a local TWAIN or WIA compliant scanner or digital camera and then upload those images to the server. (The scanning experience should be integrated into the web UI as opposed to just allowing them to scan it locally using whatever tools and then upload the resulting file(s) in the web UI). I've found Microsoft's Silverlight WIA implementation and Asprise's JTwain applet each of which do roughly what I'm looking for, but only handle either WIA or TWAIN and do so using different technologies. Is anyone aware of a library/product/etc. that would provide similar functionality with access to both TWAIN and WIA? Ideally, something cross browser independent, but should it come to it, it could potentially be restricted to IE. On the outside, I'd even be open to separate solutions using the same technology (e.g. a WIA java applet, or a TWAIN silverlight app, or two apps in whatever language that separately do both). Thanks

@TITLE:WPF HwndHost keyboard focus
@CONTENT:The chart area in the screenshot is a HwndHost control which hosts a native Win32 window (with it's own registered WNDCLASS) implemented in C++/CLI and drawn with Direct2D. The HwndHost is hosted in a WPF Border control. The problem I have is that I can't set the keyboard focus to the hosted Win32 window. I want the focus to move to the hosted Win32 window when the used clicks on the chart area. I tried calling SetFocus on WM_LBUTTONDOWN, but that screws up the focus in the rest of the application. Currently, even if I click on the Win32 window, the focus remains on the tree-view on the left, and if I press the up/down cursor keys, the tree-view will get them, not the chart window. How do I make the hosted Win32 window receive keyboard input from when the user clicks on the chart area, until it clicks on another control (like the tree-view, or the toolbar)? EDIT: Here's the C++/CLI code for the window host: template <typename T>
inline T intPtrToPtr(IntPtr value)
{
    return reinterpret_cast<T>(static_cast<void*>(value));
}

public ref class ChartWindowHost : public HwndHost, IKeyboardInputSink
{

 Pardon my ignorance, but is there an easy way to this with PHP and then turn it back to a string, when needed, for readability?

@TITLE:Problem using PHP to open text file - blank spaces are removed
@CONTENT:I'm trying to open and process ASCII files using PHP, but am having problems. The problem is that the blank spaces are removed, which I don't want to have happen, since the files are fixed width. The PHP script I used is this: $myFile = Test.SEG";
$file_handler = fopen ($myFile, r) or die ("Can't open SEG File.");
while (!feof($file_handler))
    {
    $dataline = fgets($file_handler);
    echo $dataline, "<br />";
    }
 I tried pasting samples of the original file in here, but the spaces were removed here as well! At this stage I'm just building the script in steps, getting one step working at a time, but this is as far as I've gotten. I plan to use substr() on '$dataline' to pick out the fields I need. Any suggestions on how to keep the spaces intact? Something tells me it's something to do with encoding, but I don't know for sure. Thanks!

For example, we have a panel control that has a title, a place for buttons related to the contents of the panel, and of course the contents. How is this best accomplished in MVC? RenderPartial doesn't get done what I need here. Should I still be using the same controls, but just on a view page? These controls don't really do anything on postback, they are only there for a common look and feel. More Info: We have a control in Webforms that implements ICompositeControl. We have a few properties on this control like Panel (type Panel), Buttons (again type Panel which would hold buttons) and a property Title of type string. Visually it looks like

 And when I try to animate the key path "customProperties.roll" using CABasicAnimation and addAnimation:forKey:, it seems that the customProperties variable doesn't get copied from the model layer to the presentation layer, and the customProperties of the presentation layer appears to be nil, failing to update the value for the key "roll". Is there a way to animate values in a dictionary correctly? What is the exact relationship between a model layer and a presentation layer while being animated? Thanks!

If I add an alert or something before or after the window.open call, the alert works fine, but the window doesn't open. If I add a window.open completly after the $.post method, the window opens fine (of course this doens't help me at all). I'm wondering why I can't open a window in the callback.

I am developing an application with three windows, which I will show basic information about the device, these windows are already done and working.

    public vtnbateria vtnbateria;

@TITLE:Distributed Source Control - pushing individual changesets
@CONTENT:Working on a bit of a sticky problem and was hoping for some help from the community. Basically, our dev team is split up into two teams, lets say "Red" and "Blue" 3 repos: 1: Master 2: Red >> Clone of master 3: Blue >> Clone of master Each developer is cloning red or blue on their local machine where they are working. Both teams are working on various tasks for our main application. Each team has a clone of our Shared "Master" Repository on which they are applying their changesets. The changesets are verified at that level, at which point they are ready to be pushed into the Master. To simplify, lets say developer A and B are both on Red team. So the problem comes when developer A pushes changeset 1, then developer B pushes changeset 2. Then changeset 1 is verified and ready to go into Master but changeset 2 is not. I want to push changeset 1 to Master as soon as possible, and not wait for verification to changeset 2, especially since changeset 3 could be being introduced in the meantime. We're currently using mercurial and I like it - I would be willing to switch to git if the workflow for what I want to do would be easier. Am i thinking about this wrong? I appreciate the help.

@TITLE:Social Networking & Network Affiliations
@CONTENT:I am in the process of planning a database for a social networking project and stumbled upon this url which is a (crude) reverse engineered guess at facebook's schema: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ikhnaton2/533233247/ What is of interest to me is the notion of "Affiliations" and I am trying to fully understand how they work, technically speaking. Where I am somewhat confused is the NetworkID column in the FacebookGroups", "FacebookEvent", and "Affiliations" tables (NID in Affiliations). How are these network affiliations interconnected? In my own project, I have a simple profile table: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Profiles](
    [profileid] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [userid] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    [username] [varchar](255) COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AI NOT NULL,

    [username] ASC,
    [applicationname] ASC
)WITH (IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY]
 One profile can have many affiliations. And one affiliation can have many profiles. And I would like to design it in such a way that relationships between affiliations tells me something about the associated profiles. In fact, based on the affiliations that users select, I would like to know how to infer as many things as possible about that person. My question is, how should I be designing my network affiliation tables and how do they operate per my above requirements? A rough SQL schema would be appreciated in your response. Thanks in advance...

I'm using NSXMLParser and for each element found creating a new entity (if a matching one doesn't already exist). So I will create a state entity and then populate all the city entities and then do a save. This means that a state's NSSet *cities is getting added to but I don't see why you can't do that.

@TITLE:Boost ASIO async_write ¡§Vector iterator not dereferencable¡¨
@CONTENT:I've been working on an async boost server program, and so far I've got it to connect. However I'm now getting a "Vector iterator not dereferencable" error. I suspect the vector gets destroyed or dereferenced before he packet gets sent thus causing the error. void start()
{
    Packet packet;
    packet.setOpcode(SMSG_PING);
    send(packet);
}

void send(Packet packet)
{
    cout << "DEBUG> Transferring packet with opcode " << packet.GetOpcode() << endl;

{
    cout << "DEBUG> Transfered " << bytesTransferred << " bytes to " << m_socket.remote_endpoint().address().to_string() << endl;
}
 Start gets called once a connection is made. packet.write() returns a uint8_t vector Would it matter if I'd change void send(Packet packet)
 to void send(Packet& packet)
 Not in relation to this problem but performance wise.
@CODE:void start()

    Packet packet;
    packet.setOpcode(SMSG_PING);

@TITLE:Indentation control while developing a small python like language
@CONTENT:I'm developing a small python like language using flex, byacc (for lexical and parsing) and C++, but i have a few questions regarding scope control. just as python it uses white spaces (or tabs) for indentation, not only that but i want to implement index breaking like for instance if you type "break 2" inside a while loop that's inside another while loop it would not only break from the last one but from the first loop as well (hence the number 2 after break) and so on. example: while 1
    while 1
        break 2
        'hello world'!! #will never reach this. "!!" outputs with a newline
    end
    'hello world again'!! #also will never reach this. again "!!" used for cout
end
#after break 2 it would jump right here
 but since I don't have an "anti" tab character to check when a scope ends (like C for example i would just use the '}' char) i was wondering if this method would the the best: I would define a global variable, like "int tabIndex" on my yacc file that i would access in my lex file using extern. then every time i find a tab character on my lex file i would increment that variable by 1. when parsing on my yacc file if i find a "break" keyword i would decrement by the amount typed after it from the tabIndex variable, and when i reach and EOF after compiling and i get a tabIndex != 0 i would output compilation error. now the problem is, whats the best way to see if the indentation got reduced, should i read \b (backspace) chars from lex and then reduce the tabIndex variable (when the user doesn't use break)? another method to achieve this? also just another small question, i want every executable to have its starting point on the function called start() should i hardcode this onto my yacc file? sorry for the long question any help is greatly appreciated. also if someone can provide an yacc file for python would be nice as a guideline (tried looking on Google and had no luck). thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Migrating ASP.NET (MVC 2) on .NET 3.5 over to .NET 4 #gotchas
@CONTENT:I've currently got a ASP.NET MVC 2 application on .NET 3.5 and I want to migrate it over to the new .NET 4.0 with Visual Studio 2010. Reason being that it's always good to stay on top of these things - plus I really like the new automatic encoding with <%: %> and clean web.config :-) So, does anyone have any experience they could share? Looking for gotchas and the likes. I guess this could also apply to any ASP.NET Forms projects aswell. TIA, Charles

@TITLE:UItextfield text alignment issue in cocos2D iPhone
@CONTENT:Please take a look of the following screen shot. Here is my code, I am using cocos2D CGAffineTransform transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(3.14159/2);  
_view = [[CCDirector sharedDirector]openGLView];

 // Input the user name
_nameField = [[UITextField alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(130.0, 270.0, 200.0, 30.0)];

 The problem is the text is aligned to the top of the text field. I want it to be in the middle not to top. There is too much space in the bottom. please suggest me the way.

@TITLE:Cannot understand NullPointerException with custom adapter
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a list view which as TextView that can display html content , an WebView and other basic TextViews.I tried to extend SimpleAdapter but i struck with the problem ,I will be glad if someone can point out the mistake i am doing. In onCreate method  ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> mylist= resultfromXmlparser();

 adap = new MyAdapter(TourLandingPage.this, mylist, R.layout.row,
            new String[] {"Name", "desc","Duration","Price","imgurl"},  new int[]
            {R.id.productname,R.id.des,R.id.duration,R.id.pricefrom,R.id.photo});

setListAdapter(adap);


My custom Adapter looks like this

 private class MyAdapter extends SimpleAdapter {

@CONTENT:I have set up Eclipse PDT on Galileo. I'm able to run and debug PHP sites that are set up on XAMPP. The thing is, I want to profile one of the sites, but cannot for the life of me figure out how to set this up. There is a profiling menu when I right-click the PHP project, but no indication of how to proceed from there. BTW I'm using Xdebug as the debug engine.

@TITLE:Migrating ASP.NET (MVC 2) on .NET 3.5 over to .NET 4 #gotchas
@CONTENT:I've currently got a ASP.NET MVC 2 application on .NET 3.5 and I want to migrate it over to the new .NET 4.0 with Visual Studio 2010. Reason being that it's always good to stay on top of these things - plus I really like the new automatic encoding with <%: %> and clean web.config :-) So, does anyone have any experience they could share? Looking for gotchas and the likes. I guess this could also apply to any ASP.NET Forms projects aswell. TIA, Charles

@CONTENT:Please take a look of the following screen shot. Here is my code, I am using cocos2D CGAffineTransform transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(3.14159/2);

 The problem is the text is aligned to the top of the text field. I want it to be in the middle not to top. There is too much space in the bottom. please suggest me the way.

@CONTENT:I am trying to create a list view which as TextView that can display html content , an WebView and other basic TextViews.I tried to extend SimpleAdapter but i struck with the problem ,I will be glad if someone can point out the mistake i am doing. In onCreate method  ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> mylist= resultfromXmlparser();

 adap = new MyAdapter(TourLandingPage.this, mylist, R.layout.row,
            new String[] {"Name", "desc","Duration","Price","imgurl"},  new int[]
            {R.id.productname,R.id.des,R.id.duration,R.id.pricefrom,R.id.photo});

setListAdapter(adap);


My custom Adapter looks like this

 With the changes above, my service compiled and install fine.

I also tried my service on my Windows 2000 machine, it does not even start(it will be stuck on the "starting" status) My main objective is getting the service to run properly on the Windows 7 environment, getting it backward compatible in Windows 2000 will be a bonus.

@TITLE:Windows Installer custom action BEFORE any validation
@CONTENT:I wrote a Windows Installer custom action based on the tutorial found here: http://www.codeproject.com/kb/install/msicustomaction.aspx My custom action is killing a background process of a given name which could still be opened by the user. The reason is that I don't want users to see the warning that a given EXE is running and must be closed so that setup can continue. This works fine when the MSI passes through the UI sequence as the action is created in "InstallUISequence" table like in the tutorial. However, when the MSI is used silently (right-click and select repair or uninstall), then my custom action isn't executed of course. Where do I have to put my custom action so that it is executed immediately also when run silently? I tried adding it to "InstallExecuteSequence", but the 'app running' warning is still shown. I then tried lowering the sequence number of my custom action to 5, but this also didn't help. Note: I'm using Orca to modify an MSI generated from a Visual Studio setup project. I'm then using the transform file to apply it.

For example, I may want to develop a reporting framework where I need to use domain objects to access the DB. I Hope the question is clear.

@TITLE:Using new Image().src for click tracking
@CONTENT:I am attempting to figure out why this click tracker isn't working. The code was written by another developer so I am not entirely sure if this ever did work. function trackSponsor(o, p) {
        (new Image()).src = PATH_BASE + 'click/' + p + '/' + o + "?_cache=" + (+(new Date()));
    return false;
}
 From what I can gather is that when this function is called it 'creates a new image' to fire a php script asynchronously. According to Firebug, the request is made however it is 'aborted' ~30ms in. The odd thing is that it will 'sometimes' work as in 1 in every 10+ regardless of the browser. I would much rather fix this so that it works instead of re-writing it as an ajax request. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. EDIT Because of tvanfosson's post that got me thinking. I have included the line which calls the click tracker below. <a onclick="trackSponsor(60, 15077); goToNextStep(1988, 15077, 0); return false;" href="#">view</a>
 the goToNextStep() actually changes the page. I am under the impression that it would only be executed after trackSponsor() had finished.
@CODE:function trackSponsor(o, p) {
        (new Image()).src = PATH_BASE + 'click/' + p + '/' + o + "?_cache=" + (+(new Date()));

@TITLE:Back Button gets Disabled on IE 7,8 for an ASP.NET site
@CONTENT:In an ASP.NET 3.5 website we are noticing that the back button is not working properly. If the user does several postbacks (say 10 times), and than starts pressing back button - the back button gets disabled before the user gets through all the pages. The site does not use AJAX.net. I can reproduce the issue on IE 7 and 8 almost always. The problem seems to be with some sort of limit IE has on History Cache for a given tab/instance. In the tests I did the post request to the server are large - around 83k, and the responses are are round 300k. It seems that with these request sizes the history does not hold more than 4 items. The moment I get to the 5 post, the first item i had selected is dropped.

@TITLE:Why is .NET Post different from CURL? broken?
@CONTENT:NOTE: I fixed the user agent problem and i also added in an extra byte to match the content length. No luck however. I dont understand this. I ran this code below and the result json string was the link is expired (meaning invalid). However the curl code does the exact same thing and works. I either get the expected string with the url or it says i need to wait (for a few seconds to 1 minute). Why? whats the difference between the two? It looks very F%^&*ed up that it is behaving differently (its been causing me HOURS of problems). NOTE: the only cookie required by the site is SID (tested). It holds your session id. The first post activates it and the 2nd command checks the status with the returning json string. Feel free to set the CookieContainer to only use SID if you like. WARNING: you may want to change SID to a different value so other people arent activating it. Your may want to run the 2nd url to ensure the session id is not used and says expired/invalid before you start. additional note: with curl or in your browser if you do the POST command you can stick the sid in .NET cookie container and the 2nd command will work. But doing the first command (the POST data) will not work. This post function i have used for many other sites that require post and so far it has worked. Obviously checking the Method is a big deal and i see it is indeed POST when doing the first command.     static void Main(string[] args)

@TITLE:Accessing mapped drives when impersonating in ASP.NET
@CONTENT:Short version: Is it possible or not to use impersonation in ASP.NET to access mapped drives? Long Version: I'm currently using impersonation in ASP.NET to gain access to network files. This is working perfectly for any network file using a UNC path, but it is failing to access any files on mapped drives defined for the user account I'm impersonating. For example, let's say a file lives on the network at \\machine\folder\file.txt, and let's also say that drive S: is mapped to \\machine\folder. We need to be able to access both the full UNC path, \\machine\folder\file.txt, as well as the shorter, mapped drive path, S:\file.txt. Obviously the standard ASP.NET process cannot access either. Using a console application that runs under the local account with the mapped S: drive, calling File.Exists(@"\\machine\folder\file.txt") returns true, and File.Exists(@"S:\file.txt") also returns true. However, when impersonating in an ASP.NET context with the same local account, only File.Exists(@"\\machine\folder\file.txt") returns true. File.Exists(@"S:\file.txt") returns false. I'm testing with IIS?7 running on my local Windows?7 Professional box, though this will need to run in both IIS?6 and IIS?7. Impersonation is handled with a couple of classes in C# which I'll include here: public static class Impersonation
{

@TITLE:How is an SOA architecture really supposed to be implemented?
@CONTENT:My project is converting a legacy fat-client desktop application into the web. The database is not changing as a result. Consequently, we are being forced to call external web services to access data in our own database. Couple this with the fact that some parts of our application are allowed to access the database directly through DAOs (a practice that is much faster and easier). The functionality we're supposed to call web services for are what has been deemed necessary for downstream, dependent systems. Is this really how SOA is supposed to work? Admittedly, this is my first foray into the SOA world, but I have to think this is the complete wrong way to go about this.

@CONTENT:I need to run a Select statement (DB2 SQL) that does not pull adjacent row duplicates based on a certain field. In specific, I am trying to find out when data changes, which is made difficult because it might change back to its original value. That is to say, I have a table that vaguely resembles the below, sorted by Letter and then by Date: A, 5, 2009-01-01
A, 12, 2009-02-01

 discarding adjacent duplicates but keeping the last row (despite it having the same number as the first row). The obvious: Select Letter, Number, Min(Update_Date) from Table group by Letter, Number 
 does not work -- it doesn't include the last row. Edit: As there seems to have been some confusion, I have clarified the month column into a date column. It was meant as a human-parseable short form, not as actual valid data. Edit: The last row is not important BECAUSE it is the last row, but because it has a "new value" that is also an "old value". Grouping by NUMBER would wrap it in with the first row; it needs to remain a separate entity.

 Trying to put this into English, I want to group consecutive records with the same 'Source' together, then printing out a single record per group showing the highest time offset in that group, the source, and the sum of the lengths in that group. The TimeOffset values will always increase. I suspect this is possible in R, but I really don't know where to start. In a pinch I could export the data frame out and do it in e.g. Python, but I'd prefer to stay within R if possible. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide

 Did something change in recent android releases? It seems that most of these are now 'private resources'... couldn't find much info on this but I found some advice: It is used to access private resources. Do not use it because these private resources are often removed/renamed/etc. Using it would most likely break your app in the future. Why would they change the resource names anyway?(the images behind them sure, but the names?) How do I access ic_menu_login then? Is there a better reason not to than the above?

@CONTENT:I'm having some values that I need to format into a currency string. It seems that when using NSNumberFormatter to format an amount, the resulting currency string will contain one or more blank spaces. For instance using the following piece of code to format @"1000" into the European currency format will result in returning @"1,000,00 £á". Note the blank space before the currency symbol. NSNumberFormatter *tempNumberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];

 NSNumber *number = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[value doubleValue]];

 NSString *result = [tempNumberFormatter stringFromNumber:number];

 [tempNumberFormatter release];

 // result  = 1.000,00 £á 
 I first thought to solve this easily by just filtering the spaces out of the string but for some reason this does not work, the following piece of code is not doing what I was expecting: [result replaceOccurrencesOfString:@" " withString:@"" options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [result length])];
 Is there any way using NSNumberFormatter to return the formatted string without blanc spaces in it ? (1.000,00£á)
@CODE:@"1000" @"1,000,00 £á" NSNumberFormatter *tempNumberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
 [tempNumberFormatter setFormatterBehavior:NSNumberFormatterBehavior10_4];
 [tempNumberFormatter setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle];
 [tempNumberFormatter setLocale:[NSLocale currentLocale]];
 [tempNumberFormatter setGeneratesDecimalNumbers:YES];
 [tempNumberFormatter setMaximumFractionDigits:2];
 [tempNumberFormatter setMinimumFractionDigits:2];
 [tempNumberFormatter setAlwaysShowsDecimalSeparator:YES];

 NSString *value = @"1000";

 NSNumber *number = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[value doubleValue]];

 NSString *result = [tempNumberFormatter stringFromNumber:number];

 [tempNumberFormatter release];

 // result  = 1.000,00 £á [result replaceOccurrencesOfString:@" " withString:@"" options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [result length])]; 1.000,00£á double float floatValue numberWithDouble: float double [NSNumber numberWithDouble:1000.0]

@TITLE:argument order in cygwin gcc 4.3 matters when linking with glib-2.0
@CONTENT:I am trying to compile code that works on os x and linux using cygwin. However, I am finding that the argument order to gcc gives unanticipated results. For example, the following fails: gcc -std=gnu99 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include -lglib-2.0 -lintl -liconv -fgnu89-inline -fno-leading-underscore -o nb-learn.exe nb-learn.c
 but the following works: gcc -std=gnu99 -fgnu89-inline -fno-leading-underscore -o nb-learn.exe nb-learn.c -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include -lglib-2.0 -lintl -liconv
 Can someone explains how this works? Also, are there techniques or code I can look at for getting autoconf to change the argument order depending on the platform? Here are the first two lines of the error message: /cygdrive/c/Users/aischein/AppData/Local/Temp/cc9MvUsf.o:nb-learn.c:(.text+0x260): undefined reference to `_g_hash_table_size'

@TITLE:jeditable dynamic target value
@CONTENT:I'm using jeditable and it works really great! I'm just having some trouble figuring out how to dynamically change the target URL. jeditable is bound to a table of values that I want to edit inline. So I have: <td id="<%= col.id %>_<%= i.id %>" class="edit">
 The id is a mashup of two values I need to know to edit this item on the server side. My js is:     $(document).ready(function() {
 $('.edit').editable("/items/1", {
  id         : "column_id_item_id",

   submitdata : function(value, settings){
           return { data_template_id: '<%= @data_template.id%>}',  format : 'json'}
  } ,
  method     : 'PUT',  
 });
 });
 Note the target url is "/items/1" That /1 is what I need to change, and its one of the values built in to the td's id. So my question is how do I take the value from the id of the element clicked and use it to modify the target parameter for jeditable. Everything else is working fine, I'll just edit item 1 every time right now :)
@CODE:<td id="<%= col.id %>_<%= i.id %>" class="edit"> $(document).ready(function() {

@TITLE:What are the other new features of C# 4.0, after dynamic and optional parameters?
@CONTENT:So, C# 4.0 came out yesterday. It introduced the much-debated dynamic keyword, named and optional parameters. Smaller improvements were the implicit ref and recognizing of indexed and default properties on COM methods, contra- and co-variance (really a .NET CLR feature, not C# only) and... Is that really it? Are dynamic and optional/named params the only real improvements to C#? Or did I miss something? Not that I'm complaining, but it seems a bit meager after C# 2.0 (generics) and C# 3.0 (lambda, LINQ). Maybe the language just reached actual maturity?

 I looked through the documentation, and I believe that I cannot use "initWithNibName:" because it is being retrieved from the web. What I believe I need to do is save the .XIB to the app's document directory, and then use "loadNibFile:externalNameTable:withZone:" Essentially what I want to do is have an iPad application, and there is a small 320x480 window, where a .XIB loaded from the web can be displayed. If I can attach it locally to a ViewController all the better, but not completely necessary. I'm just not exactly sure how I should use "loadNibFile:externalNameTable:withZone:" Can anyone give me some advice or an example? Thanks in advance!

@CONTENT:I know there is probably a simple thing I'm missing, but I've been beating my head against the wall for the past hour or two. I have a database for the Android application I'm currently working on (Android v1.6) and I just want to insert a single record into a database table. My code looks like the following: //Save information to my table
sql =   "INSERT INTO table1 (field1, field2, field3) " +
        "VALUES (" + field_one + ", " + field_two + ")";
Log.v("Test Saving", sql);
myDataBase.rawQuery(sql, null);
 the myDataBase variable is a SQLiteDatabase object that can select data fine from another table in the schema. The saving appears to work fine (no errors in LogCat) but when I copy the database from the device and open it in sqlite browser the new record isn't there. I also tried manually running the query in sqlite browser and that works fine. The table schema for table1 is _id, field1, field2, field3. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

@TITLE:Object hierarchy returned by WCF Service is different than expected
@CONTENT:My understanding may be wrong, but I thought once you applied the correct attributes the DataContractSerializer would render fully-qualified instances back to the caller. The code runs and the objects return. But oddly enough, once I look at the returned objects I noticed the namespacing disappeared and the object-hierarchy being exposed through the (web applications) service reference seems to become "flat" (somehow). Now, I expect this from a web-service¡Kbut not through WCF. Of course, my understanding of what WCF can do may be wrong. ...please keep in mind I'm still experimenting with all this.

@TITLE:Relative path from an ASP.NET user control NavigateUrl
@CONTENT:I have a user control that contains a GridView. The GridView has both a HyperLinkField column and a template column that contains a HyperLink control. The ASP.NET project is structured as follows, with the Default.aspx page in each case using the user control. Application Root Controls UserControl with GridView SystemAdminFolder Default.aspx Edit.aspx OrganisationAdminFolder Default.aspx Edit.aspx StandardUserFolder Default.aspx Edit.aspx Note: The folders are being used to ensure the user has the correct role. I need to be able to set the DataNavigateUrlFormatString for the HyperLinkField and the NavigateUrl for the HyperLink to resolve to the Edit.aspx page in the corresponding folder. If I set the navigate URL to "Edit.aspx" the URL in the browser appears as 'http://Application Root/Controls/Edit.aspx' regardless of the originating directory. I can't use the Web application root operator (~/) as the path needs to be relative to the current page, not the application root. How can I use the same user control in multiple folders and resolve the URL to another page in the same folder? Note: The question is strongly based off a similar question by azhar2000s on the asp.net forums that matches my problem.

@TITLE:Union on two tables with a where clause in the one
@CONTENT:Currently I have 2 tables, both of the tables have the same structure and are going to be used in a web application. the two tables are production and temp. The temp table contains one additional column called [signed up]. Currently I generate a single list using two columns that are found in each table (recno and name). Using these two fields I'm able to support my web application search function. Now what I need to do is support limiting the amount of items that can be used in the search on the second table. the reason for this is become once a person is "signed up" a similar record is created in the production table and will have its own recno. doing: Select recno, name
  from production
UNION ALL
Select recno, name
  from temp
 ...will show me everyone. I have tried: Select recno, name
  from production
UNION ALL
Select recno, name
  from temp
 WHERE signup <> 'Y'
 But this returns nothing? Can anyone help?

@TITLE:Is there a programming toolkit for converting ¡§any file type¡¨ to a TIFF image?
@CONTENT:I've written several variations of a program. The purpose of the program is to convert "any file type" to a TIFF image represenation of that file, as if it were being printed using a printer. I'm currently using a third party printer driver that I send files to, and it outputs a TIFF image. This is nice, but it requires me to use Office Interop files, and interact with each individual processing application in order to print the files. I had previously tried a toolkit, called Apose .NET, which did not rely on Office Interop, and did not require any printer driver. It did the conversion all on its own and would create a TIFF image. The problem with Aspose .NET was that it did not support a wide variety of input file types. Most notably, it can't do Visio files. My project calls for the ability to create a TIFF image for virtually "any file type". (excluding exes, music files, and stuff) I know that finding something that handles literally any file type is probably not a very feasible task, so I figure if it can at least handle all the Office file types, Adobe types, and other major standard file types, then I can write a custom extension parsing module that uses those processing applications to do the printing of any file type that can be viewed using those applications. So, does anyone know of a toolkit that can do this? Preferably one that does not rely on Office or a printer driver. It does not have to be free, or open source. Or, if you know of an amazing printer driver that does this, I'm open to that too. Thanks in advance, Ryan

@TITLE:MSMQ Inconsistent State After Restart
@CONTENT:I'm seeing a really strange error that I'm having a difficult time tracking down. I think its related to my configuration of Rhino ESB, though I'm not sure if RSB is actually causing it, so I figured I'd ask and see if anyone else has come across this in any other usages of MSMQ. I'm using RSB as a client in a web app (ASP.NET, the client runs in the background). The client talks to a windows service via the MSMQ binding for RSB. Restarting the service never appears to have an effect on MSMQ, neither does restarting IIS by hand. However, whenever I actually restart the computer itself, MSMQ always refuses to start back up, claiming that a "queue is in an inconsistent state". Attempting to start MSMQ manually results in the same error, effectively rendering the MSMQ install completely useless. The only way to solve it is to actually remove then reinstall MSMQ. The only information I've found via the almighty Google are references to a problem in MSMQ 2.0 (this problem is occurring in MSMQ 4.0). I've verified that Dispose is being called on on the bus at shutdown, in both the service and the web site. Does anyone have any idea why this could be occurring? Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/2579515/how-to-catch-exception-on-rollback
@TITLE:How to catch exception on RollBack
@CONTENT:What is the best way to implement error handling for a SqlTransaction RollBack that already exists within a catch clause? My code is roughly like this: using (SqlConnection objSqlConn = new SqlConnection(connStr)) {
  objSqlConn.Open();

  using (SqlTransaction objSqlTrans = objSqlConn.BeginTransaction()) {
    try {
      // code
      // more code
      // and more code
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
      // What happens if RollBack() has an exception?
      objSqlTrans.Rollback();
      throw ex;
    }
  }
}
 I believe that my application had an exception in the try block, which in turn was caught in the catch block and then the RollBack was attempted. However, the error that I'm seeing says something about a SqlTransaction.ZombieCheck(), which is making me wonder if the RollBack() itself threw an exception as well. So, do I need to implement some type of error handling at the RollBack()? How do I do that and manage to hold on to the exception that put the execution into the catch block in the first place?

@TITLE:Android beginner: Touch events in android gridview
@CONTENT:I am using the following code to do things with gridview(slightly modified from http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-gridview.html). I want to replace the onClicklistener and the onClick() method with their "touch" equivalents i.e. touchlistener and onTouch() so that when i touch an element in the gridview the image of the element changes and a double touch on the same element takes it back to the orginal state. How do I do this? I can't get my code to do this. The clicklistener works to some extent but the touch isn't. Please help. public class ImageAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
private Context mContext;

    mContext = c;

@TITLE:how to reconcile conflict between original and generated file within Java web services?
@CONTENT:I have a legacy Java application that uses class mypackage.Foo. I would like that application to utilize a web service that returns instances of Foo. To connect to this web service, I use wsimport on the WSDL to generate the artifacts, and it gives me another Foo.java file. Ideally, I would like to tell wsimport to generate artifacts that use the original Foo and to not generate any additional Foo files, but I haven't found way to do that. How do I reconcile the two Foo files within the Java application? It seems my options are: 1) put the generated Foo file in another package. But then assigning otherpackage.Foo to a mypackage.Foo variable fails 2) use the generated Foo instead of the original Foo. In some cases, this would seem the best solution, but the original Foo has functionality that is not in the generated Foo. Besides, making an application-wide change is not feasible. 3) use the first option and write a method to manually copy the fields of otherpackage.Foo into mypackage.Foo. If all else fails, this will be what I do, but seems horribly inelegant. I'm sure I'm missing a simple best practice out there. Appreciate any insights!

@TITLE:NSDate dateFromString, how to parse 'around' UTC, GMT and User locale?
@CONTENT:I parse some values from an xml file. There is a @"25-12-2010'T'23:40:00"string with the time and date and there is a string with the GMT offset like this @"+0200". So the above time is the 25. of December 23:40:00 in timeZone +0200 GMT. (or 21:40 UTC) I have lots of these dates with different GMT offsets. I have to display these dates as they are, i.e. They must not be changed to fit the locale of the user. So if time 1: is 22:45 +0500 then that is what I must show the user, even if the user is in a different timezone. I have all sorts of trouble with displaying, calculating and parsing these strings. If I use a dateFormatter and dateFromString the user specific GMT info will be included in the resulting NSDate meaning the above will be saved as 23:40:00 +0100 GMT because that is my phones setting and maybe 23:40:00 ?0400 on a user from new New York's phone. When I subsequently do subtraction, addition and comparisons between these dates I have to keep the GMT offset around and everything gets worse if the phone switches locale settings, from when the date was parsed to when the date is displayed... Is there a way for me to extract this date from the string as UTC, then save it as an interval instead of an actual (timezone dependent) date. I know that is how dates are always saved internally. But I can't figure out how to do it with the separate GMT string and taking into account the users locale. Cheers

@LINK:/questions/2533112/how-to-manage-multiple-versions-of-the-same-record
@TITLE:How to manage multiple versions of the same record
@CONTENT:I am doing short-term contract work for a company that is trying to implement a check-in/check-out type of workflow for their database records. Here's how it should work... A user creates a new entity within the application. There are about 20 related tables that will be populated in addition to the main entity table. Once the entity is created the user will mark it as the master. Another user can make changes to the master only by "checking out" the entity. Multiple users can checkout the entity at the same time. Once the user has made all the necessary changes to the entity, they put it in a "needs approval" status. After an authorized user reviews the entity, they can promote it to master which will put the original record in a tombstoned status. The way they are currently accomplishing the "check out" is by duplicating the entity records in all the tables. The primary keys include EntityID + EntityDate, so they duplicate the entity records in all related tables with the same EntityID and an updated EntityDate and give it a status of "checked out". When the record is put into the next state (needs approval), the duplication occurs again. Eventually it will be promoted to master at which time the final record is marked as master and the original master is marked as dead. This design seems hideous to me, but I understand why they've done it. When someone looks up an entity from within the application, they need to see all current versions of that entity. This was a very straightforward way for making that happen. But the fact that they are representing the same entity multiple times within the same table(s) doesn't sit well with me, nor does the fact that they are duplicating EVERY piece of data rather than only storing deltas. I would be interested in hearing your reaction to the design, whether positive or negative. I would also be grateful for any resoures you can point me to that might be useful for seeing how someone else has implemented such a mechanism. Thanks! Darvis

        }   
    }
}
 Problem is those # of nested loops are optimized for 3-spot permutations. How can I could I dynamically set the number of nested for loops to generate 4-letter or 5-letter permutations?

        }   
    }
}

@TITLE:Display both jQuery validation summary and individual error messages
@CONTENT:I'm using jQuery validation in ASP.net MVC. I would like to show validation summary and also individual error messages besides the control. I can do either one at a time. So it would be really helpful to know how can I display both.

@TITLE:SPP Socket createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord will not connect
@CONTENT:I want to use Android 2.1 to connect to an external Bluetooth device, wich is offering an SPP port to me. In this case it is an external GPS unit. When I'm trying to connect I can't connect an established socket while being in the "client" mode. Then if I try to set up a socket (being in the server role), to RECEIVE text from my PC everything works just fine. The Computer can connect as the client to the Socket on the Phone via SPP using the SSP UUID or some random UUID. So the Problem is not that I'm using the wrong UUID. But the other way around (e.g. calling connect on the established client socket) createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(UUID uuid)) just doesn't work. Sadly I don't have the time to inspect the problem further. It would be greate If somebody could point me the right way. Phone: Samsung Galaxy Spica I-5700 Android 2.1 In the following part of the Logfile has to be the Problem. Greets PhilDev P.S. I'm going to be present during the Office hours.

@LINK:/questions/2510574/getting-a-handle-on-gis-math-where-do-i-start
@TITLE:Getting a handle on GIS math, where do I start?
@CONTENT:I am in charge of a program that is used to create a set of nodes and paths for consumption by an autonomous ground vehicle. The program keeps track of the locations of all items in its map by indicating the item's position as being x meters north and y meters east of an origin point of 0,0. In the real world, the vehicle knows the location of the origin's lat and long, as it is determined by a dgps system and is accurate down to a couple centimeters. My program is ignorant of any lat long coordinates. It is one of my goals to modify the program to keep track of lat long coords of items in addition to an origin point and items' x,y position in relation to that origin. At first blush, it seems that I am going to modify the program to allow the lat long coords of the origin to be passed in, and after that I desire that the program will automatically calculate the lat long of every item currently in a map. From what I've researched so far, I believe that I will need to figure out the math behind converting to lat long coords from a UTM like projection where I specify the origin points and meridians etc as opposed to whatever is defined already for UTM. I've come to ask of you GIS programmers, am I on the right track? It seems to me like there is so much to wrap ones head around, and I'm not sure if the answer isn't something as simple as, "oh yea theres a conversion from meters to lat long, here" Currently, due to the nature of DGPS, the system really doesn't need to care about locations more than oh, what... 40 km? radius away from the origin. Given this, and the fact that I need to make sure that the error on my coordinates is not greater than .5 meters, do I need anything more complex than a simple lat/long to meters conversion constant? I'm knee deep in materials here. I could use some pointers about what concepts to research. Thanks much!

@TITLE:OutOfMemoryException - out of ideas
@CONTENT:I know there is no simple answer to my question but I would appreciate ideas, guides or some sort of things-to-look-at list I have a net Windows service that is constantly throwing OutOfMemoryException. The service has two builds for x86 and x64 Windows. However on x64 it consumes a lot more memory. I have tried profiling it with various memory profilers. But I cannot get a clue what the problem is. The diagnosis - service consumes lot of VMSize and crashes app after 3 to 12 hours. The behaviuor is rather stochastic - there is no observable pattern for crash scenario. Also I tried to look at performance counters (perfmon.exe). What I can see is that heap size is growing and %GC time is on average 19%. Plus memory allocation is correlated with %CPU time. My application has threads and locking objects, DB connections and WCF interface. The general question that I am trying to solve: Is it simply GC not been fast enough to GC objects or some non-managed (windows) objects are consuming memory?

If in the constructor of A, should I assume that allocations of class B and C never fail, and handle the bad allocation exception in the destructor of A? If I don't make that assumption, meaning that I add some try catch block to catch bad_alloc of class B and class C, then if the allocation exception occurs, should I do clean up in the constructor of A? What are the recommended practices? If "new" generates a bad allocation, what value does the pointer carry?

This is essentially my situation... (I've trimmed it down because if someone can help me to create this query I can take it from there.)

I know what all of the tag_id and category_id rows are. What I want to do is return a list of all the articles that article_tags and article_categories MAY have in common, ordered by the number of common entries. For example: article1 - tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 - categories: cat1, cat2 article2 - tags: tag2 - categories: cat1, cat2 article3 - tags: tag1, tag3 - categories: cat1 So if my article had "tag1" and "cat1 and cat2" it should return the articles in this order: article1 (tag1, cat1 and cat2 in common) article3 (tag1, cat1 in common) article2 (cat1 in common) Any help would genuinely be appreciated!

If I've miss-coded something it can take a long time to error or reach a break point. I can save the results to a sheet fine, it's when I am working with the record sets that things can blow up. Is there a way to load the data into a ADODB.Recordset when I'm debugging to skip querying the database (after the first time)? Would I use something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2086234/query-excel-worksheet-in-ms-access-vba-using-adodb-recordset

@TITLE:NHibernate with nothing but stored procedures
@CONTENT:I'd like to have NHibernate call a stored procedure when ISession.Get is called to fetch an entity by its key instead of using dynamic SQL. We have been using NHibernate and allowing it to generate our SQL for queries and inserts/updates/deletes, but now may have to deploy our application to an environment that requires us to use stored procedures for all database access. We can use sql-insert, sql-update, and sql-delete in our .hbm.xml mapping files for inserts/updates/deletes. Our hql and criteria queries will have to be replaced with stored procedure calls. However, I have not figured out how to force NHibernate to use a custom stored procedure to fetch an entity by its key. I still want to be able to call ISession.Get, as in: using (ISession session = MySessionFactory.OpenSession())
{
    return session.Get<Customer>(customerId);
}
 and also lazy load objects, but I want NHibernate to call my "GetCustomerById" stored procedure instead of generating the dynamic SQL. Can this be done? Perhaps NHibernate is no longer a fit given this new environment we must support.

@TITLE:using libcurl to check if a file exists on a SFTP site
@CONTENT:I'm using C++ with libcurl to do SFTP/FTPS transfers. Before uploading a file, I need to check if the file exists without actually downloading it. If the file doesn't exist, I run into the following problems: //set up curlhandle for the public/private keys and whatever else first.
curl_easy_setopt(CurlHandle, CURLOPT_URL, "sftp://user@pass:host/nonexistent-file");

 If I don't use CURLOPT_NOBODY, it works, I get CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND. However, if the file does exist, it gets downloaded, which wastes time for me, since I just want to know if it's there or not. Any other techniques/options I'm missing? Note that it should work for ftps as well. Edit: This error occurs with sftp. With FTPS/FTP I get CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE, which I can work with.

@CONTENT:I have two batch files which is used to run a large c+_+ build, the first one starts the processes, creating directories and figuring out what to send to the second script. If certain information is presented to the first script, I have a routine that pops up a window and asks for a password. This is passed to the second script by calling the second script like this call script2.bat -pw:myPassword
 where myPassword is something the user entered. now, i have been testing this script and one of my users password contains a semicolon, so we get this call script2.bat -pw:my;Password
 I found by putting in quotes I can get this into the second script OK call script2.bat -pw:"my;Password" However, the command line parsing breaks when I try to do this for /F "tokens=1,2 delims=:" %%a in ( "%1" ) DO SET switch=%%a&value=%%b
 if I echo %1 it shows like this -pw:"my;Password"
 But with echo on when the script runs I see for /F "tokens=1,2 delims=:" %%a in ( "-pw:"my Password"" ) DO SET switch=%%a&value=%%b
 and it parses as switch=-pw and value="my What I eventually need is for value to contain my;Password so I can pass it to another program Any ideas on how to get this to parse correctly Here re 2 batch file that issulstrate the problem: a.bat: echo on call b.bat -pw:eatme call b.bat -pw:eat;me call b.bat -pw:"eat;me" call "b.bat -pw:\"eat;me\"" b.bat: echo on echo %1 for /F "tokens=1,2 delims=: " %%a in ( "%1" ) DO SET switch=%%a&SET value=%%b echo switch=%switch% echo value=%value% Thanks ! joe

@TITLE:Salesforce/PHP - Bulk Outbound message (SOAP), Time out issue - See update #2
@CONTENT:Salesforce can send up to 100 requests inside 1 SOAP message. While sending this type of Bulk Ooutbound message request my PHP script finishes executing but SF fails to accept the ACK used to clear the message queue on the Salesforce side of things. Looking at the Outbound message log (monitoring) I see all the messages in a pending state with the Delivery Failure Reason "java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out". If my script has finished execution, why do I get this error? I have tried these methods to increase the execution time on my server as I have no access on the Salesforce side: set_time_limit(0); // in the script max_execution_time = 360 ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds max_input_time = 360 ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data memory_limit = 32M ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume I used the high settings just for testing. Any thoughts as to why this is failing the ACK delivery back to Salesforce? Here is some of the code: This is how I accept and send the ACK file for the imcoming SOAP request $data = 'php://input';
$content = file_get_contents($data);

if($content) {
    respond('true');
} else {
    respond('false');
}
 The respond function function respond($tf) {
    $ACK = <<<ACK

    print trim($ACK); 
}
 These are in a generic script that I include into the script that uses the data for a specific workflow. I can process about 25 requests (That are in 1 SOAP response) but once I go over that I get the timeout error in the Salesforce queue. for 50 requests is usually takes my PHP script 86.77 seconds. Could it be Apache? PHP? I have also tested just accepting the 100 request SOAP response and just accepting and sending the ACK the queue clears out, so I know it's on my side of things. I show no errors in the apache log, the script runs fine. I did find some info on the Salesforce site but still no luck. Here is the link. Also I'm using the PHP Toolkit 11 (From Salesforce). Other forum with good SF help Thanks for any insight into this, --Phill UPDATE: If I receive the incoming message and print the response, should this happen first regardless if I do anything else after? Or does it wait for my process to finish and then print the response? UPDATE #2: okay I think I have the problem: PHP uses the single thread processing approach and will not send back the ACK file until the thread has completed it's processing. Is there a way to make this a mutli thread process? Thread #1 - accept the incoming SOAP request and send back the ACK Thread #2 - Process the SOAP request I know I could break it up into like a DB table or flat file, but is there a way to accomplish this without doing that? I'm going to try to close the socket after the ACK submission and continue the processing, cross my fingers it will work.

@TITLE:Getting Started with Ruby & Ruby on Rails
@CONTENT:Some background: I'm a jack-of-all trades, one of which is programming. I learned VB6 through Excel and PHP for creating websites and so far it's worked out just fine for me. I'm not CS major or even mathematically inclined - logic is what interests me. Current status: I'm willing to learn new and more powerful languages; my first foray into such a route is learning Ruby. I went to the main Ruby website and did the interactive intro. (by the way, I'm currently getting redirected to google.com when I try the link...it's happening to other websites as well...is my computer infected?) I liked what I learned and wanted to get started using Ruby to create websites. I downloaded InstantRails and installed it; everything so far has been fine - the program starts up just fine, and I can test some Ruby code in the console. However my troubles begin when I try and view a web page with Ruby code present. Lastly, my problem: As in PHP, I can browse to the .php file directly and through using PHP tags and some simple 'echo' statements I can be on my way in making dynamic web pages. However with the InstantRails app working, accessing a .rb or .rhtml page doesn't produce similar results. I made a simple text file named 'test.rb' and put basic HTML tags in there (html, head, body) and the Ruby tags <%= and %> with some ruby code inside. The web page actually shows the tags and the code - as if it's all just plain HTML. I take it Ruby isn't parsing the page before it is displayed to the user, but this is where my lack of understanding of the Ruby environment stops me short. Where do I go from here? AMMENDMENT: This tutorial has helped me immensely! I'd suggest anyone who's in my position go there.

Currently I am creating them in another directory inside my project and then copying them into App_Code. is there any way around this? [Update] I've posted an "answer" below. Technically this answers the question as based on my own specification, the use of tools (i.e. intellisense) should not be required to create plugins. However, this did prompt a question of how I may achieve a dynamically compiled plugin framework without using App_Code. Since this question is so different from the original, I will raise it separately.

@CONTENT:From reading the Apple Docs on Core Data, I've learned that you should not use Core Data when you need a dynamic schema. If I wanted to provide the user the ability to create their own properties, in a core data model would it work if I created some "dummy" attributes like "custom decimal 1", "custom decimal 2", "custom text 1", "custom text 2" etc that the user could name and use for their own purposes? Obviously this won't work for relationships, but for simple properties it seems like a reasonable workaround. Will creating a bunch of dummy attributes on my entities that go unused by most users noticeably decrease performance for them? Have any of you tried something like this? Thanks!

@CONTENT:Which processors are capable of running Common Intermediate Language(CIL), formerly known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL)? Clearly any machine that can run Microsoft Windows with .net qualifies as well as machines targeted by the Mono project. It would appear that the .NET Micro Framework has the ability to target other processors not covered by the above, but it is not clear to me that it uses CIL. Does anyone have a list of which processors are capable of running a program in CIL and or interpreting C# directly (as the .NET Micro Framework appears to do)? EDIT to clarify, I understand that CLI is not executed directly on the metal but rather by a a runtime engine. So for this question any processor with a runtime engine that executes CIL qualifies.

@LINK:/questions/2436306/calendar-day-view-in-php
@TITLE:Calendar Day View in PHP
@CONTENT:I'm working on adding a day view option to an existing calendar solution. Like many people implementing their own calendars, I am trying to model Google Calendars. They have an excellent calendar solution and their day view provides a lot of flexibility. For most part, the implementation is going well; however, I'm having issues when it comes to conflicting events. Essentially, I want the events to share the same space, side by side. Events that start at the same time should have the longest event first. In the example data set I'm working with, I have four events: A: 10:30 - 11:30 B: 13:30 - 14:30 C: 10:30 - 11:00 D: 10:45 - 14:00 I can handle A, C, and D just fine, the problem comes with D. A should be left of C which should be left of D; each taking one third of the width (it's fixed width so I can do simple math to figure that out). The problem is that B should be under A and C, to the left of D. Ideally, B would take up the same amount of space as A and C (two thirds width), but I would even settle for it only taking up only one third width. My array of events looks similar to the following: $events = array(
  '1030' => array(
    'uniqueID1' => array(
      'start_time' => '1030',
      'end_time' => '1130',
    ),
    'uniqueID2' => array(
      'start_time' => '1030',
      'end_time' => '1100',
    ),
  ),
  '1045' => array(
    'uniqueID3' => array(
      'start_time' => '1045',
      'end_time' => '1400',
    ),
  ),
  '1330' => array(
    'uniqueID3' => array(
      'start_time' => '1330',
      'end_time' => '1430',
    ),
  ),
);
 My plan is to add some indexes to each event that include how many events it conflicts with (so I can calculate the width) and which position in that series it should be (so I can calculate the left value). However, that doesn't help the B. I'm thinking I might need an algorithm that uses some basic geometry and matrices, but I'm not sure where to begin. Any help is greatly appreciated.
@CODE:$events = array(
  '1030' => array(
    'uniqueID1' => array(
      'start_time' => '1030',

    UIImage *image = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];
    NSData *imageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(image);

    // Create a file name for the image
    NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
    [dateFormatter setTimeStyle:NSDateFormatterShortStyle];
    [dateFormatter setDateStyle:NSDateFormatterShortStyle];
    NSString *imageName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"photo-%@.png",
                           [dateFormatter stringFromDate:[NSDate date]]];
    [dateFormatter release];

    // Find the path to the documents directory
    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];

    // Now we get the full path to the file
    NSString *fullPathToFile = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:imageName];

    // Write out the data.

    [self.managedObject setValue:fullPathToFile forKey:@"imageLocation"];
    NSError *error = nil;
    [[self.managedObject managedObjectContext] save:&error];


    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}
 Then here is how I try to load it: self.imageView.backgroundColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor];
self.imageView.frame = CGRectMake(10, 10, 72, 72);
if ([self.managedObject valueForKey:@"imageLocation"] != nil) {
    NSLog(@"Trying to load the imageView with: %@", [self.managedObject valueForKey:@"imageLocation"]);

    self.imageView.image = image;

} else {
    self.imageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"no_picture_taken.png"];
}
 I get the message that it's trying to load the imageView in the debugger, but the image is never displayed in the imageView. Can anyone tell me what I've got wrong here? Thanks a bunch.

@TITLE:Can I get a WPF ListBox to inherit brushes from parent element?
@CONTENT:My WPF window has its foreground brush set to a brush from a resource dictionary, and I want all text in the window to have this color, so I don't touch the foreground brush in anything else. Textboxes get the color Textblocks get the color Buttons get the color Listboxes do not get the color, and so neither do their contents. Is there any way to get a Listbox to behave like the other controls in this respect? Assuming not, and that this is by design, what is the rationale? Edit: It seems my question is not clear enough. I understand how to create styles and resources and apply them to ListBoxes; I'm wondering why I need to do this for certain controls when I do not need to for others -- why some inherit properties and others do not -- and whether there is any way to make them all inherit in the same way.

@TITLE:Adding iPod Support to (previously) iPhone Only App
@CONTENT:When I started on my current project, there was already an App in the App Store. This App was iPhone only. My first task was to test and build a version that also ran on an iPod Touch. About 3 weeks ago Apple removed the option on iTunes connect to set the device requirements. And sent an email out to all developers: "The App Store requires that you provide metadata about your application before submitting it. While most of this metadata is specified using the iPhone Developer Program Portal, the process for selecting device-related dependencies in iTunes Connect is no longer available. Instead, if your app relies on features that are specific to a device, such as the compass on iPhone 3GS, add the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities key to your app's Info.plist file to indicate the specific hardware feature required." When I compiled the iPod compatible version I set the device requirements (UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities) in the info.plist to: location-services (gps or skyhook) wi-fi (any device) However, as the App was originally uploaded and the option for "iPhone only" set in iTunes connect this appears to be the default. The kicker is, because Apple have removed this feature there is no way to change it! Has anyone come up against this problem? And how did you solve it? Is it possible I have incorrect values in UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities? UPDATE: The app will run fine on a iPod Touch if installed as a development version via Xcode. The problem is on the App Store it is listed as iPhone only and when iPod Touch users search in the App store no results are returned.

@CONTENT:Having successfully reorganized my project for ocamlbuild with subdirectories and using ocamlfind, I've found it difficult to build the top-level. I've constructed a .mltop file containing all the modules that would be included and added the packages to the _tags, but the build doesn't work. It cannot find the C functions that are compiled with one of the modules. With -classic-display on, I can see that file, libcside.a, not being included and isn't even being compiled at all! The c file is added as a dependency in myocamlbuild.ml by, flag ["link"; "ocaml"; "use_cutil"] (S [A"-cclib"; A"-L."; ]);

 Develop pseudocode that accepts as input the name of an unspecified number of masqueraders who each have paid the full cost of their costume and the amount each has paid. A masquerader may have paid for a costume in any of the five sections in the band. The algorithm should determine the section in which the masquerader plays, based on the amount he/she has paid for the costume. The algorithm should also determine the number of masqueraders who have paid for costumes in each section. The names of persons and the section for which they have paid should be printed. A listing of the sections and the total number of persons registered to play in each section should also be printed, along with the total amount paid in each section.

@CONTENT:i am wondering if there is any way i can create an app that starts as a desktop application, for personal use for now. and since desktop applications can work with my HDD files which i may want to manage but don't feel secure throwing them onto a web server. but what i think i may want to do in the future is port the app to the web since that is where i think is the future of applications to come. web apps are available everywhere eg. web apps can be used on smart phones etc. facilitate team collaboration etc. i have looked at some technologies but all seem to have some disadvantages Adobe AIR 2 Advantages Use of existing web technologies make it easy for me (mainly a web developer) to design and develop applications based on HTML5, CSS3, JS (jQuery, Dojo) which can be ported to a web platform in the future with greater ease can access file system Disadvantages i guess speed maybe an issue i may encounter limitations with what can be done in JS (vs languages like C#, Python, Java etc) C#/F#/WPF/EF/LINQ Advantages C#/F# powerful languages EF/LINQ makes data access very simple WPF provides good data binding, styling capabilities Disadvantages WPF harder to use/learn than what i already know (HTML/CSS/JS) WPF abit more complex Harder to port over to a web platform (... maybe with a .NET platform its still ok? but i think Open Source PHP/Apache is more widely used) Silverlight (Out of Browser) Advantages C#/F# more powerful than JS Disadvantages complexities of WPF vs HTML/CSS Mozilla Framework i dont know much about this option yet Advantages XUL as a layout tool, i guess provides more flexibilities than HTML? uses CSS/JS existing web technologies so porting maybe still quite straightforward i think it can use native API/Code tho i dont know how it works yet in general, i think it will be a more powerful option over adobe air Disadvantages Architecture of software seems messy, chrome folders etc? i think WPF seems like a much more powerful and elegant option compared to this? i have seen QT-Webkit too, but same as Mozilla Framework, WPF seems like a much more powerful and elegant option just FYI, i am thinking of building a Project Management/Organizer type application. most parts of it i think it will work on a web platform except i wanted to integrate features like screen capture, managing project files, resources (eg. web site inspirations, resources like fonts, videos, etc). i am also exploring Adobe XMP to add metadata to files (images, videos etc).

@TITLE:Android : ugly TABS in 2.0 vs 1.5 ¡K why ? where are my rounded corners TABS?
@CONTENT:I simply use the tabwidget : mTabHost = getTabHost();

    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_1").setIndicator(getString(R.string.day0)).setContent(R.id.tab1_content));
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_2").setIndicator(getString(R.string.day1)).setContent(R.id.tab2_content));
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_3").setIndicator(getString(R.string.day2)).setContent(R.id.tab3_content));
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_4").setIndicator(getString(R.string.day3)).setContent(R.id.tab4_content));
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_5").setIndicator(getString(R.string.about)).setContent(R.id.tab5_content));

    mTabHost.setCurrentTab(0);
 Why are my tabs so uggly in 2.0 (no more rounded corners as in 1.5/1.6) ? ugly tabs here => this was better What should I do now to show "rounded corners" TABS to Nexus One (for exemple) users ;-) ? Is it because of the following manifest lines : <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="3" 
          android:targetSdkVersion="4" />

<supports-screens android:smallScreens="true"  
                  android:normalScreens="true"  
                  android:largeScreens="true"  
                  android:anyDensity="true" />
 I have to keep android:anyDensity="true" otherwise I've got a problem with re-sizing of the menus described here As a separate question, my users can change the Locale within my app itself, I then "redraw" the menus using onPrepareOptionsMenu (Menu menu) to refresh the strings within the menu with the new language choosen by the user. Is there an equivalent for TABS (I have local strings within the Title of the TABS) or do I have to delete all the tabs and re-create them from scratch ? Txs in advance for your help. Hub

@TITLE:SQL Server: How to ignore referential integrity until COMMIT?
@CONTENT:i have a process to move rows from one database to another. Because of some circular foreign key reference chains i cannot remove the rows from the old database, nor can i insert them into the new database. Since the entire operation happens in a transaction1, i want SQL Server to ignore referential integrity failures until i call COMMIT TRANSACTION. For example2:    Table: Turboencabulators         Table: Marselvanes
   =========================        =======================
PK TurboencabulatorID int    /-> PK MarselvaneID       int
^  MarselvanesID      int --/       HasGrammeter       bit
|                                   PantametricFan     varchar(50)
+-------------------------------    TurboencabulatorID int
 If i try to insert the turboencabulator in the new table, it will fail without the marselvane already being there. Reversing the order has the same problem. When trying to remove the old rows, i cannot delete one until the other is deleted. i've tried doing an n-phase system, where all rows are inserted with any columns that are under foreign key constraint set to null. Then i update all the inserted rows, placing the proper missing values. Then, in order to delete the source rows, i null off all columns affected by a FK, then delete the actual rows.3 What i'd really prefer is to just do my T-SQL operations, and have SQL Server not tell me until i try to call commit. Notes 1distributed 2contrived hypothetical 3which i'm not doing anymore
@CODE:COMMIT TRANSACTION Table: Turboencabulators         Table: Marselvanes

@TITLE:RichFaces rich:panelMenu stops working when a4j:include'd
@CONTENT:From this previously asked question, I have noticed that when I move a rich:panelMenu (which works fine when in an index.jsp page) into another.jsp and then include that in index.jsp using an a4j:include tag, the rich:panelMenu functionality stops working. Is this a bug? EDIT 1 In response to code and after some isolation testing, the problem appears to stem from a coexistence of a rich:dataTable in another tab of a rich:tabPanel from the panelMenu. If my index.jsp contains a default simple panelMenu using demo code (inc in the bean) it works as expected: <f:view>

 But if I remove the added panelMenu from this file and paste it into a separate tab in a tabPanel in an external jsp page which is then a4j:included in the above index.jsp, when it's loaded, the panelMenu refuses to work (outputting nothing to the log or console) while in the other tab in my tab set there is a rich:dataTable. With the exact same code, but with the dataTable removed from the second tab, it all starts working again.

@TITLE:Google App Engine - Spring Security Issue (java.security.AccessControlException)
@CONTENT:I'm currently getting the AccessControlException below when I deploy to app engine (I don't see it when I run in my local environment). I'm using GAE 1.3.1, Spring 3.0.1, and Spring Security 3.0.2. Any ideas how to get around this issue? It appears to be an issue with Spring Security trying to get the system class loader, but I'm not sure how to work around this. Nested in org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'org.springframework.security.filterChainProxy': Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.lang.RuntimePermission getClassLoader):

@LINK:/questions/2325676/core-data-deleteobject-crashes-are-delete-rules-the-cause
@TITLE:Core Data: -deleteObject: Crashes, Are Delete Rules the Cause?
@CONTENT:I have the following model, as you can see in the image. My application requires refreshing every instance of B, so at each viewWillAppear, I need to delete all the B's in the model. Upon deleting a B, the cascade delete rule on the relationship to C will delete all C and then cascade to all D. A & E are constants. I have the DeleteRule on each object as follows: A: b - Cascade
B: c - Cascade, a - Nullify
C: b - Nullify, d - Cascade
D: c - Nullify, e - Nullify
E: d - Cascade
 or A -(cascade)->> B -(cascade)-> C -(cascade)->> D -(nullify)-> E
A <-(nullify)- B <-(nullify)- C <-(nullify)- D <-(nullify) E
 I am having problem with cascading the delete on all B,C,D. My fetchRequest object returns every instance of B in A and then I call the -deleteObject: on each B from the managedObjectContext. But there is the EXC_BAD_ACCESS on the call to [managedObjectContext save:&error]. Can someone show me what I am doing wrong? Am I having problems with the DeleteRule on each entity or does the problem lay elsewhere? What are the best practices to handle the cascading deletes on three objects B,C,D?

@TITLE:How to dispatch work items to a single thread
@CONTENT:Sorry this question is not very clear, if I know the correct words to describe the problem, Google would be likely to come up with the answer. I am looking for a queue class that: Lets any number of threads put an item on the queue Items are processed in the order they are added to the queue I don¡¦t mind what thread process an item Only one item is processed at a time. I rather not have a thread blocked waiting for an item to be added to the queue if there are no items on the queue. The normal case is for the queue to be empty most of the time. e.g Just like what happens with a BeginInvoke on a WinForms windows... (Or PostMessage if you have every done raw win32 programming) We are using .net 3.5 I am looking for something ready-made in the .net framework, or a open source project that has good unit tests, as I don't wish to have to write all the unit tests for a home-make solution. For background, see Why are my message be processed out of order over a single WCF TCP channel (with ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant)? by using this depatcher I was able to change to using ConcurrencyMode.Single and still advoid deadlocks.

@TITLE:A string searching algorithm to quickly match an abbreviation in a large list of unabbreviated strings?
@CONTENT:I am having a lot of trouble finding a string matching algorithm that fits my requirements. I have a very large database of strings in an unabbreviated form that need to be matched to an arbitrary abbreviation. A string that is an actual substring with no letters between its characters should also match, and with a higher score. Example: if the word to be matched within was "download" and I searched "down", "ownl", and then "dl", I would get the highest matching score for "down", followed by "ownl" and then "dl". The algorithm would have to be optimized for speed and a large number of strings to be searched through, and should allow me to pull back a list of matching items strings (if I had added both "download" and "upload" to the database, searching "load" should return both). Memory is still important, but not as important as speed. Any ideas? I've done a bunch of research on some of these algorithms but I haven't found any that even touch abbreviations, let alone with all these conditions!

However, I am having trouble making the Sqlite in the build SEE the extension. The statically linked Sqlite library works fine. Also the .C extension works on my desktop, and builds fine as a statically linked library in Xcode. However, the custom functions it defines are missing when called. For example, I load the extension as so with no errors. SELECT load_extension('extension_name.so');
 But when I try to call a function defined in the extension, I get this message DB Error: 1 "no such function: custom_function"
 Does anyone know much about linking a Sqlite extension into an Xcode project?

@TITLE:Retrieve all association's attributes of an AR model?
@CONTENT:How do you think is the more optimum way to retrieve all the attributes for each association that an AR model has? i.e: let's say we have the model Target. class Target < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :countries
  has_many :cities
  has_many :towns
  has_many :colleges
  has_many :tags

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :countries, :cities, ...
end
 I'd like to retrieve all the association's attributes by calling a method on a Target instance: target.associations_attributes
>> { :countries => { "1" => { :name => "United States", :code => "US", :id => 1 }, 
                     "2" => { :name => "Canada", :code => "CA", :id => 2 } },
     :cities => { "1" => { :name => "New York", :region_id => 1, :id => 1 } },
     :regions => { ... },
     :colleges => { ... }, ....
   }
 Currently I make this work by iterating on each association, and then on each model of the association, But it's kind of expensive, How do you think I can optimize this? Just a note: I realized you can't call target.countries_attributes on has_many associations with nested_attributes, one_to_one associations allow to call target.country_attributes
@CODE:Target class Target < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :countries
  has_many :cities
  has_many :towns
  has_many :colleges
  has_many :tags

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :countries, :cities, ...
end target.associations_attributes

@CONTENT:I have an XML file which contains lists of stores, a simplified version is below. What I would like help with is some high-level ideas on the simplest ways to move this data into objects for storage in Core Data. I see suggestions around key-value pairs but as you can see in my example below, I have child elements with the same name/key and there can be an arbitrary number of these for each store element. I intend to store these objects within the app for future use (they will be annotations on a map). So, each duplicate field needs to be stored, one of them will not suffice. I know how to model it in Core Data I believe, I'll have a phone-number entity and a store entity and will just relate the two based on <store-id>. I'm just trying to use a simple method to move them from XML to Core Data via some other data structure. XML sample: <stores>
  <store>
   <store-id>1</store-id>
   <city>Dublin</city>
   <phone>011234567</phone>
   <phone>011234566</phone>

   <owner>Joe Bloggs</owner>

 If key-value pairs are the way to go, please point me to a method where I can account for the duplicate elements. If there's another way, I'm all ears. Thanks

@TITLE:Pause flash game using javascript
@CONTENT:I'm working on a flash gaming site, BeardedGames.com. I just recently implemented a "Panic" button that makes the entire site display: none and display: block's a iframe with a allowed in school website of the user's choice. It works well so far, but the user's flash game still runs in the background while hidden. Is there a way to pause (not reset) the game, that will work on most, if not all, flash games? It needs to be accessible from javascript (possibly just javascript, or a flash wrapper?), and it has to work in IE 6 and greater (I know... I know. Can't help it.). EDIT: Failed to make it clear that the user must be able to "un-pause" their game after the unpanic button is pressed. EDIT: I haven't made these games, these are already made games like linerider.

@CONTENT:In GAE, you can say users.get_current_user() to get the currently logged-in user implicit to the current request. This works even if multiple requests are being processed simultaneously -- the users module is somehow aware of which request the get_current_user function is being called on behalf of. I took a look into the code of the module in the development server, and it seems to be using os.environ to get the user email and other values associated to the current request. Does this mean that every request gets an independent os.environ object? I need to implement a service similar to users.get_current_user() that would return different values depending on the request being handled by the calling code. Assuming os.environ is the way to go, how do I know which variable names are already being used (or reserved) by GAE? Also, is there a way to add a hook (or event handler) that gets called before every request?

@TITLE:A string searching algorithm to quickly match an abbreviation in a large list of unabbreviated strings?
@CONTENT:I am having a lot of trouble finding a string matching algorithm that fits my requirements. I have a very large database of strings in an unabbreviated form that need to be matched to an arbitrary abbreviation. A string that is an actual substring with no letters between its characters should also match, and with a higher score. Example: if the word to be matched within was "download" and I searched "down", "ownl", and then "dl", I would get the highest matching score for "down", followed by "ownl" and then "dl". The algorithm would have to be optimized for speed and a large number of strings to be searched through, and should allow me to pull back a list of matching items strings (if I had added both "download" and "upload" to the database, searching "load" should return both). Memory is still important, but not as important as speed. Any ideas? I've done a bunch of research on some of these algorithms but I haven't found any that even touch abbreviations, let alone with all these conditions!

@CONTENT:I use a statically linked library for Sqlite in an iPhone Xcode project. I am now trying to include a .C extension to Sqlite in this project. However, I am having trouble making the Sqlite in the build SEE the extension. The statically linked Sqlite library works fine. Also the .C extension works on my desktop, and builds fine as a statically linked library in Xcode. However, the custom functions it defines are missing when called. For example, I load the extension as so with no errors. SELECT load_extension('extension_name.so');
 But when I try to call a function defined in the extension, I get this message DB Error: 1 "no such function: custom_function"
 Does anyone know much about linking a Sqlite extension into an Xcode project?

@TITLE:Retrieve all association's attributes of an AR model?
@CONTENT:How do you think is the more optimum way to retrieve all the attributes for each association that an AR model has? i.e: let's say we have the model Target. class Target < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :countries
  has_many :cities
  has_many :towns
  has_many :colleges
  has_many :tags

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :countries, :cities, ...
end
 I'd like to retrieve all the association's attributes by calling a method on a Target instance: target.associations_attributes
>> { :countries => { "1" => { :name => "United States", :code => "US", :id => 1 }, 
                     "2" => { :name => "Canada", :code => "CA", :id => 2 } },
     :cities => { "1" => { :name => "New York", :region_id => 1, :id => 1 } },
     :regions => { ... },
     :colleges => { ... }, ....
   }
 Currently I make this work by iterating on each association, and then on each model of the association, But it's kind of expensive, How do you think I can optimize this? Just a note: I realized you can't call target.countries_attributes on has_many associations with nested_attributes, one_to_one associations allow to call target.country_attributes
@CODE:Target class Target < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :countries
  has_many :cities
  has_many :towns
  has_many :colleges
  has_many :tags

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :countries, :cities, ...
end target.associations_attributes

@TITLE:What steps should be taken to convert my XML into Core Data objects?
@CONTENT:I have an XML file which contains lists of stores, a simplified version is below. What I would like help with is some high-level ideas on the simplest ways to move this data into objects for storage in Core Data. I see suggestions around key-value pairs but as you can see in my example below, I have child elements with the same name/key and there can be an arbitrary number of these for each store element. I intend to store these objects within the app for future use (they will be annotations on a map). So, each duplicate field needs to be stored, one of them will not suffice. I know how to model it in Core Data I believe, I'll have a phone-number entity and a store entity and will just relate the two based on <store-id>. I'm just trying to use a simple method to move them from XML to Core Data via some other data structure. XML sample: <stores>
  <store>
   <store-id>1</store-id>
   <city>Dublin</city>
   <phone>011234567</phone>
   <phone>011234566</phone>

   <phone>019876542</phone>
   <owner>Joe Bloggs</owner>
  </store>
<stores>
 If key-value pairs are the way to go, please point me to a method where I can account for the duplicate elements. If there's another way, I'm all ears. Thanks

@TITLE:Pause flash game using javascript
@CONTENT:I'm working on a flash gaming site, BeardedGames.com. I just recently implemented a "Panic" button that makes the entire site display: none and display: block's a iframe with a allowed in school website of the user's choice. It works well so far, but the user's flash game still runs in the background while hidden. Is there a way to pause (not reset) the game, that will work on most, if not all, flash games? It needs to be accessible from javascript (possibly just javascript, or a flash wrapper?), and it has to work in IE 6 and greater (I know... I know. Can't help it.). EDIT: Failed to make it clear that the user must be able to "un-pause" their game after the unpanic button is pressed. EDIT: I haven't made these games, these are already made games like linerider.

@TITLE:Request-Aware Code in Google App Engine ¡X os.environ?
@CONTENT:In GAE, you can say users.get_current_user() to get the currently logged-in user implicit to the current request. This works even if multiple requests are being processed simultaneously -- the users module is somehow aware of which request the get_current_user function is being called on behalf of. I took a look into the code of the module in the development server, and it seems to be using os.environ to get the user email and other values associated to the current request. Does this mean that every request gets an independent os.environ object? I need to implement a service similar to users.get_current_user() that would return different values depending on the request being handled by the calling code. Assuming os.environ is the way to go, how do I know which variable names are already being used (or reserved) by GAE? Also, is there a way to add a hook (or event handler) that gets called before every request?

@TITLE:iPhone dynamic UIButton in UITableView
@CONTENT:I'm creating a button for each cell row in a UITableView. The button acts as switch to add the selected row as 'favorite' in NSUserDefaults. My problem is that whenever I press this button, a new one get drawn on top of the old one. How do I release/reuse it right? This is what my cellForRowAtIndexPath method looks like: - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"cellID";

    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
    if (cell == nil) {
        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];
        cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;

    } 

    UIImage *favOn = [UIImage imageNamed:@"favOn.png"];
    UIImage *favOff = [UIImage imageNamed:@"favOff.png"];                   
    UIButton *favButton = [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(230, 0, 54, 54)];


    favButton.tag = viewTag;

    [favButton setImage:favOff forState:UIControlStateNormal];
    [favButton setImage:favOn forState:UIControlStateSelected];

    if([self getFavState:viewTag]) {

        [favButton setSelected:YES];
    }
    else {
        [favButton setSelected:NO];
    }

    [favButton addTarget:self action:@selector(favButtonSwitch:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    [favButton setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]];
    [cell.contentView addSubview:favButton];
    [favButton release];

    return cell;
}
 Further I use three different methods for selections of the buttons: - (void) setFavState:(BOOL)state withId:(NSString *)uid {

    NSUserDefaults *savedData = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
    [savedData setBool:state forKey:uid];   
}

- (BOOL) getFavState:(NSString *)uid {

    NSUserDefaults *savedData = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
    return [savedData boolForKey:uid];
}

- (void) favButtonSwitch:(id) sender {
    NSInteger senderId = [sender tag];
    NSString *senderString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%i", senderId];

    NSLog(@"sender:%i",senderId);

    [self getFavState:senderString];

    if([self getFavState:senderString]) {

        [self setFavState:NO withId:senderString];
    }
    else {
        [self setFavState:YES withId:senderString];
    }

    [self.tableView reloadData];
}

I changed it from 0 to topPadding and changed topPadding to topPadding*2 to get the right top offset. Unfortunately this has the side effect of the object making the page a little longer and allowing the user to scroll infinitely. This bug is also actually in the original code without my larger toppadding changes if you make the window small enough.

@CONTENT:I'm successfully playing sounds in a Java (1.5) applet game using the following code: // get an available clip to play it
Clip clip = null;
for (Clip clipTemp : players) {
    if (!clipTemp.isOpen()) {
    clip = clipTemp;
        break;
    }
}
if (clip == null) {
    // no available player found, don't play
    return;
}

clip.open(audioFormat, audioByteData, 0, audioByteData.length);

clip.start();
 (Players are a list of clips that I open at the start with the aim to reduce latency, a line listener closes the line when the stop event is retrieved.) The problem I'm facing is intermittent delays of upto 1 second when playing a sound. This is pretty poor. Is there any way to improve this? Are SourceDataLines worth considering?

 The above code can be tried out here The problem is that on Linux/Windows platform (on both firefox 3.5/3.6) everything works fine, and I see something like this: On Mac OS, instead, I can see the same thing but WITHOUT the button! Trying out the XUL script here, if you are using Linux/Windows the result is the same as the screenshot, but if you are on Mac there are two small buttons without text (that would be fine, but using the same xul code within the extension, no buttons are shown). Any suggestions? Is this a Mac OS firefox known issue?

@TITLE:How to set HICON on a window (.ICO with multiple sizes)?
@CONTENT:I would like to define the application icon of a Win32 window, e.g. through a call to SetClassLong with GCL_HICON and passing in a handle to an icon (see SetClassLong Function on MSDN). This works great, but I have not figured out how I should load an icon (from an ICO file) in order to keep all available sizes (e.g. 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 and full size PNG icon). When I load the icon file through LoadImage into memory to get the HICON, I have to specify which size I want (see my reply to a related question). My ICO file contains a small sized image which should be used as the window icon (top left corner of the title bar) and has been designed to be very crisp, but also larger variants which should show up in the Alt-Tab dialog, but... Loading the 16x16 icon shows the proper icon in the title bar, but - of course - an ugly stretched version of it when I Alt-Tab. And the one showing up in the task bar is not very pretty either. Loading the 48x48 icon shows a nice icon when I Alt-Tab, but the icon which shows up in the title bar is blurry, since it is a scaled down version of the 48x48 icon. Is there any means of telling Windows that my Windows has a multi-sized icon? Is there some obvious API which I have missed?

@CONTENT:I would like to write a regular expression in javascript to match specific text, only when it is not part of an html link, i.e. match <a href="/link/page1">match text</a>
 would not be matched, but match text
 or <p>match text</p>
 would be matched. (The "match text" will change each time the search is run - I will use something like var tmpStr = new RegExp("\bmatch text\b","g");
 where the value of "match text" is read from a database.) So far my best effort at a regular expression is \bmatch text\b(?!</a>)
 This deals with the closing , but not the initial . This will probably work fine for my purposes, but it does not seem ideal. I'd appreciate any help with refining the regular expression.

@TITLE:Customize JAXB 2.0 generated method names from a xsd:choice element
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how to customize a method name that's being generated by JAXB 2.1.12. I have an epic XML schema (that is not in my control), and it contains a group with a choice element that contains about 200 other elements. So when I'm generating the JAXB classes, the get() method that is created is rather unhelpful - it ends up being something like "getElement1AndElement2AndElement3()". I'd like to rename the get() method to be something better, but I can't figure out exactly how to do that. I know in the tutorial it describes customizing class names by using on an element. I found a really old article (http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/12/10/jaxb.html?page=2) that describes attaching a "name" attribute to a element, which seems to be what I need to do. Unfortunately, I think that article refers to a 1.x JAXB version, and the name attribute is no longer valid in a choice element as of JAXB 2.0. So does anybody know how I can customize the method name that gets generated? Please let me know if examples or any other information would be helpful, or if what I'm trying to do just isn't possible. Thanks!

@TITLE:How does SourceForge's download page work?
@CONTENT:In answers to other questions it was pointed out that SourceForge's download page worked by adding a hidden <iframe>. This does no longer seem to be the case... How is the current version of the download page implemented? I'd like to build something similar because I consider SF's solution quite elegant. Ok, more precisely...True, the initial "question" was too vague. If you go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/beankeeper/files/beankeeper/2.6.2/beankeeper-2.6.2.tar.gz/download there's a plain old HTML link to download the file in question but there's also an automatic download. The delay seems to be some 2s. Someone asked for my particular use case. I'll answer that knowing that it might divert from the OP to a certain extent. Very much simplified: more or less traditional Java EE app with two Servlets a dispatcher Servlet which acts as an entry point for the UI controller a "document Servlet" which streams PDF to the browser, it does so with content-disposition=attachment i.e. browser shows save-or-open dialog a print out page with a number of input fields and a submit button when the submit button is clicked the input field values should be updated in the UI model (and session where necessary) -> that's what the dispatcher Servlet does the creation of the PDF must be triggered -> that's what the document Servlet does If I adopted SF's model a form submit would trigger the dispatcher Servlet and reload the current page (regular behavior). Upon reload of the page I would somehow - right, how does SF do that? - cause the browser to invoke the document Servlet.

@CONTENT:UpDate: Yes, that was it! Like mloskot said, the whole tabel needs to be dumped. selecting fields with sql loses information about fuield widths. Thanks, that fixed it! Hi All, I have a problem with ogr2ogr. I'm trying to dump a PostgreSQL tabel to a Shapefile. ogr2ogr seems to change the size of data-types like integer and char. Here's part of the DB structure that the Shapefile set was read into: Table "test"
nd_1 - numeric(8,0)
nd_2 - numeric(2,0)
nd_3 - numeric(2,0)
nd_9 - character varying(60)
 and it looks correctly. Here's where the fun begins: ogr2ogr air5000.shp "PG: [...]" sql 'select
CAST(nd_1 AS INTEGER),
CAST(nd_2 AS INTEGER),
CAST(nd_3 as INTEGER),
CAST(ND_9 AS CHARACTER VARYING(60))
from test' ;
 then dbview -e test.dbf 

Field Name Type Length Decimal Pos
nd 1 - N - 11 - 0
nd 2 - N - 11 - 0
nd 3 - N - 11 - 0
nd 9 - C - 80 - 0
 num-length goes form 8,2,2 to 11, char length goes from 10 to 80. I read that these are the defaults if width (length) is not specified. How can i specify the width? I tried every combo with or without casting, like this: select
CAST(nd_1 AS NUMERIC),
CAST(nd_2 AS NUMERIC),
CAST(nd_3 as NUMERIC),
CAST(ND_9 AS CHARACTER VARYING(60))
 which gives in dbview: Field Name Type Length Decimal Pos
nd 1 - N - 24 - 15
nd 2 - N - 24 - 15
nd 3 - N - 24 - 15
nd 9 - C - 80 - 0
 no casting (select * from test) gives Field Name      Type    Length  Decimal Pos
nd 1 - N - 24 - 15
nd 2 - N - 24 - 15
nd 3 - N - 24 - 15
nd 9 - C - 80 - 0
 Nowhere near the originals on any occasion. debugfile [--debug on] gives nothing special IMHO, here is the output of the 3 ogr2ogr command i tried: PG: PQexec(DECLARE executeSQLCursor CURSOR for select CAST(nd_1 AS INTEGER), CAST(nd_2 AS INTEGER), CAST(nd_3 as INTEGER), CAST(ND_9 AS CHARACTER VARYING(60)) from test)

@TITLE:Confused about JavaScript prototypal inheritance
@CONTENT:In the book "JavaScript the definitive guide 5 edition", section 9.2 Prototypes and Inheritance, I find the following words: In the previous section, I showed that the new operator creates a new, empty object and then invokes a constructor function as a method of that object. This is not the complete story, however. After creating the empty object, new sets the prototype of that object. The prototype of an object is the value of the prototype property of its constructor function. All functions have a prototype property that is automatically created and initialized when the function is defined. The initial value of the prototype property is an object with a single property. This property is named constructor and refers back to the constructor function with which the prototype is associated. (You may recall the constructor property from Chapter 7 ; this is why every object has a constructor property.) Any properties you add to this prototype object will appear to be properties of objects initialized by the constructor. Now, if that is true, how could prototypal inheritance exists? I mean, let's say the prototype object of a constructor function has a constructor property initially. Because the prototype object itself is an object, to determine its constructor we often use prototype_object.constructor. But now the prototype_object already has a constructor property itself, and it points to the constructor function with which the prototype is associated. In this situation how can inheritance exists?

@TITLE:g++ compilation error of another thing that works in msvs
@CONTENT:Heya, folks. I'm porting some code from a project largely developed in MSVS to use g++. I've found a lot of little differences, mostly things that MSVS allows but g++ does not. Usually it's something involving c++ standards, things that MSVS lets slide, but I'm having trouble seeing just what's wrong with one particular section. g++ is having trouble matching a call to operator !=, but only in a specific context. Looking up operator != for a particular nested class works if the hosting class is not a template. If I turn the hosting class into a class template, however, everything breaks. I'm either missing something fundamental to c++, or g++ is doing something wrong. I've learned not to cry "Compiler Bug!" too often, so I wanted to see if anyone here can see what I'm missing. This worked example shows the working, non-template version, and then the broken, template version. g++ --version gives: g++ (Ubuntu 4.4.1-4ubuntu9) 4.4.1 Working reference version without templates namespace Works {

struct host {
    struct iterator {};
    iterator op();
};

bool operator != (host::iterator const& a0, host::iterator const& a1);

bool f() {
    return host().op() != host().op();
}

} // namespace Works
 Broken version with templates namespace Broken {

template <typename T>

                   typename host<T>::iterator const& a1);

bool f() {
    return host<int>().op() != host<int>().op();
}

} // namespace Broken
 The template version fails with the errors: Main.cpp: In function ¡¥bool Broken::f()¡¦:

@CONTENT:OK, I don't know how to word this question, but maybe my code will spell out the problem: public class ControllerTest
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        GamePadController rockbandDrum = new GamePadController();
        DrumMachine drum = new DrumMachine();

        while(true)
        {
            try{

            rockbandDrum.poll();

            if(rockbandDrum.isButtonPressed(1)) //BLUE PAD HhiHat)
            {
                drum.playSound("hiHat.wav");
                Thread.sleep(50);
            }

            if(rockbandDrum.isButtonPressed(2)) //GREEN PAD (Crash)
            {
                //Todo: Change to Crash
                drum.playSound("hiHat.wav");
                Thread.sleep(50);
            }
            //Etc....
         }
     }
}

public class DrumMachine
{
    InputStream soundPlayer = null;
    AudioStream audio = null;
    static boolean running = true;

    public void playSound(String soundFile)
    {
        //Tak a sound file as a paramater and then
        //play that sound file
        try{
            soundPlayer = new FileInputStream(soundFile);
            audio = new AudioStream(soundPlayer);

        }
        catch(FileNotFoundException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        catch(IOException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        AudioPlayer.player.start(audio);
    }
    //Etc... Methods for multiple audio clip playing
}
 Now the problem is, if I lower the delay in the Thread.sleep(50)
 then the sound plays multiple times a second, but if I keep at this level or any higher, I could miss sounds being played... It's an odd problem, where if the delay is too low, the sound loops. But if it's too high it misses playing sounds. Is this just a problem where I would need to tweak the settings, or is there any other way to poll the controller without looping sound? Edit: If I need to post the code for polling the controller I will... import java.io.*;

@LINK:/questions/2169487/connecting-multiple-signals-to-a-single-slot-in-qt
@TITLE:Connecting multiple signals to a single slot in Qt
@CONTENT:I'm trying to keep track of the textChanged() signal on for handful of QTextEdits. I want to do the same thing regardless of the text edit emitting the signal: uncheck its associated checkbox in a QListWidget if it becomes empty and leave it checked otherwise. The function I have so for is as follows: void MainWindow::changed()
{
    QString tempStr = ui->hNMRedit->toPlainText();
    if(tempStr != "")
    {
       ui->checkList->item(0)->setCheckState(Qt::Checked);
    }
    else
    {
       ui->checkList->item(0)->setCheckState(Qt::Unchecked);
    }
}
 With the current approach, I would have to make a function like this for every QTextEdit; each function containing virtually identical code. If I stored each of the text edits in an array (so I could find their associated index in the QListWidget), would it be possible for me to have a slot like this? void MainWindow::changed(QWidget *sender)   // for whichever text edit emits the
                                            // textChanged() signal
{
    QString tempStr = sender->toPlainText();
    if(tempStr != "")
    {
       // I would potentially use some sort of indexOf(sender) function on the array I 
       // mentioned earlier here... a little new to Qt, sorry
       ui->checkList->item(array.indexOf(sender))->setCheckState(Qt::Checked);
    }
    else
    {
       // same as above...
       ui->checkList->item(array.indexOf(sender))->setCheckState(Qt::Unchecked);
    }
}
 Is this possible or should I just create a separate slot for every text edit? Please let me know if any further clarification is needed! Lastly, I feel like the only meaningful difference between QLineEdits and QTextEdits is the default size. In favor of keeping things consistent, should I just use one of these objects throughout my UI? Thanks!!!
@CODE:void MainWindow::changed()
{
    QString tempStr = ui->hNMRedit->toPlainText();
    if(tempStr != "")
    {
       ui->checkList->item(0)->setCheckState(Qt::Checked);
    }
    else
    {
       ui->checkList->item(0)->setCheckState(Qt::Unchecked);
    }
} void MainWindow::changed(QWidget *sender)   // for whichever text edit emits the
                                            // textChanged() signal
{
    QString tempStr = sender->toPlainText();
    if(tempStr != "")
    {
       // I would potentially use some sort of indexOf(sender) function on the array I 
       // mentioned earlier here... a little new to Qt, sorry
       ui->checkList->item(array.indexOf(sender))->setCheckState(Qt::Checked);
    }

    {
       // same as above...
       ui->checkList->item(array.indexOf(sender))->setCheckState(Qt::Unchecked);

@TITLE:BizTalk - Receive Port reading twice from DB
@CONTENT:My receive port is of sqlBinding and typed polling. It invokes a SP to fetch a record and based on filter condition the corresponding orchestration kicks off. The BizTalk group consists of 2 servers; thus 2 ReceiveHostInstances. If both the host instances are running -at some point the same request is being read twice - causing a duplicate at the receivers end. But, why is the reeive port reading it the same record more than once? The proc which reads the updates the record and updates it so that it wont be fecthed again. I observed this scenario while submitting 10 requests; receive port read 11 times and 11 orchestrations started. I tried the same (10 request) with one host (as in my Dev), the receive is showing 10 only. Any clues?

@LINK:/questions/2163715/drawing-an-overlay-in-custom-flex-component
@TITLE:Drawing an overlay in custom flex component
@CONTENT:How would one create a custom MXML component in flex which is based on an existing component but draws an overlay over this existing component in certain situations. Ideally, the new component should be based on (derive from) the exiting component so that occurrences of the existing component could just be swapped out with the new one. I tried to override updateDisplayList() in the new component and to paint the overlay using this.graphics. This resulted in the overlay being drawn underneath the children of the existing component. I also tried to do the drawing upon receiving a render-event which lead to similar results. When the external condition which should trigger the display of the overlay changes, I call invalidateDisplayList() on my new component. That works to trigger the drawing for both cases described above. The remaining problem seems to be to figure out how to draw on top of all the other components once they are added. The following example should illustrate what I tried to do; when overlayEnabled was set and the component's invalidateDisplayList() method was called, the red rectangle would get painted in the background.... // NewComponent.mxml
<ExistingComponent ...>
    <mx:Script>
    ...

        public var overlayEnabled:Boolean;

        override protected updateDisplayList(...) {
            super.updateDisplayList(...)

@LINK:/questions/2157651/help-turning-jquery-script-into-a-plugin
@TITLE:Help turning jQuery script into a plugin
@CONTENT:Easy All As I've been learning jQuery lately, I decided to write my own modal window to play videos in, when the video thumbnail is clicked. It all works fine, but I'm just wondering how could I turn it into a plugin, so I could use it on different pages with different parameters etc. I read the documentation, and a few tutorials, but I can't seem to get it working. My basic code is as follows: <script type="text/javascript">
var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
$j(document).ready(function(){

    // Add our click OPEN event
    $j("a.video_link").click(function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        // Add our overlay div
        $j('body').append('<div id="overlay" />');
        // Fade in overlay
        $j('#overlay').css({"display":"block","opacity":"0"}).animate({"opacity":"0.2"}, 300),
        // Animate our modal window into view
        $j('#video').css({"top":"43%"}).css({"opacity":"0"}).show().animate({"top": "50%", "opacity": "1"}, 550),
        // Add our close image
        $j('#video').append('<div id="modal-vid-close" title="Close window" />');
        // Add our click CLOSE event
        $j('#overlay, #modal-vid-close').click(function () {
            //Animate our modal window out of view
            $j('#video').animate({"top": "55%", "opacity": "0"}, 350).fadeOut(200),
            // Fade out and remove our overlay
            $j('#overlay').fadeOut(200, function () { $j(this).remove(); $j('#modal-vid-close').remove()} )
        });
    });
});
 I'd like to turn this into a plugin so I can use it on different pages, and just specify the 'trigger' link, and the div id to show in the window (it will already be loaded on the page, but hidden). Something like this, added to doc load on each page: var trigger = $j('.video_container a');
var modalcontent = $j('#video');
 Any help, or pointers to good tutorials, much appreciated!
@CODE:<script type="text/javascript">
var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
$j(document).ready(function(){

    // Add our click OPEN event
    $j("a.video_link").click(function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        // Add our overlay div
        $j('body').append('<div id="overlay" />');
        // Fade in overlay
        $j('#overlay').css({"display":"block","opacity":"0"}).animate({"opacity":"0.2"}, 300),
        // Animate our modal window into view
        $j('#video').css({"top":"43%"}).css({"opacity":"0"}).show().animate({"top": "50%", "opacity": "1"}, 550),
        // Add our close image
        $j('#video').append('<div id="modal-vid-close" title="Close window" />');
        // Add our click CLOSE event
        $j('#overlay, #modal-vid-close').click(function () {
            //Animate our modal window out of view
            $j('#video').animate({"top": "55%", "opacity": "0"}, 350).fadeOut(200),
            // Fade out and remove our overlay
            $j('#overlay').fadeOut(200, function () { $j(this).remove(); $j('#modal-vid-close').remove()} )
        });
    });
}); var trigger = $j('.video_container a');

 I don't like grovelling. I can't bear long posts either, but I'm working in an environment where I've nobody who knows about these technologies and stack overflow is the only and best place I've found to ask these questions. As I'm at my wits end, I hope you don't mind the extra post length. My question then is what from the above code needs to change to get the TaskListData String[] member FTQar accessible? At this stage, I'll be honest and say I'm hoping someone could post a modified snippet of my code showing me where I've gone wrong. If it were up to me, you'd get extra points than normal for the right answer. Many thanks indeed Mark

@TITLE:Web Analytics for Platform with Custom Events
@CONTENT:I'm building a platform that produces websites. Think wordpress.com as a similar example. Each site is going to be a subdomain of my domain like abc.mydomain.com or xyz.mydomain.com. I have a few requirements for analytics of which I haven't been able to meet all of: I would like to be able to see both stats for individual sites and aggregate stats for all sites. I would like to track custom events, like how many contributions users have made. I would like support for any number of subdomains. I would like to be able to give my customers limited access to see the data only their site. I would like to be able to set this all up in an automated way, ideally via an API, when a new site is created. I know with Google Analytics you can create filters and profiles, which might solve 3) and/or 4) but I don't think this is exposed via the API AND I believe there is a limit on profiles of 50. Also if I can't satisfy 4) I probably can't use Google Analytics at all as my clients would likely want to use it, and I don't think you can run two GA trackers at the same time. That said, I would happily sacrifice 4) if the others were met as clients could still use their own GA account. Of course I can just build a cron script to parse the various DBs and log files, but I'm hoping not to reinvent the wheel. Plus I would miss out on all the nice graphs and extras that most services have. Any platform developers have any insight here? Thanks.

@TITLE:C++ Sieve of Atkin overlooks a few prime numbers
@CONTENT:Recently I've been working on a C++ prime generator that uses the Sieve of Atkin ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_atkin ) to generate its primes. My objective is to be able to generate any 32-bit number. I'll use it mostly for project euler problems. mostly it's just a summer project. The program uses a bitboard to store primality: that is, a series of ones and zeros where for example the 11th bit would be a 1, the 12th a 0, and the 13th a 1, etc. For efficient memory usage, this is actually and array of chars, each char containing 8 bits. I use flags and bitwise-operators to set and retrieve bits. The gyst of the algorithm is simple: do a first pass using some equations I don't pretend to understand to define if a number is considered "prime" or not. This will for the most part get the correct answers, but a couple nonprime numbers will be marked as prime. Therefore, when iterating through the list, you set all multiples of the prime you just found to "not prime". This has the handy advantage of requiring less processor time the larger a prime gets. I've got it 90% complete, with one catch: some of the primes are missing. Through inspecting the bitboard, I have ascertained that these primes are omitted during the first pass, which basically toggles a number for every solution it has for a number of equations (see wikipedia entry). I've gone over this chunk of code time and time again. I even tried increasing the bounds to what is shown in the wikipedia articles, which is less efficient but I figured might hit a few numbers that I have somehow omitted. Nothing has worked. These numbers simply evaluate to not prime. Most of my test has been on all primes under 128. Of this range, these are the primes that are omitted: 23 and 59. I have no doubt that on a higher range, more would be missing (just don't want to count through all of them). I don't know why these are missing, but they are. Is there anything special about these two primes? I've double and triple checked, finding and fixing mistakes, but it is still probably something stupid that I am missing. anyways, here is my code: #include <iostream>

@CONTENT:I have an XSD file and I want to create an XML file at runtime based on the XSD. (My question is basically the same as this one, except in the .NET world, rather than for Java.) I have run xsd.exe /c /l:vb MyTest.xsd, but that generates a class that cannot be instantiated and used, as it has nested classes that are never instantiated. It appears that the generated class is only used for XML deserialization, but I don't have an XML file to deserialize from. Running xsd.exe /d /l:vb MyTest.xsd generates a dataset, but it looks like using that would be more coding than just writing out an XmlDocument manually. What is the best way to create an XML file based on a specific schema?

@TITLE:Objective-C va_list and selectors
@CONTENT:Is it possible to use @selector and performSelector: (or similar) with methods using variable arguments list? I'm writing a class that can be assigned a delegate to override the default behavior. In the presence of a delegate select method calls made on an instance of that class will be forward to the same corresponding delegate method, some which use variable argument lists. So, for instance, I need to be able to create retrieve SEL reference and message the delegate object with a method such as this: - (void)logEventWithFormat:(NSString *)format, ... {
    va_list argList;
    id del = self.delegate;
    if (del != nil && 
        [del conformsToProtocol:@protocol(AProtocolWithOptionalMethods)] &&
        [del respondsToSelector:@selector(logEventWithFormat:)])
    {
        // Perform selector on object 'del' with 'argList'
    }
}
 I am assuming this is not possible, hence the similar method declaration in the Foundation framework - in NSString: - (id)initWithFormat:(NSString*)format, ...;
 and - (id)initWithFormat:(NSString *)format arguments:(va_list)argList;
 I assume that the protocol I wish to delegate to should suggest the implementation of: - (void)logEventWithFormat:(NSString *)format arguments:(va_list)argList;
 so I the selector @selector(logEventWithFormat:arguments:) can be used an called with: [del performSelector:@selector(logEventWithFormat:arguments:) 
          withObject:format
          withObject:argList];
 I just wondered if I was missing something or going the long way around to achieve what I'm trying to?

@TITLE:db4o, Linq, and UUID's
@CONTENT:Apparently the db4o website was recently redone, and now old urls are giving 404 errors. Everytime I think I've found the answer, I get a 404 error. I have a simple db4o database I've setup to store people. public class Person
{
     public string Firstname { get; set;}
     public string Lastname {get;set;}
}
 I've been able to run Linq queries on the database, and everything works wonderfully. I'm programming in a web environment, so I will need someone to identify and fetch unique objects from the database, so I simply configured the database to use UUID's. Now the problem has become, how can I get to the UUID information from the objects I get from the Linq query? For example, let's say I get all the people stored in the database, and I need to generate the unique URL's for each person. I will use the UUID to do so. So I'll run this: var people = (from Person p in db select p).ToList();
 And then I'll iterate through the list foreach( Person person in people)
{
  DoSomething(person);
}
 The best solution would be making the UUID a property on the Person class, so that I could just: var uuid = person.UUID;
 I don't see a mechanism for doing that however. Am I missing something?
@CODE:public class Person
{
     public string Firstname { get; set;}
     public string Lastname {get;set;}
} var people = (from Person p in db select p).ToList(); foreach( Person person in people)

@CONTENT:This is a very simple question but what does the following function prototype mean? int square( int y, size_t* x ) what dose the size_t* mean? I know size_t is a data type (int >=0). But how do I read the * attached to it? Is it a pointer to the memory location for x? In general I'm having trouble with this stuff, and if anybody could provide a handy reference, I'd appreciate it. Thanks everybody. I understand what a pointer is, but I guess I have a hard hard time understanding the relationship between pointers and functions. When I see a function prototype defined as int sq(int x, int y), then it is perfectly clear to me what is going on. However, when I see something like int sq( int x, int* y), then I cannot--for the life of me--understand what the second parameter really means. On some level I understand it means "passing a pointer" but I don't understand things well enough to manipulate it on my own.

 I probably did a fundamental mistake, but I can find it right now, synthesizing with boolArray[100] didn't work either.

@TITLE:Logic for Implementing a Dynamic Web Scraper in C#
@CONTENT:I am looking to develop a Web scraper in C# window forms. What I am trying to accomplish is as follows: Get the URL from the user. Load the Web page in the IE UI control(embedded browser) in WINForms. Allow the User to select a text (contiguous , small(not exceeding 50 chars)). from the loaded web page. When the User wishes to persist the location (the HTML DOM location) it has to be persisted into the DB, so that the user may use that location to fetch the data in that location during his subsequent visits. Assume that the loaded website is a pricelisting site and the quoted rate keeps on changing, the idea is to persist the DOM hierarchy so that I can traverse it next time. I would be able to do this if all the HTML elements had their id attributes. In the case where the id is null , i am not able to accomplish this . Could someone suggest a valid idea on this (a bare minimum code snippet if possible).? It would be helpful , even if you can share some online resources. thanks, vijay

@TITLE:Method signature for a Selector
@CONTENT:I'm new to the Objective C business (Java developer most of the time) and am woking on my first killer app now. :-) At the moment I am somehow confused about the usage of selectors as method arguments. They seem to be a little bit different than delegates in C# for example. Given the following method signature -(void)execute:(SEL)callback;
 is there a way to enforce the signature for the selector passed to such a method? The method is expecting a selector of a method with the following signature -(void)foo:(NSData*)data;
 But the SEL (type) is generic, so there is a good chance to pass a wrong selector to the execute method. OK at least at runtime one would see a funny behavior... but I would like to see a compiler warning/error when this happens.

@TITLE:Any way to run Firefox with GreaseMonkey scripts without a GUI/X session
@CONTENT:I need to build a small "monitoring" scraper for a 3rd party website (it's an external website that has stats about our visitors). Unfortunately, this website is very hard to scrape through the normal "wget" mechanism, because it uses a ton of sophisticated JS, part of it generated by GWT. So my workaround was to create a GreaseMonkey script and then have this script call a PHP page that would log the scraped data. Then as soon as Firefox starts with this webpage-to-scrape, the script goes to work. This works well, but now I am trying to make it more robust as far as monitoring tools go. I want it to run on the server using a cron job. As far as I understand such things, this requires a DISPLAY variable to be set and for an X session to exist (Firefox is refusing to run for me). Is there any nice way to allow it to run from the batchuser account as a cron job?

@CONTENT:We're trying to measure performance of our system, which is a .NET 3.5 application that uses WCF calls. Problem is until now, we weren't able to profile the methods inside these calls. A winforms client application was coded to test our system. We tried using ANTS 4 Profiler and VS2008 built-in Performance Analyzer, but we only got the total time of the WCF call. We would like to be able to measure all the calls that are being made inside of the WCF call. Does anybody know if that's possible? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Android 2.1 bug: uses res/layout-v3 instead of res/layout
@CONTENT:In addition to the general res/layout folder I have a res/layout-v3 folder for backward compatibility with Android 1.5, which has problems with some RelativeLayout layouts. It works perfectly with all phones and emulator versions tested so far. Except of 2.1 (emulator and Nexus One). They choose to display the Android 1.5 layout (res/layout-v3) instead of the default res/ layout. Can anyone else confirm that? Is this an Android OS bug? If so, where is the best place to submit the bug report? Thanks UPDATE: After reading up on http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/guide/practices/screens_support.html#qualifiers again (thanks Mark for the hint), especially this part Resources that are for use only on a specific API Level or higher. For example, if your application is designed to run on both Android 1.5 (API Level 3) and Android 1.6 (API Level 4 and higher), you can use the -v4 qualifier to tag any resources that should be excluded when your application is running on Android 1.5 (API Level 3). I changed my layout order from having res/layout-v3 (for Android 1.5 only -> this was a wrong assumption I made) res/layout (for anything else) to my new configuration of having: res/layout-v4 (for Android 1.6 and higher) res/layout (for anything else -> in this case this would be Android 1.5 only) If I understand the above documentation right and if my assumptions in the parentheses are correct this time it should work now. However, the result is the following: Android 1.5 is using res/layout -> OK Android 1.6 is using res/layout-v4 -> OK Android 2.0 is using res/layout -> NOT OK Android 2.1 is using res/layout-v4 -> OK So why is Android 2.0 (on both Emulator and Motorola Milestone) not picking the right layout resource folder? I tested it then again with 2.0.1 and it seems to work there. So that seems to be a bug in 2.0 which got fixed in 2.0.1 But now the weirdest thing: in order to make it somehow run on 2.0 I copied the res/layout-v4 folder to res/layout-v5 to force Android 2.0 using this layout resource. Didn't work. But then I tried copying it to res/layout-v6 (which is supposed to be Android 2.0.1) and voil? all the sudden it works with 2.0. Very strange! But I hope this workaround will help a few other people out there.

@TITLE:How to POST Data to another web application (cross domain)
@CONTENT:Please consider the following scenario, There are two web applications App1 & App2. A user would submit his information on App1 though a form. On click of a specific button/link on App1, the same data should be posted to a page on App2 and the user should also be redirected to the same page on App2. I would like some help in finding out the best way to implement this functionality. One of the approaches that I have already tried out is by creating a temporary HTML form at runtime, setting the action attribute of the form to the App2 Page and get the form posted by using javascript submit. The data can then be fetched on App2 page by using the response.form object. This approach works well, but i was still wondering if there is any other way to implement the required functionality. I would really appriciate if you can give some insights on using RESTful webservices to implement this, or else, using some HttpModule to intercept requests at App1 and modify redirect response to app2 or any other approach that you might find fit for the purpose. Edit: Using querystring isnt an option for me.

@TITLE:Help with PHP call_user_func and integrate function into Class?
@CONTENT:Below is a function I found about a year ago that is supposed to put a lock on a memcache key so you can update it's value without any trouble of 2 request trying to update the key at the same time. It is pretty basic but I could use a little help in figuring out how to use it 100%. The part I am not sure about is where it passes in a $updateFunction which is then passed to ** call_user_func($updateFunction, $data); // update data
 I have never used the call_user_func() before. Based on this code could some one show me a basic example of what a function that it calls could look like (without doing any mysql or anything, just the way it would work). Would I be able to pass in multiple properties to the call function? Thanks for any help. Also assuming I already have a Class name Memcache which has a connection or object with this $this->connection would I need to change anything in the function below to add it into my Memcache class? Also once this function is part of my existing memcache class, will that callback function be able to call methods in other classes? Hope this isn't to confusing. // {{{ locked_mecache_update($memcache,$key,$updateFunction,$expiryTime,$waitUTime,$maxTries)

@TITLE:Windows: How do I calculate the time it takes a c/c++ application to run?
@CONTENT:I am doing a performance comparison test. I want to record the run time for my c++ test application and compare it under different circumstances. The two cases to be compare are: 1) a file system driver is installed and active and 2) also when that same file system driver is not installed and active. A series of tests will be conducted on several operating systems and the two runs described above will be done for each operating system and it's setup. Results will only be compared between the two cases for a given operating system and setup. I understand that when running a c/c++ application within an operating system that is not a real-time system there is no way to get the real time it took for the application to run. I don't think this is a big concern as long as the test application runs for a fairly long period of time, therefore making the scheduling, priorities, switching, etc of the CPU negligible. Edited: For Windows platform only How can I generate some accurate application run time results within my test application?

@CONTENT:I am thinking of developing a simple Android application that lets users compose music on Android phones. I am new to the Android platform. I have some coding experience in Java that involves being aware of basic OOPS and Java concepts and developing some small Java applications(less than 1k lines of code). I have set up Android on my Linux system and have been able to run a "hello World" application. I want to develop a simple Android app in a month wherein users can compose music. What I want to do is this- A touch on the screen should produce/emit a sound/tone. Touching different parts of the screen should produce/emit sounds of different pitch levels/frequencies. Once this is done I want to improve the UI and add some basic features of playback, "clearing" currently selected tones on the screen. How do I start doing this? Also, given my limited experience with java, how should I divide the tasks so that I can finish this in a month?

 Does that look right? The second part is to return the number of any bits of any data type with a macro, and the macro can be taken from limits.h. I looked up limits.h on my machine, and also http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/limits.h.html, but I don't think I really understand how any of those would return the number of bits in any data type.

@TITLE:System.Diaganostics.Process - (When one process internally uses another)
@CONTENT:This is a bit involved, but please help. I'm starting to fall way behind due to this problem. God bless you for your attention to this. I've been using C# System.Diagnostics.Process to monitor the output of a command line utility. The process I'm monitoring "internally" launches a second process, and as soon as it does, I receive no further output from the process object. What's frustrating, is, if you execute the very same command (that I'm launching with the System.Diagnostics.Process object) with cmd.exe (manually), the console outputs every line I need to be seeing in my c# app! However, if I (for testing purposes) launch cmd.exe with the System.Diagnostics.Process object, and run the command, it still stops outputting at the same point that it did previously (launching process1.exe directly); at the point the second.exe is utilised. I thought this test would consolidate all output from all processes involved, but it didn't. How can I get all this output into my C# application? Conceptually, this is my problem (I think).

I did it this way: php -r 'set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . "/var/www/.../Zend/library")';
 After var_dumping result of the function above it returned old include_path which should mean success. But next call of get_include_path() returned the old path too. I've also tried to set the environment variable: ZF_INCLUDE_PATH_PREPEND="/var/www/.../Zend/library"
 There is our company framework in the old include_path directory so I can't (even if I could I should't) copy there the ZF library. I think a proper framework shouldn't rely on any global PHP settings as include_path is. I think it should be possible to set the include path somewhere in ZF internal configuration file. edit: I added set_include_path('/var/www/.../Zend/library') into zf.php file and the tool stopped throwing 'wrong include_path' error. In fact it sopped printing any output. When executing command zf create project test it does nothing. ~/.zf folder wasn't created.

WMI indicates that this information can be found in the IPAddress Property of Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration but can be both IPv6 or IPv4. This does not give me a "yes/no" answer I am hoping to find. Other caveats are that I would prefer not to scrape the details by accessing the registry directly, nor scrape from the output of a command such as ipconfig. Given our environment has a mix of 2003/2008 machines, can anyone think of a way to test for IPv6? Cheers

Now my boss wants me to partition this data into separate tables in our database (With a One to One Relationship), as so: He makes it sound "obvious" that it should be this way, but is there really any advantages to having this data separated as so for inserting and updating (For instance if I put an index on Color or Make)?

@CONTENT:EDIT : This question doesn't really make sense once you have picked up what the "r" flag means. More details here. For people looking for a quick anwser, I added on below. If I enter a regexp manually in a Python script, I can use 4 combinations of flags for my pattern strings : p1 = "pattern" p2 = u"pattern" p3 = r"pattern" p4 = ru"pattern" I have a bunch a unicode strings coming from a Web form input and want to use them as regexp patterns. I want to know what process I should apply to the strings so I can expect similar result from the usage of the manual form above. Something like : import re
assert re.match(p1, some_text) == re.match(someProcess1(web_input), some_text)
assert re.match(p2, some_text) == re.match(someProcess2(web_input), some_text)
assert re.match(p3, some_text) == re.match(someProcess3(web_input), some_text)
assert re.match(p4, some_text) == re.match(someProcess4(web_input), some_text)
 What would be someProcess1 to someProcessN and why ? I suppose that someProcess2 doesn't need to do anything while someProcess1 should do some unicode conversion to the local encoding. For the raw string literals, I am clueless.
@CODE:import re
assert re.match(p1, some_text) == re.match(someProcess1(web_input), some_text)
assert re.match(p2, some_text) == re.match(someProcess2(web_input), some_text)

I then implemented getOMClass() in each of those peers. The problem is that when I do queries using the 4 peers, they return all 4 types of objects. That is, ReviewPeer will return Visits, Ratings, Comments, AND Reviews. Example: $c = new Criteria();
$c->add(RatingPeer::VALUE, 5, Criteria::GREATER_THAN);
$positive_ratings = RatingPeer::doSelect($c);
 This returns all comments, ratings, reviews, & checkins that have a value > 5. ReviewPeer should only return Review objects, and can't figure out how to do this. Do I actually have to go through and change all my criteria to manually specify the classkey? That seems a little pointless, since the Peer name already distinct. I don't want to have to customize each Peer. I should be able to customize JUST the TalkPeer, since they all inherit from it... I just can't figure out how. I tried changing doSelectStmt just in TalkPeer so that it automatically adds the CLASSKEY restriction to the Criteria. It almost works, but I get a: Fatal error: Cannot instantiate abstract class Talk in /models/om/BaseTalkPeer.php on line 503. Line 503 is in BaseTalkPeer::populateObjects(), and is the 3rd line below: $cls = TalkPeer::getOMClass($row, 0); 
$cls = substr('.'.$cls, strrpos('.'.$cls, '.') + 1); 
$obj = new $cls();
 The docs talked about overriding BaseTalkPeer::populateObject(). I have a feeling that's my problem, but even after reading the source code, I still couldn't figure out how to get it to work. Here is what I tried in TalkPeer::doSelectStmt:     public static function doSelectStmt(Criteria $criteria, PropelPDO $con = null)
    {
        $keys = array('models.Visit'=>1,'models.Comment'=>2,'models.Rating'=>3,'models.Review'=>4);

        $class_name = self::getOMClass();

        if(isset($keys[$class_name]))
        {   //Talk itself is not a returnable type, so we must check
            $class_key = $keys[$class_name];
            $criteria->add(TalkPeer::CLASS_KEY, $class_key);
        }

        return parent::doSelectStmt($criteria, $con = null);
    }
 Here is an example of my getOMClass method from ReviewPeer: public static function getOMClass()
{
    return self::CLASSNAME_4; //aka 'talk.Review';
}
 Here is the relevant bit of my schema: <table name="talk" idMethod="native" abstract="true">
   <column name="talk_pk" type="INTEGER" required="true" autoIncrement="true" primaryKey="true" />
   <column name="class_key" type="INTEGER" required="true" default="" inheritance="single">
       <inheritance key="1" class="Visit" extends="models.Talk" />

       <inheritance key="3" class="Rating" extends="models.Talk" />
       <inheritance key="4" class="Review" extends="models.Rating" />
       </column>
</table>
 P.S. - No, I can't upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4. There's just too much code that would need to be re-tested
@CODE:$c = new Criteria();
$c->add(RatingPeer::VALUE, 5, Criteria::GREATER_THAN);

@CONTENT:The boost::asio package contains classes for doing asynchronous file io in Windows using IO completion ports. To my understanding, there is no support for asynchronous file io for other platforms included in the asio package. I am wondering what would need to be done in order to extend asio with asynchronous file io support for at least Mac OS X, but also to some extent Linux. I am mostly interested in what would need to be done on the asio side of things, but since I am not that experienced with Mac OS X programming I don't mind pointers on where to find more information on how to do asynchronous file io in Mac OS X as well - is PBReadForkAsync what I should be looking at? Update: I've finally gotten around to attempt to build asynchronous file io (outside boost::asio) on Mac OS X using aio_read/aio_write, however I am unable to get the callback data I need (see How to get user data for aio signal handler in Mac OS X).

@TITLE:Lock-free thread-safe queue - need advice
@CONTENT:I need to design a thread-safe logger. My logger must have a Log() method that simply queues a text to be logged. Also a logger must be lock-free - so that other thread can log messages without locking the logger. I need to design a worker thread that must wait for some synchronization event and then log all messages from the queue using standard .NET logging (that is not thread-safe). So what i am interested in is synchronization of worker thread - and Log function. Below is a sketch of the class that i designed. I think I must use Monitor.Wait/Pulse here or any other means to suspend and resume worker thread. I don;t want to spend CPU cycles when there is no job for logger. Let me put it another way - I want to design a logger that will not block a caller threads that use it. I have a high performance system - and that is a requirement. class MyLogger

 // this function is used by other threads to queue log messages

@LINK:/questions/2045263/strategy-for-unique-user-voting-such-as-stackoverflows
@TITLE:Strategy for unique user-voting such as Stackoverflow's?
@CONTENT:I noticed that for voting SO implements an XHR method which POSTs to a posts controller and sends the post ID and vote type through the URL, in addition a fkey parameter is sent, eg: http://stackoverflow.com/posts/1/vote/2
 I'm going to be implementing a similar technique, I'm wondering what logic I could use to prevent duplicate voting by the same user and prevent spamming, in addition to overall logic when implementing this. The schema for the table I'll be storing them: thread_id   user_id   vote_type
2334        1         2
 So far I came up with these bullet points: ensure the user is logged in ensure that a valid post ID and valid vote type is sent ensure that after POSTing, the user has not previously voted the code that creates the hash can't contain dynamic information such as user agent, since a user could be on a different browser, different OS, right? Update: "SO is probably using the login cookie to identify the user." - Andrew Could someone demonstrate how this would be done, or in other words more specifically provide an example of how the fkey, which is an alphanumeric 32-bit string, is generated? Question: since I'm not sending the actual user id anywhere with my XHR code, does this mean I have to update my table schema so that I can store the fkey instead of say, the user_id? The fkey will probably have to be unique to each user, and so I can probably query whether there is a row in the voting table that has an fkey of whatever. Would appreciate any tips or insight on anyone who's implemented a similar technique.

I am unsure of where to even start... For those of you who may wish to see my PHP code. I am making use of the PHP class: [link text][1] which allows me to write code like: // load the class and file
$html = new simple_html_dom();
$html->load_file("index.php");

// find the first editable area and change its content to "edited"  
$html->find('*[class*=editable]', 0)->innertext = "Edited";

// save the file
$html->save(index.php);
 [1]: http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/manual_api.htm simple php dom parser UPDATE I have been playing around with regular expressions to try and match the includes. I am pretty rubbish at regex but I think I am getting close. Here is what I have so far: $findinclude = '/(?:include|include_once|require|require_once)\s*(?:[a-z]|"|\(|\)|\'|_|\.|\s|\/)*(?=(?:[^\<\?]|[^\?\>])*\?>)/i';
 This matches fairly well although it does seem to return the odd ) and ' when using preg_match. I am trying to add a bit of security into the regex to ensure it only matches between php tags - this part: (?=(?:[^\<\?]|[^\?>])*\?>) - but it only returns the first include on a page. Any tips on how to improve this regular expression? (I have been at it for about 6 hours)
@CODE:<?php
include header.php;
?>

<h2>Hello</h2>
<p class="editable">Lorem ipsum dolar doo dah day</p>

<?php

?> <html>
<head>
<title>This is my page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="editable">My Website rocks</h1> <p>The end of my page</p>
</body> // load the class and file
$html = new simple_html_dom();
$html->load_file("index.php");

// find the first editable area and change its content to "edited"  
$html->find('*[class*=editable]', 0)->innertext = "Edited";

// save the file
$html->save(index.php); $findinclude = '/(?:include|include_once|require|require_once)\s*(?:[a-z]|"|\(|\)|\'|_|\.|\s|\/)*(?=(?:[^\<\?]|[^\?\>])*\?>)/i';

@TITLE:Rename standard ¡§edit¡¨ button in tableview
@CONTENT:I managed (with lots of trial and error) to have my tableview provide only reordering functionality, i.e. my tableview is editable but does not display "delete icons" nor indents the rows upon clicking on the edit button. Now I would like the button to read "sort" instead of "edit". I naively tried this: self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = self.editButtonItem;
self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem.title = @"Sort";
 which works only once, i.e. it is correctly labeled "Sort", once clicked it renames to "Done", but then--as expected--it re-renames to "Edit". In order to fix this, I deployed my "own" button on the navbar. This solution works--I can get the button to control the tableview editing mode, reload the data upon change, rename itself, etc--but I cannot get it to "stay highlighted", i.e. the default behaviour of the "Edit" button in a tableview. Now my question is either: a) Is there a way to rename (and keep it renamed, e.g. through a callback) the standard "Edit" button? or b) Is there a way to have a button behave "modally", i.e. stay selected, like the standard "Edit" button? Thanks for any idea you might have.

@CONTENT:Is there any way of replacing the logic within a private method when running a JUnit test? A bit of background: we have some private methods which interact with bundles within an OSGi container. This is not available in the unit test therefore the methods will fail. We have looked at JMockIt but the method replace functionality seems to want to force you to replace all the methods in the class which call one another. The implementation would be something like this: public final doSomething() {  
    firstThing();
    secondThing();
}
private firstThing() {  
    // normal code
}
private secondThing() {  
    // code which is unavailable in a unit test
}
 And the unit test would specify the new implementation of secondThing(): // replace secondThing() in impl with this secondThing()

private secondThing() {  
    // dummy code
}

// run tests
@CODE:public final doSomething() {  
    firstThing();
    secondThing();

 In the security-config.xml file, I have the following configuration: <http>
  <!-- Restrict URLs based on role -->
  <intercept-url pattern="/WEB-INF/jsp/login.jsp*" access="ROLE_ANONYMOUS" />
  <intercept-url pattern="/WEB-INF/jsp/header.jsp*" access="ROLE_ANONYMOUS" />

 However, I can't even navigate to the login page and get the following error in the log: WARNING: The login page is being protected by the filter chain, but you don't appear to have anonymous authentication enabled. This is almost certainly an error. I've tried changing the ROLE_ANONYMOUS to IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, changing the login-page to index.jsp, login.htm, and adding different intercept-url values, but I can't get it so the login page is accesible and security applies to the other pages.

When I run my application, however, the control shows either a blue screen with a piece of text saying "We are sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level for this region" or a bright screen with completely no data (when I change zoom level). Here is my code:   GMapMain.MapType = MapType.GoogleMap;
  GMapMain.MaxZoom = 100;
  GMapMain.MinZoom = 0;
  GMapMain.Zoom = 50;
  GMapMain.CurrentPosition = new PointLatLng(54.6961334816182, 25.2985095977783);

  GMapMain.ReloadMap();      
 Please help. I have no idea what to do and I cannot find any information in the Internet that could help me solve the problem. Thank you very much in advance.

@TITLE:Background script on shared host with multiple PHP versions installed
@CONTENT:I was needing a way to generate thumbnails (using PHP5) for an image management script and had a problem where my host has multiple versions of PHP installed (4 and 5), with PHP4 set as default. This meant that any calls to php from the CLI would run PHP4. I've come up with the following as what I hope to be a cross platform solution. I'm posting it here primarily as I had a lot of trouble finding any help using Google, so this might help someone in the future, I also have the following questions. Do you see anything obviously wrong with it? Are there any other paths to the php5 binary that you know of or know of a better order to have the array for optimisation? If a host has exec or shell_exec disabled, will the EGalleryProcessQueue.php script be able to be run as a standalone cron job? I don't have access to cron to be able to test this yet. I'm not too worried about this question, as I'll get around to testing it eventually anyway. Does anyone have any suggestions as to a way in which I can get some feedback as to how far through the images the processing is? See the TODO section of EGalleryProcessQueue.php I'd like to display a progress bar when it's in the admin section. Main script /**

@TITLE:Finding approximately duplicate database records using T-SQL?
@CONTENT:Hey all. I have a MSSQL 2008 database with a fair number of rows. As of now, before new rows are inserted into the table, the stored procedure checks to see if that record already exists in the database (by checking a column labeled Title). This check is exact, and if the to-be-inserted record is slightly different, it will insert it instead of updating the existing row (which is an approximate match). What I would like to do is somehow detect approximate duplications in the table before inserting. So a new record that is to be inserted: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
 would approximately match: Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
 if this record exists in the table already. I've seen (and used for other situations) the Levenshtein Distance algorithm implemented in T-SQL, but I'm not sure if this could be applied in my case because a pair of input strings are required to execute the algorithm. How are members of the community handing things of this sort? Thanks.

@TITLE:Enforcing relationship between Managed Thread and OS Thread (CUDA usecase)
@CONTENT:Problem I'm trying to create an CUDA application that is well integrated with .net. The design goal is to have several CUDA functions that can be called from managed code. Data should also be able to persist on a device between function calls, so that it can be passed to multiple CUDA functions. It is of importance that each individual piece of data is only accessed by a single OS thread (as required by CUDA) My Strategy I'm wrapping CUDA functionalities and device pointers in Managed C++ code. A CUDA device pointer can be wrapped in a DevicePointer class written in MC++. If the class tracks which thread it is using, it can enforce that only a single thread can access the CUDA device pointer. I'll then design the program so that only a single thread would attempt to access any given piece of data. Where I need help I've done some research, and read about the distinction between managed threads and OS threads. It seems that there is, in general, a many to many relationship between the two. This means that even though I'm only using a single managed thread, it could switch OS threads, and I'll loose access to a device pointer. Is there any way to force the CLR to not move a managed thread between OS threads?

The problem is that the format of the Washington address varies from time to time. Sometimes there are bullets, pipes, new lines and break-tags making it difficult to match. I'm attempting to crawl many pages to retrieve addresses which are largely similar: ignore peculiar whitespace. It's merely to show string-part similarities

 Each of these will come back individually surrounded by tons of other text and html tags. The addresses may even contain an <br> or <br/> within the address itself. What I would like to do is capture the first match from the source string, and set it as the value of a variable. From my understanding, this would best be approached with a regular-expression. Update: After learning more about the various ways in which these days can appear, I've decided that a less-strict expression would be best. These addresses have been showing up with bullets, pipes, and newlines. Perhaps an expression that communicates the following would be best: [numbers][anything]["washington"][anything][DC|D.C.][anything][five numbers] Apparently that is way too loose. The anything blocks were bringing in paragraphs, when I'm merely interested in allowing a few chars of anything.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use partial template specialization on a (non-member) function, and I'm tripping up on the syntax. I've searched StackOverflow for other partial template specialization questions, but those deal with partial specialization of a class or member function template. For a starting point, I have: struct RGBA {
    RGBA(uint8 red, uint8 green, uint8 blue, uint8 alpha = 255) :
        r(red), g(green), b(blue), a(alpha)
    {}

    uint8 r, g, b, a;
};

struct Grayscale {
    Grayscale(uint8 intensity) : value(intensity) {}

    uint8 value;
};

inline uint8 IntensityFromRGB(uint8 r, uint8 g, uint8 b) {
    return static_cast<uint8>(0.30*r + 0.59*g + 0.11*b);
}

// Generic pixel conversion.  Must specialize this template for specific
// conversions.
template <typename InType, typename OutType>
OutType ConvertPixel(InType source);
 I can do a complete specialization of ConvertPixel to make an RGBA to Grayscale conversion function like this: template <>
Grayscale ConvertPixel<RGBA, Grayscale>(RGBA source) {
    return Grayscale(IntensityFromRGB(source.r, source.g, source.b));
}
 I'll conceivably have more pixel types that offer red, green, and blue, but perhaps in a different format, so what I'd really like to do is a partial specialization by specifying Grayscale for OutType and still allow for a variety of InTypes. I've tried a variety of approaches like this: template <typename InType>
Grayscale ConvertPixel<InType, Grayscale>(InType source) {
    return Grayscale(IntensityFromRGB(source.r, source.g, source.b));
}
 But the (Microsoft VS 2008 C++) compiler rejects it. Is what I'm attempting possible? If so, what's the right syntax?
@CODE:struct RGBA {
    RGBA(uint8 red, uint8 green, uint8 blue, uint8 alpha = 255) :
        r(red), g(green), b(blue), a(alpha)
    {}

    uint8 r, g, b, a;
};

struct Grayscale {
    Grayscale(uint8 intensity) : value(intensity) {}

    uint8 value;
};

inline uint8 IntensityFromRGB(uint8 r, uint8 g, uint8 b) {
    return static_cast<uint8>(0.30*r + 0.59*g + 0.11*b);
}

// Generic pixel conversion.  Must specialize this template for specific
// conversions.
template <typename InType, typename OutType>
OutType ConvertPixel(InType source); template <>
Grayscale ConvertPixel<RGBA, Grayscale>(RGBA source) {
    return Grayscale(IntensityFromRGB(source.r, source.g, source.b));
} Grayscale OutType InType template <typename InType>
Grayscale ConvertPixel<InType, Grayscale>(InType source) {
    return Grayscale(IntensityFromRGB(source.r, source.g, source.b));
}

@TITLE:NSOutlineView with Bindings driven by Core Data
@CONTENT:I've got an NSOutlineView acting as a source list for my application, and my data model is done with Core Data. I'd like to use bindings (if possible) to glue these things together as follows: I have three main entities in my model, for sake of example let's call them "Stores", "Cars" and "People". My goal is to have the outline view have 3 "groups" (expandable nodes, like PLAYLISTS in iTunes), each group representing and listing one of my entities, and also I've got three buttons at the bottom of my window to "Add Store", "Add Car", etc which I'd like to have wired up to perform that action. So far in my window's nib I've got a TreeController which is bound to my NSManagedObjectContext instance of my window controller, but I can't figure out how to properly bind and populate the outline view from the TreeController. Is this possible with bindings? I've seen one tutorial where a second managed object model is created, with entities for the outline nodes, but some comments on the article said this was a bad idea. I'm not really sure how to proceed, any help would be wonderful!

The OS is Windows Server 2003 and the reports are being viewed on IE8 running XP. It's not a big deal. Refreshing the browser brings the report right up each time.

@TITLE:Runtime Issues While Mixing Libraries from Different Versions of Visual Studio
@CONTENT:I have encountered an unexpected Access Error while running a project I've built using two different versions of Visual Studio. My general configuration is as follows: LibA is a static lib, static runtime linkage, msvc 8.0 LibB is a static lib, static runtime linkage, msvc 9.0 My target project for integration is a msvc 9.0 COM dll, which statically links the above libraries This project builds, but crashes up at runtime with an access violation in some STL code. The stack seems to indicate that I've passed through headers both versions (8 and 9) during a call into a stream insertion operator. I realize that this is a problem. Somehow, this call: ost << std::dec << port_; //(originating from an object in LibA)
 ...descends through the following stack trace: std::basic_ostream::operator<<(...) (ostream:283, msvc 8.0 version <-- expected, since LibA was built with this version)
std::num_put::put(...) (xlocnum:888, msvc 8.0 version <-- expected, since LibA was built with this version)
std::num_put::do_put(...) (xlocnum:1158, msvc 9.0 version!! !@#$!%! <-- not expected, since LibA was built with msvc 8.0)
std::ios_base::flags() (xiosbase:374, msvc 9.0 version <-- follows from above)
 The access violation happens in std::ios_base::flags(). I suspect it is due to the mix of implementations in the call stack (although I am not sure). My questions are. 1.) Is the likely cause of this access violation the mixing of msvc header implementations? 2.) Is there a way to prevent these implementations from mixing? 3.) Is there a better way to configure these three projects for integration (assuming moving LibA from msvc 8.0 is undesirable)? I am aware of the ideas raised in this question and this one. Here I am most interested in this specific problem, and if there is some way to avoid it. Any insights would be appreciated.

@TITLE:Database: Best practice - old data?
@CONTENT:I have a database of automobile classified listings. After 90 days, the classified listing is no longer valid to be displayed (the listing expires); however, I want to retain the listing for archive purposes. Question: From a database design best practice perspective as well as query performance, is it better to keep the old listing A) in the same table as the current listing or B), move the expired listing over to an expired table and delete that listing from the current listing table? In other words, Option A): table_classified_listing:
car_id
expired = true | false
...
 Option B): // only current listing in this table (expired = false)
table_classified_listing:
car_id
...

// only expired listing in this table (expired = true)
expired_table_classified_listing:
car_id
...
 UPDATE: My concern with Option A, is that in my MySQL database - when I run EXPLAIN, it say that it's using the expired as the primary key to index on. However, what's more important to my query search performance is for it to use the price field since I'm doing a search based on the price > X. Hence why I'm considering to chose option B.
@CODE:table_classified_listing:
car_id
expired = true | false
... // only current listing in this table (expired = false)
table_classified_listing:
car_id
...

// only expired listing in this table (expired = true)

@TITLE:Network Communication between a java socket (server) and a C++ socket (client)
@CONTENT:I know this must be a pretty common problem, but I haven't been able to find a definitive answer on how to do it. First, assume we have a java server that accepts queries such as (I've just put the relevant lines, and I've taken out the exception handling for clarity):     ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(port);
    while (true) {
        ClientWorker w;
        w = new ClientWorker(socket.accept());
        Thread t = new Thread(w);
        t.start();
    }
 and then in the ClientWorker 	BufferedReader inFromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));
	DataOutputStream outToClient = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());

	String query = inFromClient.readLine();
    // process query here
	String response = "testresponse";

	outToClient.writeBytes(response + "\n");

	outToClient.close();
	inFromClient.close();
	client.close();
 Right now I can get a java client that works with this server: String query = "testquery";
Socket queryProcessorSocket = new Socket(queryIp,queryPort);
DataOutputStream queryProcessorDos = new DataOutputStream(queryProcessorSocket.getOutputStream());
BufferedReader queryProcessorReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(queryProcessorSocket.getInputStream()));
queryProcessorDos.writeBytes(query + "\n");
String response = queryProcessorReader.readLine();
 But how can I get a C++ client to do the same thing as the java client? I've tried many things but nothing seems to work. Ideally I wouldn't want to touch the java server, is that possible? If someone could point me to a good example or some sample code, that would be much appreciated. I searched through a lot of websites but to no avail.
@CODE:ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(port);
    while (true) {
        ClientWorker w;
        w = new ClientWorker(socket.accept());
        Thread t = new Thread(w);
        t.start();
    } BufferedReader inFromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));
	DataOutputStream outToClient = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());

	String query = inFromClient.readLine();
    // process query here
	String response = "testresponse";

	outToClient.writeBytes(response + "\n");

	outToClient.close();
	inFromClient.close();

Socket queryProcessorSocket = new Socket(queryIp,queryPort);
DataOutputStream queryProcessorDos = new DataOutputStream(queryProcessorSocket.getOutputStream());

@CONTENT:I am trying to building a XSS widget and am having issues with Webkit browsers loading the external javascript files which I am appending into the dom. It works as below: Widget.js appends 3 javascript files into the dom (jquery, data, content) Jquery.js is standard jquery with a custom namespace Data.js is a javascript array Content.js is a set of jQuery instructions to build the widget based off the data in Data.js In firefox the browser does exactly 100% of the time what im telling it and the widget loads where ever you placed the include javascript on the page. However in Webkit ie Safari, the browser returns the 3 files in a random order, and executes once returned. This means that when Content.js looks for $ to do jquery magic it fails.

I download the Retro Clock application on my android phone and noticed that when I click it, it pops up the Alarm Clock settings, but with the default Google Analog Clock widget, upon click does nothing. Is that because the Retro Clock widget implements the Alarm Clock service? If so, how can I go about referencing that service? Or do I have this all wrong and misunderstood? Any help is appreciated. EDIT: I believe implementing the service to update the clock would drain the battery life tremendously, any ideas on a work around or help shed some light on any performance issues with using Service?

@TITLE:Php lottery issues multi winner problems
@CONTENT:I have created a lottery script in php. My problem is now selecting more then one winner. Because it is possible for players to have the same number on their tickets. Here I am supplying the two table structures and the source code. lotto_game {
	id(int)
	jackpot(int)
	status(varchar10)
	pick_1(int)
	pick_2(int)
	pick_3(int)
	pick_4(int)
	pick_5(int)

 lotto_picks {
	lotto_id(int)

	choice_1(int)
	choice_2(int)
	choice_3(int)
	choice_4(int)
	choice_5(int)
	ticket_status(int)
}
 These are my two tables with in my database. For examples sake we will create 2 users with the id's 1, and 2. So what happens is when the script runs it is suppose to change the lotto_game status from 'active' to 'finished' then add the random lottery numbers into each pick_* column. $one = rand(1,30);
$two = rand(1,30); 
$three = rand(1,30);
$four = rand(1,30);
$five = rand(1,30);

mysql_query("UPDATE `lotto_game` SET 
 pick_1 = '$one',
 pick_2 = '$two',
 pick_3 = '$three',
 pick_4 = '$four',
 pick_5 = '$five',
 status = 'finished'
 WHERE status = 'active'"); That wasn't too hard I will admit. But this is just the beginning of the end. $lotto['tickets'] = mysql_query("SELECT ticket_id FROM `lotto_picks` WHERE ticket_status='valid'");

@$lotto[winners] = mysql_query("SELECT ticket_id,user_id FROM `lotto_picks` WHERE choice_1 = '$one' AND choice_2 = '$two' AND choice_3 = '$three' AND choice_4 = '$four' AND choice_5 = '$five'");

$lotto['num_tickets'] = mysql_num_rows($lotto['tickets']);
@$lotto[winner_id] = mysql_fetch_array(@$lotto[winners]);
$lotto['jackpot'] = mysql_query("SELECT jackpot FROM `lotto_game` WHERE status='active'");

$lotto['winner_jackpot'] = mysql_fetch_array($lotto['jackpot']);
$lotto['num_winners'] = mysql_num_rows($lotto['winners']);
//echo @$lotto['num_tickets'];
//echo @$lotto['num_winners'];
$winner = $lotto['num_winners'];
//echo @$lotto['winner_id']['user_id'];
$jackpot = $lotto['winner_jackpot']['jackpot'];
$id = @$lotto[winner_id][user_id];
if ($winner == 1) {
    mysql_query("UPDATE `character` SET
    decivers = decivers +'$jackpot'
WHERE user_id='$id'");
}
 This is what I have come up with and it really seems to work with one winner. But I just cant figure out where to go from here. I have tried using some arrays but nothing works. I know what needs to be done but can't figure out how to do it. When I search for winners I need to put into an array all their user id's. so extra decivers is money, if anyone is confused on that. The status on the tickets doesn't really matter here but if you must know it just determines if the ticket_status is 'valid' or 'invalid'

@CONTENT:I stumbled across this: http://en.literateprograms.org/Vending_Machine_%28java%29 It is a java vending machine, I want to read it and also follow along, write the same code. What's the fastest way to get java setup such that I can just start coding the java vending machine as I read along? I was in the process of downloading the Java SE Development Kit 6u17 for Windows, Multi-language, when I looked to the right hand side of the same page and just realized that I can also download Netbeans. Again, the question is what's the best java IDE or compiler that a newb like me can use to do the java vending machine linked to above. Or What are the java programmers using to code java with? I am new to java, C++ is easy to install and start coding, likewise so is PHP, but java just seems like an interesting new beast to me, thank you for not flaming.

@CONTENT:This question is based on a previous question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1917935/how-does-c-compilation-get-around-needing-header-files. Confirmation that C# compilation makes use of multiple passes essentially answers my original question. Also, the answers indicated that C# uses type and method signature metadata stored in assemblies to check code syntax at compile time. Q: how does C/C++/Objective-C know what code to load at run time that was linked at compile-time? And to tie it into a technology I'm familiar with, how does C#/CLR do this? Correct me if I'm wrong, but for C#/CLR, my intuitive understanding is that certain paths are checked for assemblies upon execution, and basically all code is loaded and linked dynamically at run time. Edit: Updated to include C++ and Objective-C with C. Update: To clarify, what I really am curious about is how C/C++/Objective-C compilation matches an "externally defined" symbol in my source with the actual implementation of that code, what is the compilation output, and basically how the compilation output is executed by the microprocessor to seamlessly pass control into the library code (in terms of instruction pointer). I have done this with the CLR virtual machine, but am curious to know how this works conceptually in C++/Objective-C on an actual microprocessor.

 I am using jquery and I need some guidance. Can anyone tell me some jquery code please? --UPDATE-- There are many div with calss='status', so how can I tell jquery that I want to change the css which I clicked. --UPDATE 2-- I want to check the value(active/inactive). And add it's value as class. e.x If its value is active, then add css class='active' and if it is inactive then class='inactive' etc. Can I do it? Or you have other suggestions how I should do it. --UPDATE 3-- Thanks everyone. You guys rock. I tested some of codes. But the problem is that when I click active, it change the bg, but then refreshes the page to change to inactive via php/mysql. So this means each time I click the value(active/inactive) changes. So I think as I stated in update 2, it might be good idea to add css class depends on the value. More suggestions are welcome and I appreciate them. (I have not done it with AJAX yet...) --UPDATE 4 -- Using ID is not a good idea since the table is created dynamically. I can add IDs but it will add more code. So I thought class is better. --UPDATE 5-- I moved my question here. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1909223/how-to-add-a-class-depends-on-value-with-jquery After this, I now know what I want to do.

 now if a dba changes the value of FailPasswordAttemptCount to 4 without changing IsCaptchaActivated to true then this will make an invalid entry for my frontend.

@TITLE:Is this the correct way to use and test a class that makes use of the factory pattern?
@CONTENT:I don't have a lot of experience with the factory pattern and I've come across a scenario where I believe it is necessary but I'm not sure the I've implemented the pattern correctly and I'm concerned about the impact it's had on the readability of my unit tests. I've created a code snippet that approximates (from memory) the essence of the scenario I am working on at work. I'd really appreciate it if someone could take a look at it and see if what I've done seems reasonable. This is the class I need to test: public class SomeCalculator : ICalculateSomething
{
	private readonly IReducerFactory reducerFactory;
	private IReducer reducer;

	public SomeCalculator(IReducerFactory reducerFactory)
	{
		this.reducerFactory = reducerFactory;
	}

	public SomeCalculator() : this(new ReducerFactory()){}

	public decimal Calculate(SomeObject so)
	{	
		reducer = reducerFactory.Create(so.CalculationMethod);

		decimal calculatedAmount = so.Amount * so.Amount;

		return reducer.Reduce(so, calculatedAmount);
	}
}
 Here are some of the basic interface definitions... public interface ICalculateSomething
{
	decimal Calculate(SomeObject so);
}

public interface IReducerFactory
{
	IReducer Create(CalculationMethod cm);
}

public interface IReducer
{
	decimal Reduce(SomeObject so, decimal amount);
}
 This is the factory I've created. My current requirements have had me add a specific Reducer MethodAReducer to be used in a particular scenario which is why I'm trying to introduce a factory. public class ReducerFactory : IReducerFactory
{
	public IReducer Create(CalculationMethod cm)
	{
		switch(cm.Method)
		{
			case CalculationMethod.MethodA:
				return new MethodAReducer();
				break;
			default:
				return DefaultMethodReducer();
				break;
		}
	}
}
 These are approximations of the two implementations... The essence of the implementation is that it only reduces the amount if the object is in a particular state. public class MethodAReducer : IReducer

 This is the test fixture I am using. What has concerned me is how much space in the tests the factory pattern has taken up and how it appears to reduce the readability of the test. Please keep in mind that in my real world class I have several dependencies that I need to mock out which means that the tests here are several lines shorter than the ones needed for my real world test. [TestFixture]
public class SomeCalculatorTests
{
	private Mock<IReducerFactory> reducerFactory;
	private SomeCalculator someCalculator;

	[Setup]
	public void Setup()
	{
		reducerFactory = new Mock<IReducerFactory>();
		someCalculator = new SomeCalculator(reducerFactory.Object);		
	}

	[Teardown]
	public void Teardown(){}
 First test 	//verify that we can calculate an amount
	[Test]
	public void Calculate_CalculateTheAmount_ReturnsTheAmount()
	{
		decimal amount = 10;
		decimal expectedAmount = 100;
		SomeObject so = new SomeObjectBuilder()
		 .WithCalculationMethod(new CalculationMethodBuilder())								                             
                     .WithAmount(amount);

		Mock<IReducer> reducer = new Mock<IReducer>();

		reducer
			.Setup(p => p.Reduce(so, expectedAmount))
			.Returns(expectedAmount);

		reducerFactory
			.Setup(p => p.Create(It.IsAny<CalculationMethod>))
			.Returns(reducer);

		decimal actualAmount = someCalculator.Calculate(so);

		Assert.That(actualAmount, Is.EqualTo(expectedAmount));
	}
 Second test 	//Verify that we make the call to reduce the calculated amount
	[Test]
	public void Calculate_CalculateTheAmount_ReducesTheAmount()
	{
		decimal amount = 10;
		decimal expectedAmount = 100;
		SomeObject so = new SomeObjectBuilder()
		 .WithCalculationMethod(new CalculationMethodBuilder())

I can build arbitrary surfaces/polygon shapes (as in http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/graphcode.php?graph=135 ) and I can make the respective 2D plot. What I don't seem to be able to figure out is the way to put them together in a nice way (like the one shown in the jpg above). I've tried googling for the answer, but I wasn't able to find anything similar done in R. Any help would be greatly appreciated! EDIT: The 2D portion is not a projection of the 2D one. I chose this specific picture to illustrate this. For example Here the 2D portion is the image of the circuit and on the 3D portion is the temperature). In 2D you can have the map of a city and in 3D the traffic etc... Best, Bruno

@TITLE:Does three-tier architecture ever work?
@CONTENT:We are building three-tier architectures for over a decade now. Dividing presentation-, logic- and data-tier is supposed to allow us to exchange each layer individually, should the need ever arise, be it through changed requirements or new technologies. I have never seen it working in practice... Mostly because (at least) one of the following reasons: The three tiers concept was only visible in the source code (e.g. package naming in Java) which was then deployed as one, tied together package. The code representing each layer was nicely bundled in its own deployable format but then thrown into the same process (e.g. an "enterprise container"). Each layer was run in its own process, sometimes even on different machines but through the static nature they were connected to each other, replacing one of them meant breaking all of them. Thus what you usually end up with, in is a monolithic, tightly coupled system that does not deliver what it's architecture promised. I therefore think "three-tier architecture" is a total misnomer. The true benefit it brings is that the code is logically sound. But that's at "write time", not at "run time". A better name would be something like "layered by responsibility". In any case, the "architecture" word is misleading. What are your thoughts on this? How could working three-tier architecture be achieved? By that I mean one which holds its promises: Allowing to plug out a layer without affecting the other ones. The system should survive that and be in a well defined state afterwards. Thanks!

 But this isn't enough... For instance, lets say the field headline contains something like Bmw 330ci. If I search for 330, I wont get any results. The ending ('ci') is just one of many endings in car models which must be taken into account when searching the table. Or what if the headline field is bmw330? Also no results, because it only matches full words. Or also, what if the headline is bmw 330, and I search for bmw 520, still with FULLTEXT I will get the bmw 330 as a result, even though I searched for bmw 520... Not good! How should I solve this problem?

@CONTENT:I have a query that joins 5 tables. Then I fill my hand-made object with the column values that I need. What are solutions here that are wide-common to solve that problem using specific tools ? are there such tools? I'm only beginning to learn Hibernate, so my question would be: is Hibernate the right decision for this problem? Hibernate maps a table to a class. So, there's no difference if I would have 5 classes instead of 5 tables. It would still be difficult to join the query result into a class Could hibernate be used to map THE QUERY into the structure (class) I would define beforehand as we do with table mapping? Or even better, can it map the query result into the meaningful fields [auto-create the class with fields] as it does with reverse-engineering? I've been thinking about views but.. create a new view everytime we need a complex query.. too verbose. As S.Lott asked, here is a simple version of a question: General problem: 
select A.field_a, B.field_b, C.field_c 
 from table_a A inner join table_b B inner join table_c C 
 where ...
 every table contains 100 fields query returns 3 fields, but every field belongs to the unique table How do I solve that problem in an OO style? Design a new object with properties corresponding to the returning values of the query. I want to know if it is the right [and the only one possible] decision and are there any common solutions.

@TITLE:FindByIdentity failing with PricipalOperationException in ASP.NET webapp
@CONTENT:I'm struggling with an issue in utilizing System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement in my internal web application. The error is not very descriptive, but here's what's going on: When I attempt to validate that a provided user id exists in the AD, I do so with the following code: private bool IsWindowsIDValid(string strWindowsID) 
{ 
var context = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "DOMAINSERVER", "DC=DOMAINNAME,DC=net"); 
var userPrincipal = UserPrincipal.FindByIdentity(context, strWindowsID); 
return (userPrincipal != null); 
}
 However, an exception is throw at the second line, where FindByIdentity is called. Here are the exception details: Message: "An operations error occurred." Stack trace: at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.DoLDAPDirectoryInit() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.DoDomainInit() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.Initialize() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalContext.get_QueryCtx() at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.Principal.FindByIdentityWithTypeHelper(PrincipalContext context, Type principalType, Nullable`1 identityType, String identityValue, DateTime refDate) at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.Principal.FindByIdentityWithType(PrincipalContext context, Type principalType, String identityValue) at System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal.FindByIdentity(PrincipalContext context, String identityValue) at .IsWindowsIDValid(String strWindowsID) in .ascx.cs:line 193 This same error occurs if I attempt to examine the ConnectedServer property of the PrincipalContext as well. However, I can attempt to validate credentials against the context (using context.ValidateCredentials()), and it will pass just fine. Any ideas as to what may be going on? I can run this code just fine in a stand alone console script on my machine - this is occurring in my local development environment, inside VisualStudio, when I attempt to debug the webapp. Is this a permissions issue or something else perhaps? I'm pretty lost at this point. I appreciate any help! -Patrick

@TITLE:Trying to derive a 2D transformation matrix using only the images
@CONTENT:I dunno if this should go in a Math forum or a Programming forums, but I'll post it in both and see where I get. I have two computer images... one of them is an "original" image (a large TIF file). The other one is a transformed version of the original image... it's been rotated, sheared and translated in a software program. I need to do some work on the transformed image, but I need the (x-y) coordinates of each pixel in the original image to finish my calculations. I know that the image was rotated and sheared with a 3x3 Transformation matrix. If I had the matrix, I could derive the second image from the first (or vice-versa) myself. I don't know exactly how much it was rotated, sheared, or translated, so I can't just derive the matrices from a set of known transformations. What I do have is a set of corresponding points (the corners, et al) in each image, and their corresponding (x,y) coordinates. So here's my dilemma: Using a set of corresponding transformed points ((x,y) -> (x',y'), three or more of them), can I derive the Transformation matrix that was used to turn one image into the other? If I can derive the matrix, I can solve for the original coordinates of all the pixels (all 18-million of 'em) and get the calculations done that I need to do. Can anyone help? I'm familiar with linear algebra... just not familiar enough to derive this without a whole lotta head scratching. Anything is appreciated! Mike

@CONTENT:I?m writing two litle c++ apps that must communicate. First one will be a service which, every once in a while, must alert the user for something. Since a service cannot create windows I designed the app to be two separate executables. The service will use a notifier to communicate. The service needs only to send text messages to the notifier wich will show up a balloon at system tray. I?m trying to use named pipes and I think I?m almost there, but not quite there. What I have so far is: At the notifier side:   m_hInPipe = CreateNamedPipe(L"\\\\.\\pipe\\nhsupspipe", PIPE_ACCESS_INBOUND,
                PIPE_WAIT, 1, 1024, 1024, 60, NULL);
 Meaning I created a pipe named nhsupspipe, an inbound pipe. At the service side: if (!WriteFile(m_hOutPipe, "My message to the user?", 23, &escritos, &o))
     std::cout << "ERROR: " << GetLastError();
 Debugging I can see that it is all ok, the pipe is created and the WriteFile writes my 23 bytes to the pipe. My question is: How, in the notifier side I?ll be able to read these bytes? Is there any message sent to the process? Do I have to write a handler for the pipe? Anything?

pg_restore -d myDatabaseCopy -h myServer -U myUser myDatabase.tar
 Then I get this error, and the import fails for an entire table. psql:/home/me/myDatabase.tar:660266: ERROR: value too long for type character varying(100) CONTEXT: COPY myTable, line 591, column myColumn: "A former member of the State Department?s ?Future of Iraq? project and now at the Atlantic Cou..." Those hat-a's are those annoying curly single and double quotes. It looks to me like they fit in the column at first, but somewhere in the export / import process they expand, and then no longer fit in the character varying(100) column. I'm actually moving a live database on a server I have little permission for, so a sql only solution would be great. Is there a way to do something like UPDATE myTable SET myColumn = removeNonAscii(myColumn) WHERE hasNonAscii(myColumn)
 EDIT: habe got it. I changed createdb -h myServer -U myUser -T template0 myDatabaseCopy
 to createdb -h myServer -U myUser -T template0 -E UTF8 myDatabaseCopy
 and that did the trick.
@CODE:# Dump my database to a tar file

@TITLE:Making a Flex DataGrid scroll smoothly
@CONTENT:I've noticed that the default behaviour for a DataGrid's vertical scroll bar is to scroll one row at a time. This is all well and good when the rows are all uniform and small (e.g. displaying a single line of text), but gets really ugly as soon as you have rows with variable heights. I'm curious, is there a way to make DataGrid scrolling "smooth"? For instance, is there a way to have the DataGrid scroll by a set number of pixels, lines of text, etc. rather than scrolling one row at a time? So far, the only solution I've managed to come up with is to place the DataGrid in a Canvas and have the Canvas do the scrolling instead of the DataGrid. The issue with this approach, though, is that as soon as the Canvas scrolls far enough, the DataGrid headers scroll off-screen. Ideally, I'd like to get the smooth-scrolling nature of the Canvas, but also keep the DataGrid headers visible. Is that possible?

@CONTENT:I've recently run into some problems with the CookieContainer. Either I'm doing something seriously wrong or there is some kind of bug w/ the CookieContainer object. It doesn't seem to update the cookie collection with certain Set-Cookie headers. This might be a lengthy post and I appologize, but I want to be as thurough as possible so I'm going to list my HTTP sniffing logs as well as my actual implementation code.     public bool SendRequest(HttpWebRequest request, IDictionary<string, string> data, int retries)

        // copy request in case request instance already failed
        HttpWebRequest newRequest = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(request.RequestUri);
        newRequest.Method = request.Method;

        // if POST data was provided, write it to the stream
        if (data != null && data.Count != 0)
        {
            StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(newRequest.GetRequestStream());
            writer.Write(createPostString(data));
            writer.Close();
        }

        // set request with global cookie container
        newRequest.CookieContainer = this.cookieJar;

        try
        {
            using (HttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)newRequest.GetResponse())
            {
                //CookieCollection newCooks = getCookies(resp.Headers);

I want to be able to update version A straight to version C. For the application files this is simple, I just replace the old with the new ones. However for the database I do not wish to generate a SQL Script to change the database schema from A straight to C, instead I want first apply a script to change the schema from A to B and from B to C. How can I store the database version for a SQL Server database? Is there any special property which I can set, instead of implementing a version table?

Thanks! Edit: This is homework, but I've already submitted this assignment and I'd just like to know if my answer correct. I get a little confused over Big-O complexity when recursion is involved. Original question below: I'm trying to find the complexity of an all-paths search as given by this algorithm. Given two vertices, I'm finding all simple paths between them using a depth-first search. I know that the time complexity of DFS is O(V+E) and its space complexity is O(V), and my intuition is that the complexity of an all-paths search will be more than that, but I'm unable to determine what it will be. Related SO questions here and here. Update (in response to a comment below): I'm trying to solve the six degrees of Kevin Bacon problem. This generally requires finding the lowest degree of separation between a pair of actors, but I have to find ALL degrees of separation (for now, less than 6, but this can change).

The VM needs to track calls to find hotspots and when it uses compiled code it needs to provid ways to change the compiled method on fly if a new loaded class requires a recompilation. I guess there is also a return stack overflow check somewhere.

@CONTENT:We have set up an Solr index containing 36 million documents (~1K-2K each) and we try to query a maximum of 100 documents matching a single simple keyword. This works pretty fast as we had hoped for. However, if we now add "&sort=createDate+desc" to the query (thus asking for the top 100 'new' documents matching the query) it runs for a long, very long time and finally results in an OutOfMemoryException. From what I've understood from the manual this is caused by the fact that Lucene needs to load all the distinct values for this field (createDate) into memory (the FieldCache afaik) before it can execute the query. As the createDate field contains date and time the number of distinct values is pretty large. Also important to mention is that we frequently update the index. Perhaps someone can provide some insights and directions on how we can tune Lucene / Solr or change our approach in such a way that query times become acceptable? Your input will be much appreciated!

parseit()
 Of course the problem is jruby cannot find 'nokogiri' as I have not installed it aka nokogiri-java via jruby -S gem install nokogiri The reason is there is some bug I found in nokogiri running under Jruby, so I have only installed nokogiri on Ruby not Jruby. The parser.rb runs perfectly under just Ruby. So my objective is to be able to run parseit() without having to install nokogiri on Jruby!

@TITLE:C#, how to check if value is encrypted using MD5 passphrase?
@CONTENT:I have the following code to encrypt a value (listed below). Now I would like to write a bool isEncrypted() method. Is there a fool proof and reliable way to check if a value has been encrypted using this function. I have the decrypt routine and can control the pass phrase, but not sure if that will help. The reason is - when the app first runs, values in a configuration file are not encrypted, in this case the app should auto encrypt these values. On 2nd run I don't want to encrypt again because obviously that would cause havoc. Lastly I don't want to have to add an isEncrypted attribute to the config value. I want it to work and look as dynamic as possible. So far I am leaning towards using the len (128) as deciding factor, but there is always a remote chance of the unencrypted value also being this length.

@CONTENT:I'm using ASP.NET MVC with Castle ActiveRecord as my persistance layer. I want to know if it's possible to show the SQL queries being executed on my MySQL server. I know it's possible in a Web application using the "show_sql" property in the Castle XML configuration file, but I don't know how to do it using a Web application, since I don't have access to the Console. I think I can use log4net to do it, but after some research using Google, I haven't been able to come up with a solution.

@TITLE:update data from one table to another (in a database)
@CONTENT:DB gurus, I am hoping someone can set set me on the right direction. I have two tables. Table A and Table B. When the system comes up, all entries from Table A are massaged and copied over to Table B (according to Table B's schema). Table A can have tens of thousands of rows. While the system is up, Table B is kept in sync with Table A via DB change notifications. If the system is rebooted, or my service restarted, I want to re-initialize Table B. However, I want to do this with the least possible DB updates. Specifically, I want to: add any rows that are in Table A, but not in Table B, and delete any rows that are not in Table A, but are in Table B any rows that are common to Table A and Table B should be left untouched Now, I am not a "DB guy", so I am wondering what is conventional way of doing this.

@CONTENT:I'm noticing a strange thing with Alarms on Android - they don't always wake up the device at the correct intervals. For example, if I set an alarm to start a service every 5 minutes (using RTC_WAKEUP, or similar), everything works fine until the device goes to sleep - after that, the alarm may not fire for minutes, or close to an hour. It usually does fire eventually - and it always fires if I wake the device by pressing Menu. Using repeating alarms (vs. re-setting them each time) has the same effect. So my question is, are alarms guaranteed to fire at proper intervals when the device is asleep? I understand that I shouldn't expect millisecond or second precision, but tens of minutes?

@TITLE:asp.net mvc and linq to entities: how to include text value from IEnumerable<SelectListItem>
@CONTENT:I have a table with a constraint on one field - it can be 1, 2 or 3. (The correct solution to this is probably to create a lookup table for this, but for now I'm wondering if it's possible to do this without the lookup table.) I've created a class that returns an IEnumerable for the values. I'm using LINQ to Entities, and would like to be able to display the text value in a col. when listing all the entities. The code for create/edit looks like: Controller.cs:     ViewData["Message_Types"] = MessageTypes.MessageTypeList;
 edit.aspx:   <%= Html.DropDownList("Message_Type",(IEnumerable<SelectListItem>)ViewData["Message_Types"]) %>
 and the default model binding works just fine using TryModelUpdate: [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Edit(int id, FormCollection form)
{
   ...
  TryUpdateModel(editItem, new string[] { "Message_Type" });
   ...
}
 How However, I'd like to display the text value instead of the numeric value: index.aspx:   <td>
    <%= Html.Encode(item.Message_Type) %>
  </td>
 How can I get the text value of the element that corresponds to the item.Message_type? Update: The message types look like: public static IEnumerable<SelectListItem> MessageTypeList
{
  get
  {
    return new[] {
      new SelectListItem{ Text = "Text Value 1", Value="1" },
      new SelectListItem{ Text = "Text Value 2", Value="2" },
      new SelectListItem{ Text = "Text Value 3", Value="3" }
    };
  }

}
@CODE:ViewData["Message_Types"] = MessageTypes.MessageTypeList; <%= Html.DropDownList("Message_Type",(IEnumerable<SelectListItem>)ViewData["Message_Types"]) %> [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Edit(int id, FormCollection form)
{

Database In the database, Product has a foreign key for category. Scenario User edits this Product (via a web interface) and chooses a different category (say instead of "Fish" we select "Veg"). This is probably a dropdown list, with each category shown. When they choose a different category we get an int key. Problem Obviously we now want to save the changes to Product but in effect the only change is to save a new int (say 2, instead of 1). So we retrieve the existing Product, and now comes the problem. We don't have a "CategoryID" field on Product, we only have a Category property. But we don't really want to retrieve the category (by id) just to assign it to the Product. So I guess what I want to know is should we... a) Add a CategoryID property to Product b) Create a new category, assign it the relevant id and attach that to Product (but surely that will cause errors, or overwrite the existing category) c) Retrieve (lookup) the category from the system (by id) and attach that to the Product d) Do something else entirely!

@TITLE:bison shift instead of reduce. With reduce/reduce errors
@CONTENT:In my language i can write a = 1

b = 2
if true { } else { }
if true { } **Here is the problem**
else {}
 My grammer doesnt support newlines between statements. An else can only be used with an if. When i add optionalNL in my rule IfExpr:
  IF rval optionalNL codeBlock optionalNL ELSE codeBlock
| IF rval optionalNL codeBlock
 The optionalNL before the else causes 3 reduce/reduce. Reason is it can reduce using the 2nd rule in IfExpr or reduce to exprLoop where it allows many newlines between expressions. No matter what i do (i tried writing %prec before optionalNL and ELSE) it always reduces to exprLoop which cases bison to give me a synax error on else. How do i tell bison to shift at this point (to optionalNL else) instead of reduce? (to exprLoop causing else to be an error). example file to test with %%
program:
      exprLoop;
exprLoop:
      exprLoop2 expr
    | exprLoop2
exprLoop2:
    | exprLoop2 expr EOS
    | exprLoop2 EOS

EOS: '\n'   ;
Var: 'v';
optEOS: | optEOS EOS

%%

//this can be added to the lex file
[iev]   				{ return *yytext; }
 y.output http://www.pastie.org/707448 Alternative .y and output. You can see it looking ahead seeing a \n and doesnt know to reduce the rule or keep going. I change change the order of the rules to get different results. But it either always expects a \n or always expects an else thus one rule always end up being ignore. state 15     9 expr: 'i' Var optEOS '{' '}' .  [$end, '\n']
   10     | 'i' Var optEOS '{' '}' . 'e' '{' '}'

@TITLE:Nhibernate ICriteria and Using Lambda Expressions in queries
@CONTENT:hi i am new in NHibernate and i am a little confused. Suppose we have a product table. Let the product table have 2 columns price1 and price2. then i may query mapped product entities via HQL as follows: string queryString = @"from product p
where p.price1 = p.price2 + 100 ";
IList result = session.CreateQuery(queryString).List();
 How can i achieve that via ICriteria API. i know it's absurd but i am trying sth like that: session.CreateCriteria(typeof(product))
   .Add(Expression.Eq("price1", "price2" + 100))
   .List()
 or more appropriately sth like that (using lambda extensions): session.CreateCriteria(typeof(product))
   .Add<product>(p => p.price1 == (p.price2 + 100))
   .List()
 in fact i downloaded lambda extensions project from googlecode and i extended it to recusively process Binary and Unary expressions to implement expresssions like: session.CreateCriteria(typeof(product))
   .Add<product>(p => 
               (!(p.price1 > 29007) && (p.price1 > 19009)) 
            || (p.price2 == 29009));
 i am currently processing queries like above but the arithmethic clauses are annoying me since i can't return the appropriate Restriction to obtain the Criterion i need. mpffh i m tired of trying to explain it in a comprehensive way. i hope it worked. Any help is appreciated.
@CODE:string queryString = @"from product p
where p.price1 = p.price2 + 100 ";

@TITLE:Request.IsAjaxRequest returning false on POST
@CONTENT:My question is similar to this one and I am having a similar issue, but a big difference is that I'm using the Ajax helper methods (Ajax.ActionLink and Ajax.BeginForm) instead of handling the AJAX with jQuery. Request.IsAjaxRequest() is returning true for the Edit method that accepts http GET, but false for Edit method accepting http POST. The GET request comes from a link generated by: <%=Ajax.ActionLink(item.Name, "Edit", "Device",
     new { id = item.ID },
     new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod= "GET", UpdateTargetId = "ModalDialog" },
     new { name = item.Name })%>
 The POST request comes from a form generated by this code: <% using (Ajax.BeginForm("Edit", "Device", new { id = Model.ID }, new AjaxOptions { OnComplete = "CloseDialog" }))
{ %>
    <fieldset>
         <h4>
            <label for="Name">Name</label>
        </h4>
        <%= Html.TextBox("Name", null, new { @class = "required" })%>

        <h4>
            <input type="checkbox" id="IsActive" name="IsActive" <% if (Model.IsActive)%> <%=Html.Encode("checked=''")%> />
            <label for="IsActive">Unit Is Active</label>

        <p>
            <input type="submit" value="Save" />

 Is this by design, am I doing something wrong, and how do I fix this?

@TITLE:Json results prompting ¡§Save As¡¨ dialog in browser instead of being processed. ASP.NET MVC
@CONTENT:I know this has been an issue for others, but I've yet to find anything that fixes my problem. I have a partial view that is displayed in a lightbox (colorbox). It is a simple form. I want the form to submit and return a little bit of data. The data will be used in calling subsequent functions, and I want the main DIV just to be updated with a "success" message. Here is the full code of the partial view: <%@ Control Language="C#" Inherits="System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl<Solution2.Models.Category>" %>

            success: function(data) { document.getElementById('main1').innerHTML = "Success"; },
            failure: function() { document.getElementById('main1').innerHTML = "Failure"; }
        })
    });
    </script>

            </p>
        </fieldset>

    <% } %>
 Here is my controller code. The code works, in that it successfully adds the form data to the table/database. What exactly should my "return" line look like? [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
        public JsonResult Create(Category propcat)
        {

            Category resultcat = new Category();
            _db.Categories.InsertOnSubmit(propcat);
            _db.SubmitChanges();
            resultcat = propcat;
            return Json(new { CatID = resultcat.CatID, CatTitle = resultcat.CatTitle, message = "Category successfully created!" });
        }
 Currently I'm not actually using any of the result data in my partial view code (even though I reference it in my "success" parameter). I'm just trying to get it to work (and not prompt me to save the results). Thanks.

@CONTENT:I'm starting out with MVVM, and I'm starting to understand things. I'm currently experimenting with the Cinch framework, though I'm not committed to it as of yet. I was injecting the ViewModels into the Views using by having a reference to the ViewModel in the codebehind of the view, with the property having a [Dependency] on it, and in the setter it sets the DataContext to the right view, using Unity. Neat trick, I thought. I'm trying to get my app to work as a single Window, with injected views (As opposed to multiple windows and dealing with opening\closing them) I changed my views from Windows to UserControls, and added a to the main window. That worked, but the ViewModel was never injected, presumably because the XAML doesn't use Container.Resolve to create the view, as when I created the view and added it manually in the code-behind using Resolve, the [Dependency] was created. How can I set up my window, so that if I add a view through XAML, or the view gets changed as a result of a UI action etc, it gets it through Unity, so that it can work its magic?

Unfortunately, a simple SWIG hello world (which also compiles - but not so easily) crashes with Segmentation Fault or Illegal Instruction (depending on some details of the compilation/linker process).

ld -G -b64 -berok -bnoentry -bexpall -brtl example.o example_wrap.o -o _example.so
 The linker step is the problematic one. If you follow the examples on the tutorial, you should do ld -bshared example.o example_wrap.o -o _example.so #the b is not a typo, but a different syntax in AIX vd GNU ld
 Unfortunately this does not work for several reasons. I believe that IBM/AIX and the Open Source communities have quite a different thoughts on what "shared library" means. The most common shared objects (so) that you get from the AIX native linker have no symbols at all in them (and are in fact less than 1kB in size). It's also pretty easy to get broken output from the linker (in such a case a quite long list of unresolved symbols like the following appears while linking): ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: PyType_Type
 Doing what one is supposed to do, it seems clear that the solution is hacking with the various linker options, -berok, -bnoentry, -bexpall, -brtl, -bshared, -bM:SRE, -bexpfull. In fact, it is possible to find some combinations which create a non-empty .so library, without generating errors. One of these combinations is reported in the Makefile snippet above (there are others). Unfortunately, all of them fail in one of the following two modes! $ python -c "import example"
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
 or $ python -c "import example"
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
 Using the gcc, or a different version of python (we have 7!) either 32 bit or 64 bit does not change anything: you can find a "good" link option, but it crashes at runtime. How to solve this?

@LINK:/questions/1716472/using-libtool-to-load-a-duplicate-function-name-from-a-shared-library
@TITLE:Using libtool to load a duplicate function name from a shared library
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a 'debug' shared library (i.e., .so or .dll file) that calls another 'real' shared library that has the same C API as the debug library (in this case, to emulate the PKCS#11 API). However, I'm running into trouble where the link map of the debug library is colliding with that of the real library and causing the debug library to call its own functions instead of the corresponding functions in the real library. I found a solution to this problem by using the POSIX dlmopen command, but would like to understand if the same is possible using GNU's libtool. On my Solaris 10 system, the following code fails the assertion when a test application statically links to the debug library: #include <dlfcn.h>
int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlopen("realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // Fails
  return (*function_ptr)();
}
 In this case, I get a function pointer to the local 'MyFunctionName' (in the debug library) instead of MyFunctionName within the real shared library. I've discovered that it's possible to get around this problem by using the command 'dlmopen' instead of 'dlopen', and telling dlmopen to create a new link map (with the LM_ID_NEWLM parameter) when loading the real library: int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlmopen(LM_ID_NEWLM, "realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // succeeds
  return function_ptr(); // call real function
}
 Unfortunately, dlmopen does not seem to be included within libtool (i.e., I don't see an lt_dlmopen function in libtool). Is it possible to do the same thing using libtool commands -- that is, to create a new link map when loading the new library so that it doesn't collide with the link map of the debug library?
@CODE:#include <dlfcn.h>
int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlopen("realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // Fails
  return (*function_ptr)();
} LM_ID_NEWLM int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlmopen(LM_ID_NEWLM, "realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");

@CONTENT:Suppose I'm writing (assembly) code for a CPU whose only atomic operation is an unconditional swap -- no LL/SC, no compare-and-swap, just plain swap. (An ARM9 would be an example of such a beast.) Is there a way to perform atomic increment/decrement operations using the swap operation? There is a relatively easy answer, which is to use the swap to build a spinlock, and use that to provide a critical section around ordinary increment and decrement. But that seems clunky, and I know it can be done without a lock if CAS or LL/SC are available. So what I'm really wondering is if there's a way to do it without using a lock.

@TITLE:Jquery validate date range fails
@CONTENT:I have an HTML page with a web form. Among other things, it includes the following form fields: Title - textbox SourceName - textbox Url - textbox FullText - textbox PublicationDate - textbox using jQuery datepicker UI StartDate - textbox using jQuery datepicker UI EndDate - textbox using jQuery datepicker UI I am trying to implement the jQuery validator multiple field sample: jQuery(document).ready(function() {
// a custom method for validating the date range
jQuery.validator.addMethod("dateRange", function() {
    var date1 = new Date(jQuery("#StartDate").val());
    var date2 = new Date(jQuery("#EndDate").val());
    return (date1 < date2);
}, "Please check your dates. The start date must be before the end date.");

// a new class rule to group all three methods
jQuery.validator.addClassRules({
    requiredDateRange: { required: true, date: true, dateRange: true }
});

// overwrite default messages
jQuery.extend(jQuery.validator.messages, {
    required: "These fields are required",
    date: "Please specify valid dates"
});

jQuery("#mainForm").validate({ 
    submitHandler: function() {
        alert("Valid date range.")
    },
    groups: {
        dateRange: "StartDate EndDate"
    },
    rules: {
        "Title": "required",
        "SourceName": "required",
        "Url": "required",
        "FullText": "required",
        "PublicationDate": "required",

    }
});

 }); It validates all but the date range. I tried doing this a little more custom, but explicitly creating the Date objects prior to the return statement (in the demo, it's all on one line), but this did no good. Does anyone have experience making this actually work? EDIT: I added a line to pop up an alert message when the dateRange method is called, but it never shows up. I wonder if the groups and rules parts of the validator just don't work together.

@TITLE:CMake: how to add compiler flags to non-default compiler
@CONTENT:Hello I want to build a project with intel compiler. With default gcc I usually run: cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/some/path  /path/to/project
 And this works fine. cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/some/path  /path/to/project
 When I try to use non-default compiler it does not path CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variable content to compiler at all. How to fix this? Correct Answer is: You need to specify the type of the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variable: -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-I/some/path
 You need to provide full path to C and C++ compilers: cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/intel/bin/icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/intel/bin/icpc -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-some-flag

@CONTENT:I am just wondering what is the best way to make custom print error functions. For example I have some #defines like this in header file: #define SOCKET_ERR 0
#define BIND_ERR   1
#define LISTEN_ERR 2 
etc
 Then maybe using this like this: if(/*something has gone wrong with socket*/)
{
   print_error(SOCKET_ERR);
}

print_error(int error)
{
   if(error == 0)
   {
       printf("Socket failure\n");
   }
}
 However, I don't think this perfect and want to do something much better. Maybe something a little bit more professional and maybe more scalable. Many thanks for any advice,

@LINK:/questions/1716472/using-libtool-to-load-a-duplicate-function-name-from-a-shared-library
@TITLE:Using libtool to load a duplicate function name from a shared library
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a 'debug' shared library (i.e., .so or .dll file) that calls another 'real' shared library that has the same C API as the debug library (in this case, to emulate the PKCS#11 API). However, I'm running into trouble where the link map of the debug library is colliding with that of the real library and causing the debug library to call its own functions instead of the corresponding functions in the real library. I found a solution to this problem by using the POSIX dlmopen command, but would like to understand if the same is possible using GNU's libtool. On my Solaris 10 system, the following code fails the assertion when a test application statically links to the debug library: #include <dlfcn.h>
int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlopen("realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // Fails
  return (*function_ptr)();
}
 In this case, I get a function pointer to the local 'MyFunctionName' (in the debug library) instead of MyFunctionName within the real shared library. I've discovered that it's possible to get around this problem by using the command 'dlmopen' instead of 'dlopen', and telling dlmopen to create a new link map (with the LM_ID_NEWLM parameter) when loading the real library: int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlmopen(LM_ID_NEWLM, "realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // succeeds
  return function_ptr(); // call real function
}
 Unfortunately, dlmopen does not seem to be included within libtool (i.e., I don't see an lt_dlmopen function in libtool). Is it possible to do the same thing using libtool commands -- that is, to create a new link map when loading the new library so that it doesn't collide with the link map of the debug library?
@CODE:#include <dlfcn.h>
int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlopen("realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // Fails
  return (*function_ptr)();
} LM_ID_NEWLM int MyFunctionName() {
  int (*function_ptr)();
  void *handle = dlmopen(LM_ID_NEWLM, "realsharedlibrary.so", RTDL_LAZY);
  *(void **)(&function_ptr) = dlsym(handle, "MyFunctionName");
  ASSERT(function_ptr != MyFunctionName); // succeeds
  return function_ptr(); // call real function
}

@TITLE:Implement atomic increment using atomic swap?
@CONTENT:Suppose I'm writing (assembly) code for a CPU whose only atomic operation is an unconditional swap -- no LL/SC, no compare-and-swap, just plain swap. (An ARM9 would be an example of such a beast.) Is there a way to perform atomic increment/decrement operations using the swap operation? There is a relatively easy answer, which is to use the swap to build a spinlock, and use that to provide a critical section around ordinary increment and decrement. But that seems clunky, and I know it can be done without a lock if CAS or LL/SC are available. So what I'm really wondering is if there's a way to do it without using a lock.

 What I wanted to achieve is to delete all instances of PBCPDF except for the first one, which I could write the substitution command as :.+1,$s/PBCPDF\n//g. However, since I wanted to program a macro to process multiple fund names, I need a means to use some sort of pattern that would retrieve the current line as the search pattern without me doing it by hand. Is there a way to do that?

@TITLE:Why do I have to re-install MSMQ when I come off and back on to the office network?
@CONTENT:I've got a really frustrating problem with MSMQ constantly refusing to work even though it's installed and started. I have MSMQ installed on my Vista Business laptop (MSMQ-Container;MSMQ-Server;MSMQ-Triggers;MSMQ-DCOMProxy) and this laptop is joined to the company domain. Registry shows that it's installed under Workgroup mode which is fine by me as I only want to use direct connections to private queues (using a full FormatName (TCP based)) and could care less about AD integration. When plugged into the office network all is well. When I unplug and go home to work, MSMQ appears to be running (the service still runs) but all my attempts to connect to a queue fail with a "Service is Unavailable" exception. Tried with my .NET app, COM, QueueExplorer app and all say the same. Also the MSMQ stuff in Computer Management is gone. The only way to get it back and working at home is to uninstall everything, and re-install it. Then when I get to the office, I have to uninstall MSMQ and re-install for it to work when plugged into the office network! Anyone got any ideas? I had a thought that maybe this has something to do with NICs and IP addresses changing etc? MSMQ seems to be really flakey at the moment. Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have a upload text file field, and with it I plan to save the file somewhere and then store the location of the file in a database. However, I want to make sure the file they uploaded is a .txt file, and not, say, an image file. I imagine this happens in the validation step. How does one validate such a thing? Also, how do you get the filename of the uploaded file? I could always just check if it said '.txt' but for future reference knowing how to validate without just the filename would be helpful.

 }); It validates all but the date range.

@TITLE:CMake: how to add compiler flags to non-default compiler
@CONTENT:Hello I want to build a project with intel compiler. With default gcc I usually run: cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/some/path  /path/to/project
 And this works fine. cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/some/path  /path/to/project
 When I try to use non-default compiler it does not path CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variable content to compiler at all. How to fix this? Correct Answer is: You need to specify the type of the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variable: -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-I/some/path
 You need to provide full path to C and C++ compilers: cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/intel/bin/icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/intel/bin/icpc -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-some-flag

 Then maybe using this like this: if(/*something has gone wrong with socket*/)
{
   print_error(SOCKET_ERR);
}

print_error(int error)
{
   if(error == 0)
   {
       printf("Socket failure\n");

 However, I don't think this perfect and want to do something much better. Maybe something a little bit more professional and maybe more scalable. Many thanks for any advice,

@CONTENT:I'm making a sample GUI for a new application we are developing at work. The language has already been decided for me, but I am allowed to use any 3rd party DLLs or add-ins or whatever I need in order to make the GUI work as seamlessly as possible. They want it very mac/ubuntu/vista/Windows 7-like, so I've come up with some very interesting controls and pretty GUI features. One of which are some growing/shrinking buttons near the top of the screen that increase in size when you mouse over them (it uses the distance formula to calculate the size it needs to increase by). When you take your mouse off of the controls, they shrink back down. The effect looks very professional and flashy, except that there is a ghosting effect as the button shrinks back down (and the buttons to the right of it since they are fixed-at-the-hip). Here is what the buttons look like in the designer: Here are some code snippets that I am using to do this: pops child buttons underneath when parent is hovered Private Sub buttonPop(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)

 What I know: If the form didn't have a background image, I wouldn't have the ghosting problem. If this were just a normal button I am drawing, I probably wouldn't have the ghosting problem. What I've done, and how I've tried to fix it: Ensuring the form's doublebuffering is turned on (it was) Manually doublebuffering using the bufferedGraphics class (did not help or made it worse) Convince the designers that it doesn't need background images or the pretty glass buttons (no go) Run Invalidate() on the rectangle containing the form (did not help) Run Refresh() on the form (fixed the ghosting, but now the entire screen flashes as it reloads image) Sit in the corner of my cubicle and cry softly to myself (helped the stress, but also did not fix issue) What I am looking for are the answers to these questions: Does anyone have any idea how to get rid of the ghosting I'm describing? Should I focus on changing the size less often? should I be focusing on buffering the background image? Are there other technologies I should be using here? Are there ActiveX controls that would be better at this than .NET user inherited ones? Is it possible to make a DirectX user-control to use the graphics card to draw itself? Is there something else I'm not thinking of here? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Update 1: 11/17/2009 9:21 AM ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I've improved the efficiency of the draw methods by first checking to see if they need to be redrawn by checking what the new values will be vs what they already are(code changed above). This fixes some of the ghosting, however the core problem still remains to be solved.

@TITLE:Rich text format (with formatting tags) in Excel to unformatted text
@CONTENT:I have approx. 12000 cells in excel containing RTF (including formatting tags). I need to parse them to get to the unformatted text. This is the example of one of the cells with text: {\rtf1\ansi\deflang1060\ftnbj\uc1
{\fonttbl{\f0 \froman \fcharset0 Times New Roman;}{\f1 \fswiss \fcharset238
Arial;}}

 And all I really need is this: TPR 0160 000
IPR 0160 000
OB-R-02-28
 The problem with simple looping over the cells and removing unnecessary formatting is, that not everything in those 12000 cells is as straightforward as this is. So I would need to manually inspect many different versions and write several variations; and still at the end there would be a lot of manual work to do. But if I copy the contents of one cell to empty text document and save it as RTF, then open it with MS Word, it instantly parses the text and I get exactly what I want. Unfortunately it's extremely inconvenient to do so for a 12000 cells. So I was thinking about VBA macro, to move cell contents to Word, force parsing and then copy the result back to the originating cell. Unfortunately I'm not really sure how to do it. Does anybody has any idea? Or a different approach? I will be really grateful for a solution or a push in the right direction. TNX!

@TITLE:How to marshal a DataHandler annotated as @XmlAttachmentRef with JAXB?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to marshal an object which has a DataHandler field with JAXB (2.1.12). For streaming support, the DataHandler is annotated with @XmlAttachmentRef. Serialization and streaming over web services (Metro on JBoss) work fine, but plain marshalling with JAXB doesn't. Here is a stripped down example: public class DataHandlerAttachmentSerialization {

    @XmlRootElement
    static class RootObject {
        @XmlElement
        @XmlAttachmentRef // Works without this, but required for streaming 
        DataHandler dataHandler = new DataHandler(
                new com.sun.xml.ws.util.ByteArrayDataSource(
                " ".getBytes(), "application/octet-stream"));
    }

    @Test
    public void test() throws JAXBException {
        JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(RootObject.class);
        Marshaller marshaller = context.createMarshaller();
        StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
        marshaller.marshal(new RootObject(), writer);
        Assert.assertNotNull(writer.toString());
    }
}

 Line 80 in SwaRefAdapter is return am.addSwaRefAttachment(data); and am was assigned with AttachmentMarshaller am = XMLSerializer.getInstance().attachmentMarshaller; so it seems attachmentMarshaller is null at this point if the @XmlAttachmentRef is present. Do I need to set up something differently, or use the JAXB API in a different way to handle attachments?

@CONTENT:I need to write a query that returns all object less that or equal to a certain day of a certain month. The year is not important.

@TITLE:Delphi: how to use TObjectList<T>?
@CONTENT:I need to understand how to use the generic Delphi 2009 TObjectList. My non-TObjectList attempt looked like TSomeClass = class(TObject)
private

public
  procedure FillArray(var List: Array of TList1; Source: TSource); Overload;
  procedure FillArray(var List: Array of TList2; Source: TSource); Overload;
end;
 Here, TList1 and TList2 inherits the same constructor constructor TParent.Create(Key: string; Value: string);. However, due to different specialization (e.g. different private fields), they will not be of the same type. So I have to write two nearly identical fill methods: procedure TSomeClass.FillArray(var List: Array of TList1; Source: TSource);
begin
  for i := 0 to Source.List1.Count - 1 do begin
    SetLength(List, Length(List) + 1);
    List[i] := TList1.Create(Source.List1[i].Key, Source.List1[i].Value);
  end;
end;
 with FillArray(List: Array of TList2; Source: TSource); being identical, except for the replacement of TList1 with TList2 throughout. As far as I understand, this could be neatly circumvented by using TObjectList and a single fill method; yet, I don't have a clue how to go about this. Do anyone have some good pointers on this? Thanks!

WHERE t1.date > SOMEDATE
 From my understanding it will run the where statement and get only the results that fall within the date range. Then it will go through all of t2 and only try to match ids that connect to t1 (which may make the results smaller). Then with this smaller potential results it will do the same for T3 and output the final results. But it appears that is NOT how this works? And the tables multiply instead of getting smaller. And apparently what i am describing above is more like subqueries? (NOTE that i said LIKE. I dont know how subquerys work) How does JOIN work and what is the difference between a JOIN and a subquery? I use both MySql and SQLite. I dont know if thats relevant.

@TITLE:How to design a REStful API for a media analysis engine
@CONTENT:I am new to Restful concept and have to design a simple API for a media analysis service I need to set up, to perform various tasks, e.g. face analysis, region detection, etc. on uploaded images and video. Outline of my initial design is as follows: Client POSTs a configuration XML file to http://manalysis.com/facerecognition. This creates a profile that can be used for multiple analysis sessions. Response XML includes a ProfileID to refer to this profile. Clients can skip this step to use the default config parameters Client POSTs video data to be analyzed to http://manalysis.com/facerecognition (with ProfileID as a parameter, if it's set up). This creates an analysis session. Return XML has the SessionID. Client can send a GET to http://manalysis.com/facerecognition/SessionID to receive the status of the session. Am I on the right track? Specifically, I have the following questions: Should I include facerecognition in the URL? Roy Fielding says that "a REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies" Is this an instance of that mistake? The analysis results can either be returned to the client in one large XML file or when each event is detected. How should I tell the analysis engine where to return the results? Should I explicitly delete a profile when analysis is done, through a DELETE call? Thanks, C

@TITLE:Local branches with Bazaar?
@CONTENT:I've been playing around with Git recently to get a grasp of distributed version control. Now I'm looking at Bazaar, but can't figure out how to make a local branch, i.e. a branch that I do not have to push to when I want to commit changes. With Git, I would do git branch branch_name or git checkout -b branch_name I can then work in my local branch, committing changes as I go, without having to push changes to a remote repo. When I'm through with the branch, I can merge it to my local master branch. If I want, I can then push those changes to the remote repo. Is this possible with Bazaar? Bazaar seems much more like SVN, with branches just being separate directories, so maybe not.

@TITLE:Generate a row per minute of the day from a sparsely populated database table
@CONTENT:I have a table populated with time stamped rows inserted at (essentially) random point in the day. I need to generate running totals with 1 row per minute (so for a single day there will always be exactly 24 * 60 rows) e.g. Date                Quantity    Running Total
2009-10-29 06:30           1                1

2009-10-29 06:34           22              49
 ... ... Any thoughts on the best way to do this? One SQL query would be ideal but not essential, performance is fairly important (sub 5 seconds on a table containg 500k rows of which 70k are interesting to this query) My Final Solution (more or less). The actual scenario was this. I have two tables one containing Orders with a 1:n relationship to a Fills table. I needed to show the running Average Price and Cumulative Total for each minute in the trading day DECLARE @StartDate AS DATETIME, @EndDate AS DATETIME
SET @StartDate = '2009-10-28';
SET @EndDate = '2009-10-29';

-- Generate a Temp Table containing all the dates I'm interested in
WITH DateIntervalsCTE AS
(
 SELECT 0 i, @StartDate AS Date
 UNION ALL
 SELECT i + 1, DATEADD(minute, i, @StartDate )
 FROM DateIntervalsCTE 
 WHERE DATEADD(minute, i, @StartDate ) < @EndDate
)
SELECT DISTINCT Date 
INTO #Dates
FROM DateIntervalsCTE
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 32767);

SELECT 
 d.Date
 , mo3.symbol
 , ISNULL(SUM(mf.Quantity),0) AS CumulativeTotal
 , ROUND(ISNULL(SUM(mf.Quantity * mf.Price)/SUM(mf.Quantity),0),4) AS AveragePrice
FROM 
 #Dates AS d
 CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT mo2.Symbol, mo2.OrderID 
    FROM 
     Orders AS mo2 
     INNER JOIN Fills AS mf2 ON mo2.OrderID = mf2.OrderID
    WHERE CONVERT(DATETIME,CONVERT(CHAR(10),mf2.FillDate,101)) = @StartDate
    ) AS mo3
 LEFT JOIN Fills AS mf ON mo3.OrderID = mf.OrderID AND CONVERT(DATETIME,CONVERT(CHAR(16),mf.FillDate,120)) < = d.Date
WHERE
 d.Date >= DATEADD(mi,390, @StartDate) -- 06:30
 AND d.Date <= DATEADD(mi,780, @StartDate) -- 13:00
GROUP BY d.Date, mo3.symbol
ORDER BY mo3.Symbol, d.Date
 I still haven't completed all my testing but this looks like it does the trick, thanks for the assistance!

@TITLE:Firing a COM Event From Another Thread
@CONTENT:I have created an in-process COM object (DLL) using ATL. Note that this is an object and not a control (so has no window or user-interface.) My problem is that I am trying to fire an event from a second thread and I am getting a 'Catastrophic failure' (0x8000FFFF). If I fire the event from my main thread, then I don't get the error. The second thread is calling CoInitializeEx but this makes no difference. I am using the Apartment threading model but switching to Free Threaded doesn't help. The fact I am trying to do this from a second thread is obviously crucial. Is there an easy way to do this or am I going to have to implement some hidden-window form of messaging? For example, in my main object's source file: STDMETHODIMP MyObject::SomeMethod(...)
{
  CreateThread(NULL, 0, ThreadProc, this, 0, NULL);
  // Succeeds with S_OK
  FireEvent(L"Hello, world!");
  return S_OK;
}

DWORD WINAPI ThreadProc(LPVOID param)
{
  CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED);
  MyObject* comObject = reinterpret_cast<MyObject*>(param);
  // Fails with 0x8000FFFF
  comObject->FireEvent(L"Hello, world!");
}

void MyObject::FireEvent(BSTR str)
{
  ...
  // Returns 0x8000FFFF if called from ThreadProc
  // Returns S_OK if called from SomeMethod

Have you any suggestions on how we can provide a way for the user to enter his own formulas for this?

@TITLE:SerialPort data loss - C#
@CONTENT:I'm working on a SerialPort app and one very simple part of it is giving me issues. I simply want to read a constant stream of data from the port and write it out to a binary file as it comes in. The problem seems to be speed: my code has worked fine on my 9600 baud test device, but when carried over to the 115200bps live device, I seem to be losing data. What happens is after a variable period of time, I miss 1 byte which throws off the rest of the data. I've tried a few things: private void serialPort1_DataReceived(object sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e)
{
    bwLogger.Write((byte)serialPort1.ReadByte());
}
 or private void serialPort1_DataReceived(object sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e)
{
    byte[] inc = new byte[serialPort1.BytesToRead];
    serialPort1.Read(inc, 0, inc.Length);

    bwLogger.Write(inc);
}
 and a few variations. I can't use ReadLine() as I am working with a constant stream of data (right?). I've tried fiddling with the buffer size (both serialPort1.ReadBufferSize and the hardware FIFO buffer). Ideally, for usability purposes, I'd handle this on the software side and not make the user have to change Windows driver settings. Any ideas?

 It's pretty simple stuff so far (although finding decent documentation as to what you are able to do with the GetListItem SOAP request was daunting). Inside of the block where I iterate through the returned rows (the PprocessResult function), I am resetting the HTML being assigned to the DIV block so that only one row is showing as output. The way the code is set up, this means only the very last row in my custom list will be visible, as I have no code pausing the iterations. My thought had been to wrap a timer around this block of code: $(xData.responseXML).find("z\\:row").each(MYTIMER(10000, function(){...
 But I met with zero or mixed results. My question to you all is: What would be the best way to set up my current code to both refresh the source list data like it is now AND cycle through query results from that list one at a time (preferably with a small pause on each item so that people can read it)? Thank you so much!! Mike

When I copy my website to IIS I am constantly getting this annoying error (after I click Login button): Failed to generate a user instance of SQL Server due to failure in retrieving the user's local application data path. Please make sure the user has a local user profile on the computer. The connection will be closed. I also observed that in my App_Data folder some weird files are being created. To sum up.

@TITLE:Using ASP.Net to launch an application on the SERVER on a specific desktop
@CONTENT:I've got a number of utilities that run on the same machine as my IIS webserver. What I'm trying to do is allow a web page to instantiate an executable. If I use Process.Start() the process launches but obviously as the same user as the webserver so it can't interact with the desktop. For 99% of the apps, this isn't a problem. However, I'd like to be able to run them as if a specific user (only ever me) had launched them. This is more an attempt to see if this is possible than a serious dev project so I'm more interested in the method than the goal. Ideally, if I'm logged on to the box (almost always) then it should just run as if i'd followed a shortcut. If not, launching the app and having it attached to my desktop when I log on would be perfect. If it's not possible before user login, i can accept that. I'm aware of the security considerations but am mitigating them by: Website needs authentication + SSL List of Apps to launch is configured in a file which cannot be modified remotely (or at all by the web user - read only) The box is in a DMZ Worst-case, the machine is relatively unimportant and can be re-imaged easily. I've googled but this seems to be a fairly unusual request so there's not a lot of information except for "Don't think you can do that" - So I thought I'd ask here in the hopes of getting either a) a way to do it or b) a decent explanation of why it can't be done. If it makes it any simpler, put aside the web aspect - How can I launch a process in another users' security context and attached to their desktop (if they have one) Thanks in advance for any help and pointers you can provide.

@TITLE:SidBySide: 3rd Party Dll refers to two versions of MSVCR80.DLL
@CONTENT:We include a 3rd Party lib+DLL that recently causes a lot of trouble on installations. Using dependencywalker, we found that the dll itself refers to two different Versions of MSVCR80.DLL:
Version 8.0.50727.4053 and
Version 8.0.50727.42
 In MOST cases installation makes no problems, even if we distribute none of both versions. But in a number of cases our installation just does not start. We then find messages in the windows system event log from the SideBySide manger: "Version of DLL does not match". In most cases again this problem can be resolved, by installing the .NET framework (although we do not use this). But now we have a case where this does not help. I know that a solution would be, to install both versions as a shared assembly, but that seems not to be easy, and besides that i would prefer a much simpler solution. Does anybody know a workaround? Can i somehow use only one version of the Dll? EDIT: I now tried cristians advice: D:\Develop\LEADTOOLS15\patch_maifest>mt.exe -inputresource:ltkrn15u.dll;#1 -out:old.manifest

 If i view the dlls dependencies with full paths, i see the following: The lower MSVCR80.DLL is the one withe Version ...42. I dont understand this. Why does MSVC**P**80.DLL refer to a different Version of MSVC**R**80.DLL than the one besides it. Is that maybe a problem of the dependencywalker ?

@TITLE:Conditionally change C statements in C source file
@CONTENT:I have a C file in which we are moving the logging infrastructure. So if ( logging_level >= LEVEL_FINE )
  printf("Value at %p is %d\n", p, i);
 becomes do_log2(LEVEL_FINE, "Value at %p is %d\n", _ptr(p), _num(i));
 do_log2 means log with 2 arguments. So I need a C parsing and modification infrastructure to do this. Which tool can I use to accomplish this most easily ? Note: the printf can also appear in the file as : if ( logging_level >= LEVEL_FINE )
{
  printf("Value at %p is %d\n", 
  p, 
  i);

@TITLE:Detecting Download in UIWebView
@CONTENT:I have a programatically crated UIWebView, and it is used to browse a iPhone-style site stored on my server. In this website, there are a few links to files users can download into my application. Right now, I'm trying to detect this with: - (BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *) webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *) request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType) navigationType
{
    url = [request URL];
    NSString *mimeType = [request valueForHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"];
    NSLog(@"Content-type: %@", mimeType);
    if(mimeType == @"application/zip" || mimeType == @"application/x-zip" || mimeType == @"application/octet-stream")

    	[NSThread detachNewThreadSelector:@selector(download:) toTarget:self withObject:@"/tmp/file.ipa"];
    	return NO;
    }
    return YES;
}
 However, when this method is called, the content-type header is almost always (null), so I never am able to download a file. How would you do this correctly?

@TITLE:Handle exceptions with WPF and MVVM
@CONTENT:I am attempting to build an application using WPF and the MVVM pattern. I have my Views being populated from my ViewModel purely through databinding. I want to have a central place to handle all exceptions which occur in my application so I can notify the user and log the error appropriately. I know about Dispatcher.UnhandledException but this does not do the job as exception that occur during databinding are logged to the output windows. Because my View is databound to my ViewModel the entire application is pretty much controlled via databinding so I have no way to log my errors. Is there a way to generically handle the exceptions raised during databinding, without having to put try blocks around all my ViewModel public's? Example View: <Window x:Class="Test.TestView"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"

    <StackPanel VerticalAlignment="Center">
        <Label Visibility="{Binding DisplayLabel, Converter={StaticResource BooleanToVisibilityConverter}}">My Label</Label>
    </StackPanel>
</Window>
 The ViewModel: public class TestViewModel
{
    public bool DisplayLabel
    {
        get { throw new NotImplementedException(); }
    }
}
 It is an internal application so I do not want to use Wer as I have seen previously recommended.

@TITLE:css layout for footer at bottom with dynamic ajax content changing height of page
@CONTENT:[Update] I actually compromised on this problem for now by foregoing the fixed footer design. It seems that there is no problem with dynamic content moving the footer and resizing containers appropriately unless the footer is fixed to the browser bottom initially. I hope others will eventually provide a great solution that encompasses the best of both worlds. I spent all day trying to get the footer to move down the page to accommodate dynamically added (via ajax) content. I really need some pointers or links because I haven't found anything that helps. Basically: My site has some pages that begin with only a text box and a button so that the total height of the content area is only a few inches beneath the header area. I don't have any problem getting the sticky footer working so that the footer appears at the bottom of the browser window even when there is very little content on screen. That same css layout works fine for other pages that have content that extends beneath the browser window. The catch: The content has to be rendered and passed to the browser with the initial load. The Problem: Any content that is added to the page via AJAX after the initial load paints down the page correctly -- but the footer remains in its initial location. Please tell me there is a fix for this. I can't post the css until checking with my boss first - if possible - and if needed, I will later - but it's just a very basic version of the many sticky footer css solutions floating around the web. Thanks.

@TITLE:Animating UIButton images
@CONTENT:I'd like to give a UIButton in my app a continuous "pulsing" effect where it animates through a series of images and then reverses back through these same images. I've found examples of UIImageViews using their animationImages property, but all I've found for UIButtons is animating changing their alpha. The UIView method setAnimationRepeatAutoreverses is what I want for the looping, but I don't understand how to use an array of images within an animation block for a UIButton. Is this possible or is a NSTimer/setImage approach recommended? Any examples are much appreciated.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC in a subfolder (only) on godaddy [closed]
@CONTENT:Okay, I have read many of the routing posts concerning putting asp.net mvc on godaddy. However, I have not come to a solution to my current problem. I am trying to publish an ASP.NET MVC application to a subfolder on godaddy. I have upgraded the account to use IIS 7 and I have included the MVC dlls in \bin\ deployment method. However, I suspect that my route is not correct. Currently, my routes are set up with the standard out of the box route: public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
    routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

    routes.MapRoute(
        "Default",                                              // Route name
        "{controller}/{action}/{id}",                           // URL with parameters
        new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" }  // Parameter defaults
    );

}
 I have a subdomain set up so that it looks like office.domain.com. The subdomain is pointing at a folder "/office/" which is right off the root folder. (There is not an MVC application installed in the root folder). All of my application has been placed in this 'office' folder. When I hover over the links however, the 'office' portion shows up in the link as well. e.g. Hovering over a link to the customer controller, index action yields "office.domain.com/office/Customer" as the target. This link then gets a 404 when I attempt to go to it. What should my route be to fix this? Is there something I have neglected in setting up the subdomain in godaddy? Is this something I just can't do in godaddy's domain management "tool". Do I need to set up a virtual directory for this instead of just a directory? Update: I changed the IIS settings in godaddy to use integrated pipeline mode, per this discussion and I am no longer getting 404 errors. The application worked just fine as suggested it would.
@CODE:public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)

@TITLE:Prompt for login details when using Integrated Windows Authentication
@CONTENT:For an ASP.NET application, how can I prompt the user for their username / password when Integrated Windows Authentication is used? I would like to use C# in the code behind of the pages to do this. I want some pages (e.g. http://intranet/admin/) to prompt for a password, while others automatically go though (via IWA/NTLM). I would then like it to remember that the user has logged in as they visit other pages in the folder / site and offer a logout link for when they are finished. Edit: What I want to do is send a 401 status and WWW-Authentication headers to the user, so they then log in using their Windows Credentials. Basically, how Firefox / IE do it if the site isn't trusted. Edit 2: SharePoint does this kind of thing, where you automatically log in, but can log out and log in as someone else without needing to log out of Windows. Edit 3: An example (other than SharePoint): You are logged in as a standard (limited access) Windows / Active Directory user to a trusted site, which passes on your credentials. You then want to log into an admin part of the site with different credentials (but still Windows, not WebForms). The only other way of doing it is if you log off Windows, then log in again. Not practical if you have files open (that you may wish to access) or the administrator can't log in locally (Interactive Login Privilege disabled). Impersonation may be set, as the page allows access to applications the regular user account doesn't (e.g. databases, files, Active Directory admin). Basically making a page within the site behave as though it is not part of the Trusted Sites zone.

@TITLE:ASP.NET MVC - pull and populate masterpage contents from database?
@CONTENT:how can I pull masterpage content from the database and pass that into the masterpage so that my Views inherits from it? This is an example: Clients to the website will have a unique code, lets call it "TargetCode", for example, ABC123, ABC456, etc... This unique code will be entered in the querystring, for example: mysite.com/ABC123. Each of those "TargetCode" will have a different CSS, name, address, phone number, (common to all pages, so these will be placed in the master page) and page contents (around 2-3 pages, lets call thse pages Index, Products, and MoreInfo). So when I visit the website address,mysite.com/ABC123, first it will look into the database, check if the code exists, if yes, then it pull the Masterpage information (css, name, address, phone number) and use that for the masterpage. Then I will pull the page contents (Index, Products, and MoreInfo) for the other Actions, all these pages will be using the same masterpage content of course. Thank you very much.

We've been reading about performance issues involving the use of extenionless urls in MVC applications specifically in the case of removing the '.aspx' extension from the controller portion of the url. Has anyone who has deployed an MVC app in the past experienced any performance degradation in this area? Was it noticeable, and was it worth it for having the cleaner URLs? Our application will rarely have to deal with more than 1000 or so concurrent users. Edit: Thanks for all the responses, it's working quite well, although there are a few strange requests going through as some people mentioned, I think we can work around these using the suggestions mentioned here.

I suppose this would work if javascript-enabled browsers who followed a search engine link to the ?c=somecontent link would still make use of the site normally, right?

@TITLE:Manually added location updates stop working in Eclipse
@CONTENT:I'm working on a 1.5 Android application. Developing in Eclipse 3.4.2 on Windows XP. I have a MapView, have requested updates, etc. The problem is that after the first manually injected GPS coordinate, the app stops recognizing that a GPS coord has been sent. LocationManager lm = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);  
MapController mc = mapView.getController();

TextView locationText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.LocationBar);

LocationListener locationListener = new MyLocationListener(mc, itemizedOverlay, locationText);

lm.requestLocationUpdates(
    LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 
    0, 
    0, 
    locationListener);
 Then MyLocationListener simply changes the value in a TextView to match the new GPS coordinate. public void onLocationChanged(Location loc) {
		if (loc == null) {
			return;
		}
		double lat = loc.getLatitude();
        double lng = loc.getLongitude();

        GeoPoint p = new GeoPoint(
            (int) (lat * 1E6), 
            (int) (lng * 1E6));

        mc.animateTo(p);

        itemizedOverlay.addOverlay(new OverlayItem(p, "title", "snippet"));

        String location = String.format("%f lat %f long", lat, lng);

        locationText.setText(location);

	}
 I added some logging in the onLocationChanged method and it only ever sees a Location the first time that I attempt to send an update. All subsequent ones don't fire the onLocationChanged method. Additional info: The logcat output is as follows: 10-02 17:22:34.423: INFO/gps(6671): Provider gps is has status changed to 1. Extras: Bundle[mParcelledData.dataSize=52]

 According to http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationProvider.html#AVAILABLE , that 2 maps to "Available". As soon as that "Available" gets set, no other locations get passed through. Seems a bit counterintuitive.

@LINK:/questions/1506212/complex-software-architecture
@TITLE:Complex software architecture
@CONTENT:I've got a few questions about the architecture of a software that I'm working on ! So basically, this software allow the user to access to some popular sites : Social networks (Facebook, MySpace, ...), Common services (RSS, Mails, Twitter...), Social bookmarkings (Digg, Delicious...), Chats (MSN, AOL...), ... Currently the architecture looks like this : Use of MVC and Observer/Observable design patterns for interaction between the model (TApp_Core) and the user interface. TApp_Core
 TBookmarkingServices_Core
  TDelicious (implement IBookmarkingServices) 
  TDigg (implement IBookmarkingServices) 
  etc... (implement IBookmarkingServices) 
 TChatServices_Core 
  TMSN (implement IChatServices) 
  TGoogleChat (implement IChatServices) 
  TAOLChat (implement IChatServices) 
  etc... 
 TRSSServices_Core 
 ...
 So the software create an instance of TApp_Core and then depending on the user's choice, it creates some instances of other services (ex : App_Core.BookmarkingServices_Core.AddServices(Digg, User, Password);). Some questions ! Do you think that the current software design is right ? There is currently only one thread for all the software... Is creating a new thread for each request to a service would be better ? (for example the TDigg receive a message from a button, it creates a thread which will create a TidHTTP, generate the request to the server, wait for the response, parse the response, send a message to each observer (callback) and then free the thread. It seems very hard to link all View/Controller with each part of the model, is that normal that it requires so much works ? Ex : to send a message for example using with Twitter, it would require to : Attach a controller (button) to a TApp_Core.TMicrobloggingServices_Core.TTwiter object (model) wait the user to click on the button Send a message to TTwiter (the model) Create a thread to send the request to the server Parse the response from the server Execute callbacks to notify that the request has been executed and to give the result Free the thread If I use the previous idea, won't it create too much threads and make the computer slow and less responsible ? Except, if I implement a thread pool (but it's quite complex to use it). Does SQLite 3 is good enough to store all data on the client ? (data can be mails, rss feed, etc... so it can be quite a lot of data with times). Thanks and sorry for my bad English !

Compatibility with either the XML, ICAL or HTML feed will do. It should be able to give different colors to different events based on the feeds which they originated from. It would be nice if the calendar could also give different colors based on certains tags in the event titles, like all events starting with "Test: " will be red, and all events starting with "Deadline: " can be blue. The interface should be nice, but simple. It should be easy to implement, and no dependency on Javascript would be good. Preferably, it will work simply on PHP. It must provide 3 views of the calendar: Month, Week & Agenda Features I don't require are: Write ability (the calendars can/should be read-only) Multiple-day events or recurring events Links or html content inside events What would be the simplest pre-made solution to implementing this? Currently, I am trying out various solutions like FullCalendar, and the various solutions listed at the Plans Website. However, none of them are perfect, because either they are not supported any more, or require javascript, or don't have all the features I need.

 perhaps can I achieve that the a, b, c and d with its belonging edges are clusters where I set a different rankdir for the clusters? EDIT Just found a solution by adding invisible edges between a, b, c and d but any other solutions?

The site will start small but will hopefully be scalable. I realize developers tend to prefer a specific language and/or CMS and am wondering if you think a particular language would be best for creating a site with these features: Short user profiles, photo upload, automatically generated thumbnails, a simple rating system, photo galleries, a blog section, ability to serve ads, user verification, polls, forms to enter contests, a taggable, searchable how-to library, a video library (using videos hosted on other sites)

@TITLE:Linq to SQL - Retain DataContext across post-backs?
@CONTENT:I read Rick Strahl's post about DataContext lifetime management, and some of the other related questions on Stackoverflow. If they contained an answer to my question, I must have missed it. I generally follow the atomic approach and instantiate a DataContext for a unit of work when it is needed, and dispose it afterwards. This worked well until I hit a scenario with a complex page that contains a multi-view control with several grids and popup panels that all represent one unit of work. The data is in memory (I actually stuff the root object into the session so that the entire hierarchy is available across post-backs). Obviously, the DataContext is long gone by the time the user clicks on "Save". Tom Brune's comment caught my eye at first, because it seemed like such an elegant approach - to use reflection to "wet" a fresh copy of the object and to update the database using a new DataContext. However, Rick's concerns about this approach are valid, and since my data structures are complex and hierarchical, I don't think I will try this. So I am left with few options, as far as I see. either use Rick's suggestion to deserialize/serialize the object and re-attach it to a new context hand-code the logic that compares and updates a fresh copy of the object Which one should I follow, and is there a third option, i.e. can I keep the DataContext around between post-backs? If that's feasible, it would require the least amount of coding, as my root object has about a dozen children.

I've tried to even remove all dependencies from the Build\Configuration Manager (unchecked the build column for all assemblies, but the one in question). I get the same result: the assembly is rebuilt each time. I have to mention that all the dependencies are built in the same directory (there is a common Output Directory). Actually it's not very clear to me what is the VS/MSBuild algorithm to decide whether a project should be rebuilt or not. Does it check to see whether there are dependencies (files/assemblies) that have the Last Access NTFS timestamp newer than the one on the assembly in question? Maybe I could try to search for the "offending" file this way.

@LINK:/questions/1484861/calling-a-flex-as3-callback-from-javascript
@TITLE:Calling a Flex/AS3 Callback from Javascript
@CONTENT:I have a Javascript API, which should be usable with GWT and Flex. Using the FABridge it is really easy to call Javascript methods from AS3 and vice versa. But when I try to register a callback to an AS3 method in my Javascript API I get stuck. Here is a short code sample: public function initApp():void {
    if (ExternalInterface.available) { 
    	ExternalInterface.addCallback("foobar", foobar);
}
}

public function foobar():void {
    //the callback function
    Alert.show("Callback from API works!");
}

private function btnCallbackClicked():void {
    ExternalInterface.call("testAPICallbackFromJS", Application.application.foobar);
}
 And the simple JS method: function testAPICallbackFromGWT(callback){
  $clinit_26(); //added by the GWT compiler
  alert('callback to be launched 3 2 1');
  callback();
}
 But this version does not work, because I always receive an empty function in my JS code. It seems that the FABridge is cutting the rest. Then I tried a different approach. I wrote a little JS method, which takes the name of the function and creates the callback from the JS side. registerFlexCallback = function(registerMethod, callback, id) {
    /*
    workaround to create a callback for an AS method, which can be called by Javascript
    	* registerMethod - Javascript method which shall be called for registration with the created callback as parameter
    	* callback - AS method that shall be called by Javascript (available over the FABridge interface)
    	* id - ID of the flash object (use Application.application.id in AS)
    */
    var swf = document.getElementById(id);
    eval(registerMethod + "(swf." + callback + ");");
};
 This one works well with the Internet Explorer, but with no other browser. For example in Firefox I get the following error message: NPMethod called on non-NPObject wrapped JSObject!
 Can somebody tell me, what this error is about (maybe some kind of security issue)? Or does anyone have a better idea how to create callbacks for my AS3 methods which can be called by JS?
@CODE:public function initApp():void {
    if (ExternalInterface.available) { 
    	ExternalInterface.addCallback("foobar", foobar);
}
}

public function foobar():void {
    //the callback function
    Alert.show("Callback from API works!");

  $clinit_26(); //added by the GWT compiler

  callback();

@LINK:/questions/1481177/servicemix-4-dosgi-and-zookeeper
@TITLE:Servicemix 4, DOSGi, and Zookeeper
@CONTENT:This is cross posted from the fusesource forum and the servicemmix forum. I can't get DOSGi working in FUSE. I'm trying to get CXF's DOSGi 1.1-SNAPSHOT with Zookeeper discovery onto FUSE 4.1.0.2. I'm also using Zookeepr 3.2.1. Everything works perfectly on Felix 2.0.0. I just follow the instructions on the DOSGi Discovery page and then install the Discovery Demo bundles. For DOSGi, I just use the cxf-dosgi-ri-singlebundle-distribution-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar for DSW and cxf-dosgi-ri-discovery-singlebundle-distribution-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar for zookeepr discovery. Then when I start the sample bundles with the sample service impl on one machine, I see the node creation in zookeeper. Then I start the sample client on another machine and I see the output on the service machine. Works great. I do have an warning about an xml error being ignored because some XSD coudln't be found, but it doesn't seem to affect anything. Oh, I also have to install the OSGi compendium bundle first. When I move to Fuse, I have no such luck. The OSGi compendium bundle comes with fuse, so no need to install that. I should just be able to install the dosgi-ri singlebundle, and the dosgi-ri-discovery single bundle, but that doesn't work. The dosgi-ri singlebundle has all kinds of overlapping bundles with servicemix. I get an error about port 8081? or whatever the osgi.http.service parameter is, being already in use. Apparently the dosgi-ri singlebundle comes with pax webservice, which reads the same property as the servicemix http service bundle that comes with servicemix. Thats when I switch to the cxf-dosgi-ri-multibundle-distribution-1.1-SNAPSHOT.zip and unzip it to take the parts I want. I take the dsw bundle out of the dosgi-ri multibundle and install that. No luck because of the jdom dependency. Then I install the jdom that comes in the ri multibundle, which works fine. Then go back to dsw, and that installs, so I think i'm getting somewhere. Time to go back and install the ri-discovery singlebundle. When I start that I get a pax logging service classcastexception saying it can't be cast to a osgi logservice or something. But thats just a logging error, and at the bottom it says it can't find the transport class for http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http. Ok, so logging is screwed up and I'm missing some transport class. Well, clearly this comes from not installing enough from the ri multibundle because it worked on felix. So what else in there is necessary. The cxf-minimal-bundle upon inspection has the missing class causing that last error. So I install that. Try to start the discovery bundle, but I end up with some kind of corbabroker exception. Wtf. Whose using corba in all of this? Then I go back and undo all of that and try to stick with the singlebundle distros of ri and ri-discovery, but just turn off the servicemix http service. That crashes servicemix and I can't restart it becauuse the cxf jbi components end up with an unsatisfied dependency. Odd. I'll just ignore that because I don't use those anyway, and try to start my samples. Can't start the samples because it says jetty can't start because the ports already in use. Doesn't make sense because I shutdown the servicemix http service already. Then I restart jetty. Works? Maybe. My service gets registered and I can browse to the wsdl using firefox, but no registration in zookeeper. Try to shutdown the ri-discovery bundle and restart it, but I get a nullpointerexception. Appparently the ri-discovery never actually started up due to one of the aforementioned errors. Then I started trying to take apart the ri-discovery singlebundle and pull out the internals. That didn't work because its all apparently necessary, even though theres some libs inside we could do without. End of the story. Can't get it to work. Can anybody else get it to work? I just want to run the discovery samples in SMX4. I'm pretty sure its just a bundle conflict problem. Isn't this what OSGi is supposed to fix??? This is worse than just telling me what jars you depend on and making me setup my classpath. At least then I'd eventually get the thing running. My next steps, I think, will be to try again with the ri-multibundle, just the dsw and jdom, plus the ri-discovery singlebundle. Then I'll try some of the cxf-fuse bundles or some of the cxf-rt bundles to get around the soap transport issue. Edit notes: I need more than just showing the DOSGi bundles in an Active state. They don't actually do much until you try to expose a service through them. I do need to see multiple machines registering services with a zookeeper instance and other machines consuming those services -- just like the running DOSGi Discovery Sample. I've been able to get cxf to expose the distributed service sample as a soap webservice by using the minimal cxf bundle mentioned by either removing parts of the original cxf bundles and restarting the jetty service, and then starting the sample service... or by installing the cxf minimal buundle, then starting my service, then immediately uninstalling the cxf minimal bundle, then restarting jetty... I think that was the order. Neither of these will work from a clean startup, and having to restart services as a procedure to get DOSGi working is just bad. I don't even know why installing then uninstalling would do anything -- it shouldn't be leaving any artifacts around.

But I'm not sure how to go about doing this? Would I do it inside my user session controller or is there some fancy way to extend authlogic inside the model? If someone could point me in the right the direction, i'd be grateful. Here's an example of what I have now with the two pages: http://morning-warrior-55.heroku.com/ Thanks,

@TITLE:How can I make an ¡§Accordion Widget¡¨ in WPF?
@CONTENT:The goal: I'm trying to achieve something like this in WPF: An initial solution: At the moment, I'm trying to use an ItemsControl with an ItemTemplate composed of an Expander. I want a consistent look for the Header portion of the Expander, but I want the Content portion of the Expander to be completely flexible. So, it's basically a set of "portlets" stacked vertically, where each portlet has a consistent title bar but different content. The code so far: This is what I have at the moment: <ItemsControl
    Grid.Row="2"
    Grid.Column="2">
    <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <Expander>
                <Expander.HeaderTemplate>
                    <DataTemplate>
                        <StackPanel

 Discussion: The only thing that shows up when I run this is the DataGrid of users and the buttons ("Add New User" and "Delete User") below it. There is no Expander or title bar. Also, even if I did see one, I'm not sure how to set up a Binding for the title that appears on the title bar. I know how to do bindings if I use ItemsSource, but I wanted to set my items declaratively. The question: How should I go about this? I'm looking for either a fix for what I have now or a clean-sheet solution. Edit: What I ended up doing was replacing the ItemsControl with a StackPanel and just writing a style for my expanders. This proved to be much simpler, and there really was no benefit to the ItemsControl since I needed to declare custom content for each item anyway. The one issue remaining was how to achieve a custom title for each expander. That's where @Thomas Levesque's suggestion to use TemplateBinding came in. All I had to do was replace Text="Title_Of_Expander_Goes_Here" in my header's template (see code above) with Text="{TemplateBinding Content}".

@TITLE:Ruby:Watir cannot connect to IE running under non-Admin account on 'default' desktop
@CONTENT:Some Background on architecture of the app is needed: Windows 2003/Apache-v2.2/IE7/Watir-v1.6.2/Ruby-v1.8.5 Apache running under 'localsystem' account. Request to run a Watir script comes in. Apache CGI kicks off IE7 under a particular user, e.g. 'tester', and attaches the IE7 window to the "default" desktop environment. This allows us to VNC into the machine and see all IE7 windows from all the accounts running. IE7 has ruby embedded into the process through plugin and executes the ruby script in a thread. For clicking on links/buttons in IE, Watir supplies a synchronous 'click' method and async 'click_no_wait' method. 'click_no_wait' spawns a completely new ruby process to connect back to the IE7 window to click the link/button. This is what is failing for me. Since click_no_wait is spawning a new process. It cannot seem to see the IE7 window to connect to it and click on the link/button. I have to use 'click_no_wait' due to a dialog box that IE pops up on a certain page, so that another ruby thread can close it. I've tried a few things: - using fire_event('OnClick') instead of click_no_wait hangs script like 'click' would. - Modifying 'click' by commenting out '@container.wait', but the 'click!' itself is the API that hangs waiting for the dialog box to close. - Make 'click_no_wait' spawn a new thread instead of a process', but other threads appear to be suspended while the 'click!' call executes in that thread. Which is strange. - Executing the 'click_no_wait' process using the exact same code that is used to spawn the IE7 process, but it still can't find any IE7 windows. By 'default' desktop described above, the code that spawns IE basically does a series of C++ calls to attach the IE7 window to the 'winsta0' desktop: - LogonUser() // log in as tester account
- OpenWindowStation("winsta0") // to get default desktop
- SetProcessWindowStation()
- // add the user to interactive window station using (GetUserObjectSecurity, GetSecurityDescriptorDacl, GetAclInformation, AddAce, SetSecurityDescriptorDacl, SetUserObjectSecurity)
- // add user to "default" desktop using APIs listed above.
- CreateEnvironmentBlock
- ImpersonateLoggedOnUser
- CreateProcessAsUser('iexplore.exe')   
- // cleanup
 Running the following Watir script under the particular user IE7 is running under yields: $IE = Watir::IE.attach(:title, /Google/)
$IE.button(:name, 'btnG').click!
 c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/watir-1.6.2/lib/watir/ie-class.rb:246:in `method_missing': Windows (WIN32OLERuntimeError) OLE error code:80040154 in HRESULT error code:0x80020009 Exception occurred. from c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/watir-1.6.2/lib/watir/ie-class.rb:246:in "each" Which contains: c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/watir-1.6.2/lib/watir/ie-class.rb:246

@TITLE:How to split file into chunks while still writing into it?
@CONTENT:I tried to create byte array blocks from file whil the process was still using the file for writing. Actually I am storing video into file and I would like to create chunks from the same file while recording. The following method was supposed to read blocks of bytes from file: private byte[] getBytesFromFile(File file) throws IOException{
    InputStream is = new FileInputStream(file);
    long length = file.length();

    int numRead = 0;

    byte[] bytes = new byte[(int)length - mReadOffset];
    numRead = is.read(bytes, mReadOffset, bytes.length - mReadOffset);
    if(numRead != (bytes.length - mReadOffset)){
        throw new IOException("Could not completely read file " + file.getName());
    }

    mReadOffset += numRead;
    is.close();
    return bytes;
}
 But the problem is that all array elements are set to 0 and I guess it is because the writing process locks the file. I would bevery thankful if anyone of you could show any other way to create file chunks while writing into file.

@TITLE:File access, unit testing, dependency injection
@CONTENT:I've recently asked a question regarding best ways of separating business logic from data access to make application testable (here). Thanks to Jeff Sternal, I've created interface for the data access and passing its concrete implementation from the application top level to BL. But now I'm trying to figure out how can I separate file access methods from business logic. Let's say I have a function that loads data from a database into dataset, formats loaded data (formats are stored in some external xml file) and finally serializes dataset to a file. So, to support testability I need to move all the functions that access file system to some interface. But first - I find it quite handy to just call dataset.WriteXml(file), but for the testability I have to create interface and move dataset.WriteXml() to its implementation, which looks to me as unnecessary layer and makes code less obvious. And second - if I move all methods that access file system to a single interface, it will violate SRP principle, because serializing\deserializing datasets and reading data formats from a file seems to be different responsibilities, correct?

@CONTENT:I just spent some time debugging a problem that boiled down to forgetting to use the var keyword in front of a new variable identifier, so Javascript was automatically creating that variable in the global scope. Is there any way to prevent this, or change the default behavior, without using a validator like JSLint? Running a validator in between writing and executing Javascript code seems like a poor excuse for compiling, which is the step I'd usually rely on to catch this sort of thing. I'm guessing the answer is a "no," so I'm looking into a JSLint Eclipse plugin as I post this.

@CONTENT:When the document(uri) function is used to load another document within the XSLT, where the target document contains a DTD I get an XslTransformException, containing an inner XmlException: For security reasons DTD is prohibited in this XML document. To enable DTD processing set the ProhibitDtd property on XmlReaderSettings to false and pass the settings into XmlReader.Create method. As the XmlReader is created within the XSLT implementation there is no direct way to create the XmlReader with the settings I want, and none of the XslCompiledTransform, XmlResolver1 or related classes seem to provide any form of hook. (I'm using a DTD to set some HTML entities to make the authoring of the document easier.) 1 based on looking at XmlUrlResolver in Reflector this just loaded the URI's target as a Stream. E.g. is the XSLT contains <xsl:apply-templates select="document('more.xml')/root"/>
 and more.xml contains a DTD then the exception above is the result.

@TITLE:How to make WPF pop-up windows not be hidden behind main application?
@CONTENT:In a WPF application, I have buttons which pop up instances of windows. I click the first button and the first window pops up correctly in front of the main application. I click the second button and the second window pops up correct in front of the main application. However, the first window now moves behind the main application. This is confusing and unexpected since it is often in the middle of the main application and thus seems that it disappears until the user moves the main application to find it hiding behind. This is the XAML: <Window x:Class="TestPopupFix.Window1"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    Title="Window1" Height="600" Width="800">
    <StackPanel>
        <Button Content="Open first popup" Click="Button_OpenFirst"/>
        <Button Content="Open second popup" Click="Button_OpenSecond"/>
    </StackPanel>
</Window>
 And this the code behind: private void Button_OpenFirst(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Window window = new Window();
    TextBlock tb = new TextBlock();
    tb.Text = "This is the first window.";
    window.Content = tb;
    window.Width = 300;
    window.Height = 300;
    window.Show();
}

private void Button_OpenSecond(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Window window = new Window();
    TextBlock tb = new TextBlock();
    tb.Text = "This is the second window.";
    window.Content = tb;
    window.Width = 300;
    window.Height = 300;
    window.Show();
}
 What do I have to do to make the main application stay furthest to the back as I pop up new windows?

 Since the created_at times differ by 3 hours, I assume this is related to the 3 hour difference between EDT and PDT, but I'm not sure what's going on. EDIT: Here's what the raw data looks like: sqlite> Select created_at from annotations where id = 2028;

@TITLE:Date Range Intersection Splitting in SQL
@CONTENT:I have a SQL Server 2005 database which contains a table called Memberships. The table schema is: PersonID int, Surname nvarchar(30), FirstName nvarchar(30), Description nvarchar(100), StartDate datetime, EndDate datetime I'm currently working on a grid feature which shows a break-down of memberships by person. One of the requirements is to split membership rows where there is an intersection of date ranges. The intersection must be bound by the Surname and FirstName, ie splits only occur with membership records of the same Surname and FirstName. Example table data: 18  Smith  John  Poker Club  01/01/2009  NULL
18  Smith  John  Library     05/01/2009  18/01/2009

I think I can probably do a bit better though. Is it possible to avoid the creation of a bunch of NSString's here, and instead split the big NSString (routeGeom) into a bunch of char buffers and iterate through those? I have never done any C programming, so if you know how to get this done, it would be much appreciated! NSTimeInterval start = [NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate];

NSString *routeGeom = [pieces objectAtIndex:1];
NSArray *splitPoints = [routeGeom componentsSeparatedByString:@"],["];

routePoints = malloc(sizeof(CLLocationCoordinate2D) * ([splitPoints count] + 1));

int i=0;
for (NSString* coordStr in splitPoints) {

  char *buf = [coordStr UTF8String];
  sscanf(buf, "%f,%f,", &routePoints[i].latitude, &routePoints[i].longitude);

  i++;

});

 The showMessage() function in the second file I would like to use it in others jquery-style js files, like in the first one. The problem is that I get an error saying that showMessage() is undefined when I try to use it. This is happening with every other function I call which is in a separate jquery-style file. If showMessage() function is not inside $(document).ready(function(){.....}); then it is called, but then it's unusable with jquery. I also make sure that the file that contains showMessage() function is loaded before the file which calls it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

@TITLE:How to connect to a GObject signal in python, without it keeping a reference to the connecter?
@CONTENT:The problem is basically this, in python's gobject and gtk bindings. Assume we have a class that binds to a signal when constructed: class ClipboardMonitor (object):
  def __init__(self):
    clip = gtk.clipboard_get(gtk.gdk.SELECTION_CLIPBOARD)
    clip.connect("owner-change", self._clipboard_changed)
 The problem is now that, no instance of ClipboardMonitor will ever die. The gtk clipboard is an application-wide object, and connecting to it keeps a reference to the object, since we use the callback self._clipboard_changed. I'm debating how to work around this using weak references (weakref module), but I have yet to come up with a plan. Anyone have an idea how to pass a callback to the signal registration, and have it behave like a weak reference (if the signal callback is called when the ClipboardMonitor instance is out of scope, it should be a no-op). Addition: Phrased independently of GObject or GTK+: How do you provide a callback method to an opaque object, with weakref semantics? If the connecting object goes out of scope, it should be deleted and the callback should act as a no-op; the connectee should not hold a reference to the connector. To clarify: I explicitly want to avoid having to call a "destructor/finalizer" method
@CODE:class ClipboardMonitor (object):
  def __init__(self):
    clip = gtk.clipboard_get(gtk.gdk.SELECTION_CLIPBOARD)

@CONTENT:Windows 7 has a (neat?) new feature called a 'virtual wireless adapter'. Read about it here: http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090516/windows-7-native-virtual-wifi-technology-microsoft-research/ I have an application that directly controls the windows wifi interface card using the Native Wifi API ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms706556%28VS.85%29.aspx ). Please take as a given for this question that I need to directly control the wifi adapter using this documented api and can't just leave it up to OS and user. The Windows 7 virtual adapter is supposed to be included with any approved Windows 7 wifi drivers. The drivers that out there now seem to be pretty buggy, and I've found that unless I manually disable the virtual wifi adapter the real adapter will not reliably connect to a wireless access point when commanded by the WLAN api. My main question is 'How to I detect the presence of a windows virtual wifi adapter?' Note that the documentation for WlanEnumInterfaces says: This virtual device normally shows up in the ¡§Network Connections Folder¡¨ as ¡¥Wireless Network Connection 2¡¦ with a Device Name of ¡¥Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport adapter¡¦ if the computer has a single wireless network adapter. This virtual device is used exclusively for performing software access point (SoftAP) connections and is not present in the list returned by the WlanEnumInterfaces function . I suspect there is shell api that might provide the enumeration that the control panel uses to display the virtual adapter. For extra credit, how can I disable this adapter programatically?

@TITLE:HTTP Proxy/FastCGI/SCGI not closing connection when client disconnected - bug or feature?
@CONTENT:I'm working on Comet support for CppCMS framework via long XMLHttpRequest polls. In many cases, such request is closed by client before any response from server was given -- for example the page is closed, user moves to other page or it is just refeshed. At the server side I expect that I would recieve the notification that connection is dropped. I tested the application via 3 connectors: FastCGI, SCGI and simple HTTP Proxy. From 3 major UNIX web servers, Apache2, lighttpd and Nginx, only the last one had closed connection as expected allowing my application to remove the request from wait queue -- this worked for both FastCGI and HTTP Proxy connectors. (Nginx does not have scgi module by default). Others, Apache and Lighttpd do not close connection or inform the backend about disconnected clients, the proceed as if the client is still on line. This happens for all 3 supported APIs: FastCGI, SCGI and HTTP Proxy. I had opened an issue for Lighttpd, but what more conserns me is the fact that Apache -- mature and well supported web server as lighttpd and does not discloses the server backend that client had gone. Questions: Is this a bug or this is a feature? Is there any reason not to close the connection between web server and application backend? Are there real life Comet application working behind these servers via FastCGI/SCGI/HTTP-Proxy backends? If the above true, how do they deal with this issue? I understand that I can timeout all connections every 10 seconds, but I would like to keep them idle as far as client listens -- because this allows easier scale up -- each connection is very cheep -- the cost is only the opended socket.

They all have unique heights, assuming the values are 100-199cm. You want to build 10 groups, each consisting of 1-99 children. How can you build all the groups while the children must be sorted by their height? I need all possible solutions for these groups since it isn't hard to find one constellation. Short and easy: All 100 children stand side by side. You only have to decide where to split them into groups and find all solutions for this. Example (values are the heights): [120 ... 190 ... 199] ... [126 ... 137 ... 144 ... 188] is not possible [101] ... [104 ... 105 ... 112 ... 149] ... [169 ... 189] is possible I hope you can help me. Thank you very much in advance! PS: It's no homework. ;) Normally, I need a function which does this with numbers. But I couldn't describe this abstractly like "building k groups of numbers while all numbers are sorted".

When all the tasks are finished reset the DispatchTimer ??? (not sure if this can / needs to be / done). Remember, this is background task so a user could be using the UI at the same time.

@TITLE:Detecting different quit options in AIR application on Mac
@CONTENT:I have an AIR application running on a Mac and I want to have the behavior of hiding the window when someone "closes" the app (e.g. hits the red "x" button or cmd-w). However, if someone hits cmd-q or chooses "Quit" from the dock context menu or top level menu, I want the app to actually close. I can preventDefault on the "closing" event sent by the application, however, this causes all "close" methods to just hide the window. The only way for someone to close the application at that point is ForceQuit (or through a separate interface I provide, like a context menu option on the dock icon). I have also tried capturing the cmd-q keyDown event manually, but it doesn't get sent. Also, this wouldn't help for the case when people try to quit the app using the menu options. Furthermore, if I preventDefault on the closing method, it causes my application to cancel a shut down process immediately (which is a terrible user experience). Is there a way to detect different methods of closing an AIR application? I want to be able to tell the difference between these closing methods and react to the appropriately.

@TITLE:Android CursorAdapters, ListViews and background threads
@CONTENT:This application I've been working on has databases with multiple megabytes of data to sift through. A lot of the activities are just ListViews descending through various levels of data within the databases until we reach "documents", which is just HTML to be pulled from the DB(s) and displayed on the phone. The issue I am having is that some of these activities need to have the ability to search through the databases by capturing keystrokes and re-running the query with a "like %blah%" in it. This works reasonably quickly except when the user is first loading the data and when the user first enters a keystroke. I am using a ResourceCursorAdapter and I am generating the cursor in a background thread, but in order to do a listAdapter.changeCursor(), I have to use a Handler to post it to the main UI thread. This particular call is then freezing the UI thread just long enough to bring up the dreaded ANR dialog. I'm curious how I can offload this to a background thread totally so the user interface remains responsive and we don't have ANR dialogs popping up. Just for full disclosure, I was originally returning an ArrayList of custom model objects and using an ArrayAdapter, but (understandably) the customer pointed out it was bad memory-manangement and I wasn't happy with the performance anyways. I'd really like to avoid a solution where I'm generating huge lists of objects and then doing a listAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged/Invalidated() Here is the code in question: private Runnable filterDrugListRunnable = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        if (filterLock.tryLock() == false) return;

        cur = ActivityUtils.getIndexItemCursor(DrugListActivity.this);

        if (cur == null || forceRefresh == true) {
            cur = docDb.getItemCursor(selectedIndex.getIndexId(), filter);
            ActivityUtils.setIndexItemCursor(DrugListActivity.this, cur);
            forceRefresh = false;
        }

@TITLE:Critique my exception handling strategy
@CONTENT:I've been doing object-oriented programming for most of the past 7 years, using Java on and off during that time. Some things I'm certain I have an excellent grasp of, such as the most useful design patterns. In fact, the following code allowed me to crank out a little system in under a day's time, that would handle the one particular instance we are ready to implement now, while being flexible enough to handle the future requirements I've been informed of: public void importAndArchive(File detectedFile) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
        File workingCopy = returnWorkingCopy(detectedFile);
        List<String[]> csvData = csvData(workingCopy);
        setHeaderFields(csvData.get(0));

        importData(csvData); //subclass will implement this abstract method

        archiveWorkingCopy(workingCopy);
    }
 I don't show the above to boast about my grasp of the template method, but rather as a starting point to discuss a gap I have in my abilities that is glaring in light of my OO design abilities. And that gap is, a systematic approach to exception handling. Indeed you can see in that method signature I am for the time being re-throwing some exceptions, but actually I've gone on to eradicate the very same sort of thing in another corner of the application. Before I go much further though, since this is my first attempt to be especially systematic, I would like some validation of what I've done thus far. Our application loops over a bunch of files, "processes" them, and "archives" them. Pretty standard fare. One decision I've made in order to roll out a prototype as quickly as possible is as follows. The application gets initialized based on data in a (ResourceBundled) properties file. The various methods in the ResourceBundle API throw unchecked exceptions, but I am not really handling them whatsoever for the time being, on the grounds that they will prevent the app from starting, and the stacktrace can suffice for the time being. I have however chosen a library for CSV handling which throws checked exceptions. NetBeans then made it very easy to proliferate those exceptions to begin with ;) The following is a method that I've since reworked that actually handles those exceptions: private String detectImportHandler(File detectedFile) throws Exception {
    String[] firstLine = null;

    try {
        /*
         * CSVReader throws checked exceptions
         */
        CSVReader csvReader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(detectedFile));
        firstLine = csvReader.readNext();
        csvReader.close();
    }
    catch(Exception x) {
        throw new Exception("CSVReader unable to process file: " + x.getMessage());
    }

    try {
        return firstLine[1];
    }
    catch(Exception x) {
        /*
         * since we're re-throwing CSVReader's checked exceptions it seems easiest
         * to also re-throw null-pointer and/or array-out-of-bounds errors
         */
        throw new Exception(
                "First line null or did not have importHandlerType field: " + x.getMessage());
    }
}
 The above method is being called thusly, inside a loop that processes the files:     try {
        importHandlerType = detectImportHandler(detectedFile);
    }
    catch(Exception x) {
        unusableFileErrors.put(detectedFile.getName(), x.getMessage());
        continue;
    }
 unusableFileErrors is a Map, and I figure when I am done iterating over the files, I can then use this map and the file-specific messages it contains to handle things at a higher level, such as logging, moving the files somewhere else on the system, etc. Anyway I've gone on long enough. I have ordered the book "Robust Java" and I'm hoping between it, and the SO community, I can improve this neglected facet of my abilities. I've seen other similar questions on SO but I figure that also requesting specific advice in the context of actual code might be of benefit.
@CODE:public void importAndArchive(File detectedFile) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
        File workingCopy = returnWorkingCopy(detectedFile);
        List<String[]> csvData = csvData(workingCopy);
        setHeaderFields(csvData.get(0));

        importData(csvData); //subclass will implement this abstract method

        archiveWorkingCopy(workingCopy);
    } private String detectImportHandler(File detectedFile) throws Exception {
    String[] firstLine = null;

    try {
        /*
         * CSVReader throws checked exceptions
         */
        CSVReader csvReader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(detectedFile));
        firstLine = csvReader.readNext();
        csvReader.close();
    }
    catch(Exception x) {
        throw new Exception("CSVReader unable to process file: " + x.getMessage());
    }

    try {
        return firstLine[1];
    }
    catch(Exception x) {
        /*
         * since we're re-throwing CSVReader's checked exceptions it seems easiest
         * to also re-throw null-pointer and/or array-out-of-bounds errors

Vector3f direction = new Vector3f(1,2,1);    

final double angleX = direction.angle(new Vector3f(1,0,0));
final double angleY = direction.angle(new Vector3f(0,1,0));
final double angleZ = direction.angle(new Vector3f(0,0,1));

t3d.rotX(angleX);
t3d.rotY(angleY);
t3d.rotZ(angleZ);

t3d.setTranslation(direction);

coneTransform.setTransform(t3d);
 Thanks in advance for all help!
@CODE:Cone cone = new Cone(2f, 3f);

Transform3D t3d = new Transform3D();
TransformGroup coneTransform = new TransformGroup(t3d);
coneTransform.setCapability(TransformGroup.ALLOW_TRANSFORM_WRITE);

t3d.setTranslation(new Vector3f(0f,0f,0f);
coneTransform.setTransform(t3d);
coneTransform.addChild(cone);

this.addChild(coneTransform); Transform3D t3d = new Transform3D();  

Vector3f direction = new Vector3f(1,2,1);    

final double angleX = direction.angle(new Vector3f(1,0,0));
final double angleY = direction.angle(new Vector3f(0,1,0));
final double angleZ = direction.angle(new Vector3f(0,0,1));

t3d.rotX(angleX);
t3d.rotY(angleY);
t3d.rotZ(angleZ);

t3d.setTranslation(direction);

@TITLE:PdfSharp - Wrong PDF page settings when document is opened in Acrobat
@CONTENT:I have written a piece of code which uses the PdfSharp library. The instance of PdfSharp.Pdf.PdfDocument created saves to disk as expected. The right content is displayed, but onto the wrong page settings. The default page settings for PdfSharp are: PdfSharp.PageSizes.A4 PdfSharp.PageOrientation.Portrait My problem is that these settings seem to override the required settings. I create the instance of PdfDocument class and adds a new instance of PdfPage class to its Pages collection property. Then, I setup the page like this: PdfDocument.Pages[0].Size = PdfSharp.PageSizes.Letter PdfDocument.Pages[0].Orientation = PdfSharp.PageOrientation.Landscape I draw the strings (this works fine) I save the document to disk (this works fine) Process.Start(myPdfFilename) - then Acrobat Reader opens with my document. The page settings are A4 - Portrait... I'm quite confused. I know of an option within Acrobat Reader that allows the user to change the page orientation without changing the text direction. No matter whether I check this option or not, still the wrong settings keep going. Anyone has an idea? Thanks!

@CONTENT:I am trying to figure out NSXMLParser for my iPhone app and while I generally understand how it works, I am still a little confused about how to extract the values I need. The XML result that I am parsing is very basic. it is like so: <start>
 <status>300</status>
 <record>
  <title>The Title</title>
  <content>Some content</content>
 </record>
</start>
 I need to do 3 things: Get the value of status. Get the value of content from the first record. There may come a response that offers multiple "record" elements so I need to only get the first. I can't figure out how to simply do that. Most all of the examples I have seen involve creating a separate object to populate this data into and I can't see that being necessary for 2 values. Can anyone tell me how to pull these 2 pieces of data out and only for the first record?

@TITLE:C# serialPort speed
@CONTENT:I am developing some monitoring tool for some kind of protocol based on serial communication. Serial BaudRate=187,5kb I use System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class. This protocol has 4 kinds of frames. They have 1Byte,3Bytes,6Bytes, 10-255Bytes. I can work with them but I receive them too late to respond. For the beginning I receive first packed after ex. 96ms (too late), and it contains about 1000B. This means 20-50 frames (too much, too late). Later its work more stable, 3-10Bytes but it is still too late because it contains 1-2 frames. Of Course 1 frame is OK, but 2 is too late. Can you point me how can I deal with it more reliable? I know it is possible. Revision1: I tried straight way: private void serialPort1_DataReceived(object sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e)
{
       if (!serialPort1.IsOpen) return;
       this.BeginInvoke(new EventHandler(this.DataReceived));
}
 And Backgroud worker: And ... new Tread(Read) and... always the same. Too late, too slow. Do I have to go back to WinApi and import some kernel32.dll functions? Revision 2: this is the part of code use in the Treading way: int c = serialPort1.BytesToRead;
byte[] b = new byte[c];
serialPort1.Read(b, 0, c);
 I guess it is some problem with stream use inside SerialPort class. Or some synchronization problem. Revision 3: I do not use both at once!! I just tried different ways. Regards MarekK

@CONTENT:I'm using an tableView with custom cells. When I want to display another view using the pushViewController function of the navigationController I loop through the textfields and call resignFirstResponder on them. But resignFirstResponder does only work when the textfields are being displayed so I scroll first to the top of the page. This is the code: NSIndexPath *topIndexPath;
topIndexPath = [[NSIndexPath indexPathWithIndex:0] indexPathByAddingIndex:0];
[self.tableView scrollToRowAtIndexPath:topIndexPath atScrollPosition:UITableViewScrollPositionTop animated:NO];

[[self textFieldForRow:0] resignFirstResponder];
[[self textFieldForRow:1] resignFirstResponder];
[[self textFieldForRow:2] resignFirstResponder];
[[self textFieldForRow:3] resignFirstResponder];
 This works, but after this my tableView has some weird problem with its origin. I tried to set it's superviews origin to 0, but that doesn't help. Here is a screenshot of the problem: link As you can see, my tableview is too large and the scrollbar is stuck in the middle of the view when reaching the bottom. Sorry for my english, I hope that you can understand me, Thanks in advance! Hans

This kept all Core Data specific code out of my UITableViewController. Now I want to add NSFetchedResultsController to make populating a sectioned UITableView easier. My issue is this: In all examples I have seen the instance NSFetchedResultsController is an ivar of the UITableViewController. This leads to all NSFetchedResults statements constructed within the UITableViewController. I feel like this is clutters the UITableViewController and adds another responsibility.

However, that causes the whole file to be bufferred into memory, and that becomes a problem for large (500MB) files. I've looked around for other functions that'll let me just buffer part of the file instead, but I haven't found any documentation specifically stating how the buffer works for those functions (I'm a bit new at this so maybe I'm missing the obvious). So far the best match I seem to have found is ReadFile. It seems to have a definable buffer but I'm not completely sure that there won't be another buffer implemented behind the scenes, like there is with CreateFileW.
