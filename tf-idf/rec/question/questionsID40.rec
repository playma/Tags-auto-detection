@TITLE:What's the fastest way to read/write to disk in .NET?
@CONTENT:I've got a little program that reads and writes files on disk. Breaking it down to the most simple level, it reads bytes from one file stream and writes them to another. It performs its duties fine, but it isn't the fastest thing. I've seen other applications that can tear through a gigabyte or more of reads/writes in amazing speeds. Obviously they're operating closer to the metal than a little .NET app. What are the most efficient .NET APIs for streaming to/from the disk? What win32 APIs are available (and worth p/invoking for) for speedy disk access?

@CONTENT:OK, this may be really simple, but it is Friday and it has been a long week. I can't seem to find an answer for the life of me. Basically, I have a project in which the Namespace Provider property has been set. When a colleague gets the up to date code from the repository, these properties do not seem to appear at all? (i.e. there is no "Namespace Provider" entry in the properties window).. What could be causing this? I am thinking he may need an update for VS2008 or something? I have never had issues with this/like this before! Ideas? :) Thanks a lot! Update We have now verified that the machine has VS2008 SP1 - Still no dice :( .. and we have completely deleted all the files in the folder and done another "GET" from the repo (crappy VSS) - I have a distinct feeling that there are some residual "web site" project files that were not deleted from the repo, and are causing VS to misinterpret the project type somehow.. Will let you know once I can prove :)

@CONTENT:It's hard enough to find reliable numbers as to general adoption of the .NET framework. This questions concerns an even more specific case: what's the situation among home users? I am wondering wether .NET is a good choice for a desktop application when targetting home users? Assuming the application in question is a small-medium sized app (download, install & run), and the size of the framework is considerably larger, having the user download and install the framework just for the sake of that application seems like a big thumbs-down. I know that Vista ships with .NET 3.0 out of the box (2003 ships with 1.1, but it's a server version), but that's just not enough considering that XP still has over 60% market share, including non-Windows systems (Accroding to hitslink.com, as of May this year). Here's another thing: I almost can't think of any home-user targetted software that uses .NET (There's Catalyst, what else?). Why is that? Is this a clue that the framework isn't really that popular among home users?

@CONTENT:I'm creating a Brainfuck parser (in a BASIC dialect) ultimately to create an interpreter but i've realise it's not as straight forward as i first thought. My problem is that i need a way to accurately parse the matching loop operators within a Brainfuck program. This is an example program: ,>,>++++++++[<------<------>>-]
<<[>[>+>+<<-]>>[<<+>>-]<<<-]
>>>++++++[<++++++++>-],<.>.
 '[' = start of loop ']' = end of loop I need to record the start and end point of each matching loop operator so i can jump around the source as needed. Some loops are alone, some are nested. What would be the best way to parse this? I was thinking maybe move through the source file creating a 2D array (or such like) recording the start and end positions of each matching operator, but this seems like a lot of 'to'ing and fro'ing' through the source. Is this the best way to do it? More info: Brainfuck homepage EDIT: Sample code in any language greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:In a recent interview, I was asked to implement a thread safe generic (i.e.template based) stack in C++, on linux machine. I quickly came up with the following (It may have compilation errors). I got through. The interviewer probably liked something in this implementation. Maybe the design part :) Here are a few problems that this implementation may have:- 1. Incorrect implementation to indicate overflow/underflow. There is no overflow handling since I'm using STL vector as the underlying data structure. Should there be any such handling? Also, underflow (in Pop()) yields false as return value. Should it be done by throwing of an exception? 2. Implementation of PopElem routine. Is the below implementation correct? 3. No real use of top element. 4. Better timing between start of writer and reader thread. Please make any comments/suggestions/improvements. Thanks. //Implementing a thread safe generic stack. #include<pthread.h>

I have a local repository and CodePlex has it's Internet repository for the project, and the two don't mix :-(. But my dear departed dad used to tell me that the difference between a clever man and a wise man is that the wise man does not enter the trap a clever man find his way out of. In other words: I must have been doing something wrong. So: Say you're a group of a few developers. There's a Subversion controlled project on the Internet you want to start modifying. You want to work on it locally, changing it to suit your needs. You want local version control. You want to control which Internet changes to accept to your repository - those that are relevant and important and don't cause noise. You want to commit to the Internet some of your local changes - those that you're sure that are stable, and that are relevant to the whole community. This method of operation seems to me common sense, but then I've never worked on an open source project. So: 1. Is this indeed a common method of operation and 2. How do you go about doing it with Subversion without getting into trouble?

@TITLE:How do I browse a Websphere MQ message without removing it?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a .NET Windows Forms application that will post a message to a Websphere MQ queue and then poll a different queue for a response. If a response is returned, the application will partially process the response in real time. But the response needs to stay in the queue so that a daily batch job, which also reads from the response queue, can do the rest of the processing. I've gotten as far as reading the message. What I haven't been able to figure out is how to read it without removing it. Here's what I've got so far. I'm an MQ newbie, so any suggestions will be appreciated. And feel free to respond in C#. Public Function GetMessage(ByVal msgID As String) As MQMessage
    Dim q = ConnectToResponseQueue()
    Dim msg As New MQMessage()
    Dim getOpts As New MQGetMessageOptions()
    Dim runThru = Now.AddMilliseconds(CInt(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("responseTimeoutMS")))
    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000) 'Wait for one second before checking for the first response'
    While True
        Try
            q.Get(msg, getOpts)
            Return msg
        Catch ex As MQException When ex.Reason = MQC.MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE
            If Now > runThru Then Throw ex
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(3000)
        Finally
            q.Close()
        End Try
    End While
    Return Nothing 'Should never reach here'
End Function
 NOTE: I haven't verified that my code actually removes the message. But that's how I understand MQ to work, and that appears to be what's happening. Please correct me if that's not the default behavior.
@CODE:Public Function GetMessage(ByVal msgID As String) As MQMessage

@TITLE:How do I debug silent failures in Java applications?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to debug a problem in my Java application that throws no errors, no exceptions and doesn't even crash the app (it seems the failure happens in a separate thread). The problem seems to be inside a call to a library function (it's JAXBContext.newInstance(String) if that matters). The program will reach the line just before the call, but not the one just after it. My catch blocks are not entered and the program just continues to run. The problem happens while trying to render an XML response to a web request that came in via Struts. The request has been handled and the code should marshal the response object. The client gets a response right away (so the code doesn't seem to hang in a loop), but it's just empty. I have set a breakpoint just before the problematic line but the debugger just runs over it, I haven't a clue why. I'm using eclipse and the application runs inside an OSGi container (Apache Felix) that was started with -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y. From within Eclipse I then use the Debug settings for "Remote Java application" to connect the debugger. What are techniques to get at such a problem?

@TITLE:How to check out a CVS branch point?
@CONTENT:First, I have to admit I screwed up a little with CVS. I had a release tag releaseX, which was done some time back (i.e., not HEAD). Then I decided I need a maintenance branch at that point. Instead of creating a branch tag (branchX) in addition to releaseX, I deleted the release tag and created a branch tag (erroneously) named releaseX. I then proceeded to work on that maintenance branch, and created releaseX1, releaseX2 etc. My problem: when I check out releaseX, I get the branch head, i.e. the latest code from that branch. What I need now is the code at the branch point, i.e. the former releaseX code. Is there any way to do this? Reverting to earlier repository version from backup is not an option. Edit: I know I can work around it by doing a date-based checkout. I would like to know if it's possible to still do a tag-based one. Update (Re @Philip Derbeko): I know that CVS does not correlate between files. But CVS does have the information where the branch occured. In ViewVC, I can even see it: File X - Revision 1.y - Branch: MAIN - Branch point for: releaseX The next file revision is: File X - Revision 1.y.2.1 - Branch: releaseX - CVS Tags: releaseX1 The metadata is apparently there. Hence my question: Is it possible to check out the branch point, not the branch HEAD?
@CODE:releaseX branchX releaseX releaseX releaseX1 releaseX2 releaseX releaseX File X - Revision 1.y - Branch: MAIN - Branch point for: releaseX File X - Revision 1.y.2.1 - Branch: releaseX - CVS Tags: releaseX1

I can't "AddHandler" in the Load of the first object, because an instance of the second object doesn't exist yet.

I'm also open to another recommendation about how to do this instead. If I do my AddHandler in Object1.Load, and Object2 doesn't exist yet, then it will never handle my event, even if I create it later. Right now, in the code that fires the event, I've just resorted to doing a RemoveHandler and then an AddHandler every single time the event is raised, and then I know I'll attach when the object finally exists, but I know this is a crappy method. I saw an article about something similar (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/660480/determine-list-of-event-handlers-bound-to-event), and maybe I'm missing something in the translation, but I can't get the code to work on my custom event in VB.NET.

My idea was to build a tool with a web-gui that allows translators to work directly on cvs module (checkout in background and commit on "save", maybe tagging in background). We started with implementation by trainees and got something like a proof of concept. Before we go on with development I'd like to know Second question: Do you know of a comparable tool? and/or Third question: Would you use such a tool?

@TITLE:Sharepoint Search Property Weighting
@CONTENT:I'm using the code listed here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms553069.aspx With an additional line added as a call to .update() after the property is set in order to save the changes, but even with a weight of 10,000 the search results for my property are still at the bottom, particularly below title. Is there some other things that need to be done in order to get the weighting to propogate? I've also tried setting the title, author, and filename to 0, setting the property (keywords) to 9999, and setting length normalization of the property to 0. The results shift a bit, but searches with keywords that match the property still do not match. All tests were done with a full crawl afterwards, reset IIS, and recycle the shared services app pool. I can give you any extra information you might request. Thanks, Stefan UPDATE (6-19-09): Added a bounty of 500 to this. Very little information about this feature available online, apparently a good answer would a huge service to the internet community. It'd probably save me a week too :) UPDATE 2 (6-19-09): The schema is essentially this: OOB sharepoint document content type with added text field "Keywords". Managed property attached to ows_keywords(Text). UPDATE 3 (6-19-09): Sharepoint Search Bench from Codeplex has helped the search a lot. UPDATE 4 (6-19-09): I've arrived at a solution that involves creating many (5 right now) more managed properties with the same crawled property. Each weight is set to something unusual (like 9999). These do enough to buoy the keyword results to the top. Less than ideal though. Still looking for a solution. The solution in Update 4 is what I ended up with. As Lars commented, the search is not very flexible and despite offering tweaks to the property weightings, the effect is not always what you would expect.

@CONTENT:In our company we have a huge project with lots of tables. When I mean a lot it is about 500. Maybe it is something normal. Some of these tables have more than 200 fields. I find that trying to make an E-R Diagram for the whole system will be confusing, tiring and useless. Just including the tables would result in a frightening list of boxes. Not to mention the relations that will flow like spaguetti. How do you document those projects? Is there any technique for divide and conquer the structure of a project? By the way we use Microsoft Visio and our servers run Oracle. Update: As everybody said we all agree that a 500-table ERD will be useless and needs to be broken up in pieces. The method of grouping tables in sub-diagrams is something much more interesting. How many tables are too much? What If I can't find clear routes for the relations? Is there any strategy or heuristic that may help?

@TITLE:Is there a right way to return a new object instance by reference in C++?
@CONTENT:So I was writing some code, and I had something like this: class Box

    public:
    //...
    Rectangle & GetRect( void ) const
    {
        return Rectangle( x, y, w, h );
    }
};
 Then later in some code: Rectangle rect = theBox.GetRect();
 Which worked in my debug build, but in release there were "issues" returning that Rectangle by reference -- I basically got an uninitialized rectangle. The Rectangle class has an = operator and a copy constructor. Without getting into why this broke, I'm actually more interested in the correct way to return a (new) object by reference for the purpose of assigning copying to a variable. Am I just being silly? Should it not be done? I know I can return a pointer and then dereference on assignment, but I'd rather not. Some part of me feels like returning by value would result in redundant copying of the object -- does the compiler figure that out and optimize it? It seems like a trivial question. I feel almost embarrassed I don't know this after many years of C++ coding so hopefully someone can clear this up for me. :)

@TITLE:How does PPP or Ethernet recover from errors?
@CONTENT:Looking at the data-link level standards, such as PPP general frame format or Ethernet, it's not clear what happens if the checksum is invalid. How does the protocol know where the next frame begins? Does it just scan for the next occurrence of "flag" (in the case of PPP)? If so, what happens if the packet payload just so happens to contain "flag" itself? My point is that, whether packet-framing or "length" fields are used, it's not clear how to recover from invalid packets where the "length" field could be corrupt or the "framing" bytes could just so happen to be part of the packet payload. UPDATE: I found what I was looking for (which isn't strictly what I asked about) by looking up "GFP CRC-based framing". According to Communication networks The GFP receiver synchronizes to the GFP frame boundary through a three-state process. The receiver is initially in the hunt state where it examines four bytes at a time to see if the CRC computed over the first two bytes equals the contents of the next two bytes. If no match is found the GFP moves forward by one byte as GFP assumes octet synchronous transmission given by the physical layer. When the receiver finds a match it moves to the pre-sync state. While in this intermediate state the receiver uses the tentative PLI (payload length indicator) field to determine the location of the next frame boundary. If a target number N of successful frame detection has been achieved, then the receiver moves into the sync state. The sync state is the normal state where the receiver examines each PLI, validates it using cHEC (core header error checking), extracts the payload, and proceeds to the next frame. In short, each packet begins with "length" and "CRC(length)". There is no need to escape any characters and the packet length is known ahead of time. There seems to be two major approaches to packet framing: encoding schemes (bit/byte stuffing, Manchester encoding, 4b5b, 8b10b, etc) unmodified data + checksum (GFP) The former is safer, the latter is more efficient. Both are prone to errors if the payload just happens to contain a valid packet and line corruption causes the proceeding bytes to contain the "start of frame" byte sequence but that sounds highly improbable. It's difficult to find hard numbers for GFP's robustness, but a lot of modern protocols seem to use it so one can assume that they know what they're doing.

@TITLE:How to send a SIGINT to Python from a bash script?
@CONTENT:I want to launch a background Python job from a bash script and then gracefully kill it with SIGINT. This works fine from the shell, but I can't seem to get it to work in a script. loop.py: #! /usr/bin/env python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        print 'starting loop'
        while True:
            pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print 'quitting loop'
 From the shell I can interrupt it: $ python loop.py &
[1] 15420
starting loop
$ kill -SIGINT 15420
quitting loop
[1]+  Done                    python loop.py
 kill.sh: #! /bin/bash
python loop.py &
PID=$!
echo "sending SIGINT to process $PID"
kill -SIGINT $PID
 But from a script I can't: $ ./kill.sh 
starting loop
sending SIGINT to process 15452
$ ps ax | grep loop.py | grep -v grep
15452 pts/3    R      0:08 python loop.py
 And, if it's been launched from a script I can no longer kill it from the shell: $ kill -SIGINT 15452
$ ps ax | grep loop.py | grep -v grep
15452 pts/3    R      0:34 python loop.py
 I'm assuming I'm missing some fine point of bash job control.

    insert into test1 values (i);
  end loop;

@LINK:/questions/965423/c-sharp-generic-overload-compiler-cant-determine-correct-call
@TITLE:C# generic overload - Compiler can't determine correct call
@CONTENT:I don't understand why the compiler can't resolve the correct overload to use here. (code below) There is only one version of Add() that is appropriate- BigFoo is an IFoo, and does not implement IEnumerable where T is an IFoo. But it insists on reporting an ambiguity. Any ideas? I tried adding a second generic type parameter- Add where T : IFoo where U : IEnumerable. But then the overload is completely ignored even for legitimate use. I know I can work around this with casting and specifying generic type parameters but at that point I've defeated the purpose of having an overload. You could question the overload, but the semantics feel correct to me- the behavior I'm implementing in my class is for both Add() to add the object wholesale as an individual entry in the collection. (the second Add() is not supposed to be an AddRange().) namespace NS
{
  interface IFoo { }

  class BigFoo : IFoo, IEnumerable<int>
  {
    public IEnumerator<int> GetEnumerator()
    {
      throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    {
      throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
  }

  {

@TITLE:Naming methods that are registered to events
@CONTENT:Assume that I have a class that exposes the following event: public event EventHandler Closing
 How should methods that are registered to this event be named? Do you prefer to follow the convention that Visual Studio uses when it assigns names to the methods it generates (aka. +=, Tab, Tab)? For example: private void TheClass_Closing( object sender, EventArgs e )
 Or do you use your own style to name these methods? I've tried different ways to name these methods (like TheClassClosing, HandleClosing, etc.). But I haven't found a good style to indicate that the intent of a method is to handle a registered event. I personally don't like the style (underscore) that Visual Studio uses to generate method names. I know that registered event-handling methods are always private and that there is no naming convention like the one for methods that raise events (e.g., OnClosing).

@TITLE:Get available screen area in autohotkey
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a few simple AutoHotkey scripts for moving windows around, and I'm having trouble getting the correct screen size values. I'm trying to get the size of the usable area on the screen (generally the full screen resolution minus the taskbar, and maybe any other docked windows like the sidebar in Vista). Neither of the methods I've found for getting the screen width seems to work. None of the 3 methods I found to get the screen size are giving me the right values. Here's the test script I'm using (running on XP with the taskbar on the bottom at its default size): #7::
WinMove A,,0,0,A_ScreenWidth,A_ScreenHeight
return

#8::
;SM_CXMAXIMIZED and SM_CYMAXIMIZED
SysGet, ScreenWidth, 61
SysGet, ScreenHeight, 62
WinMove A,,0,0,ScreenWidth,ScreenHeight
return

#9::
;SM_CXFULLSCREEN and SM_CYFULLSCREEN
SysGet, ScreenWidth, 16
SysGet, ScreenHeight, 17
WinMove A,,0,0,ScreenWidth,ScreenHeight
return
 #7 causes the window to take up the entire resolution, so it overlaps the taskbar. #8 causes the width to be larger than the resolution (I see the window's right edge show up on my secondary monitor) and the height is slightly too large, so the window partially overlaps the taskbar area. Looks like this is correct except for not taking into account the window decorations at the edges. #9 seems to have the correct width, but the height is too short. It looks like it's subtracting the taskbar's height from the resolution's height, but then subtracting another 30 pixels from it. I could just use what I have in #9 and add 30 to the height I get, but that feels too much like a hack that would break in other configurations. It seems like there has to be a way to get the available screen size properly, but I can't find it in AutoHotkey. For reference, this seems to give me what I need in Java: Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();
@CODE:#7::
WinMove A,,0,0,A_ScreenWidth,A_ScreenHeight
return

#8::
;SM_CXMAXIMIZED and SM_CYMAXIMIZED
SysGet, ScreenWidth, 61
SysGet, ScreenHeight, 62
WinMove A,,0,0,ScreenWidth,ScreenHeight
return

#9::

@CONTENT:I've been exploring the use of custom functions for event handlers. In this stripped down example, I'm trying to get an alert to pop up when the user clicks a button. But the alert box pops up immediately as the page loads! What am I doing wrong? ( the commented portion does the exact same thing). If I define the bclick() function like function bclick(foo, bar){ ... }
 The result is also the same. JS in the header: <script type="text/javascript">

var bclick = function(foo, bar){alert( foo + "  " + bar + "\n");}

//$(document).ready(function(){

$("button").click(bclick("Button","Clicked"));

@TITLE:How to fool git-svn to recognize merges made with svn?
@CONTENT:We have an SVN setup with stable trunk and unstable development branch. Dev work is (mostly) done on the branch and then merged to trunk before deployment. I use git-svn as my SVN client. My merge process from unstable to trunk is as follows: git svn fetch
git co -b trunk svn/trunk 
git merge --no-ff svn/unstable
git svn dcommit
 svn/* are the remote SVN branches. This of course requires that no one commits anything to the trunk before I am done, but this is not a problem in practice. The benefits of this process is that git now records the parents of the merge commit in my local repository. This does not benefit my coworkers, but it does allow git to compute the common ancestor when I do the merge. This is very desirable. And here is the rub. When someone else makes a merge, git doesn't know about it. Here is an example:   o-...-A---o---C--- unstable
 /
X--...--B---o---o--- stable
 The unstable branch was created at point X. At point A we decide to merge changes from the unstable branch into the stable branch at point B. The common ancestor is correctly X. Because the merge is not recorded in the git history, the following merge at C again assumes X is the common ancestor. I would like it be A, as in the following graph:   o-...-A---o---C--- unstable
 /       \
X---...---B---o---o--- stable
 It is not absolutely necessary to get a graph that looks exacly like the one pictured. Any graph, which would recognize A as the common ancestor is fine by me. I have some options in mind, such as a proper use of git-filter-branch or a "fake" commit which is never dcommited to SVN. However none of my attempts have worked sufficiently so far. I am grateful for any ideas you can present. The procedure does not have to be automatic. The merges are pretty rare and I can live with the pain of doing it "by hand".
@CODE:git svn fetch
git co -b trunk svn/trunk 
git merge --no-ff svn/unstable
git svn dcommit svn/* o-...-A---o---C--- unstable

 And as you might or might not imagine - it chokes the mysql server to a standstill... What it does is - it simply pulls the number of new users who signed up, have at least one "completed" payment, tm_completed is not empty (as it is only populated for completed payments), and (the embedded Select) that member has never had a "completed" payment before - meaning he's a new member (just because the system does rebills and whatnot, and this is the only way to sort of differentiate between an existing member who just got rebilled and a new member who got billed for the first time). Now, is there any possible way to optimize this query to use less resources or something, and to stop taking my mysql resources down on their knees...? Am I missing any info to clarify this any further? Let me know...

 I'm pretty sure this leaks. What I'm really asking is: is there any "magic" in MFC that does dialog cleanup when the dialog is destroyed. How would it work if dlg wasn't a pointer but declared on the stack - wouldn't the destructor destroy the window when dlg goes out of scope.

@TITLE:How to fool git-svn to recognize merges made with svn?
@CONTENT:We have an SVN setup with stable trunk and unstable development branch. Dev work is (mostly) done on the branch and then merged to trunk before deployment. I use git-svn as my SVN client. My merge process from unstable to trunk is as follows: git svn fetch
git co -b trunk svn/trunk 
git merge --no-ff svn/unstable
git svn dcommit
 svn/* are the remote SVN branches. This of course requires that no one commits anything to the trunk before I am done, but this is not a problem in practice. The benefits of this process is that git now records the parents of the merge commit in my local repository. This does not benefit my coworkers, but it does allow git to compute the common ancestor when I do the merge. This is very desirable. And here is the rub. When someone else makes a merge, git doesn't know about it. Here is an example:   o-...-A---o---C--- unstable
 /
X--...--B---o---o--- stable
 The unstable branch was created at point X. At point A we decide to merge changes from the unstable branch into the stable branch at point B. The common ancestor is correctly X. Because the merge is not recorded in the git history, the following merge at C again assumes X is the common ancestor. I would like it be A, as in the following graph:   o-...-A---o---C--- unstable
 /       \
X---...---B---o---o--- stable
 It is not absolutely necessary to get a graph that looks exacly like the one pictured. Any graph, which would recognize A as the common ancestor is fine by me. I have some options in mind, such as a proper use of git-filter-branch or a "fake" commit which is never dcommited to SVN. However none of my attempts have worked sufficiently so far. I am grateful for any ideas you can present. The procedure does not have to be automatic. The merges are pretty rare and I can live with the pain of doing it "by hand".
@CODE:git svn fetch
git co -b trunk svn/trunk 
git merge --no-ff svn/unstable
git svn dcommit svn/* o-...-A---o---C--- unstable

X--...--B---o---o--- stable o-...-A---o---C--- unstable

@CONTENT:Ok, here's a query that I am running right now on a table that has 45,000 records and is 65MB in size... and is just about to get bigger and bigger (so I gotta think of the future performance as well here): SELECT count(payment_id) as signup_count, sum(amount) as signup_amount
FROM payments p
WHERE tm_completed BETWEEN '2009-05-01' AND '2009-05-30'

 And as you might or might not imagine - it chokes the mysql server to a standstill... What it does is - it simply pulls the number of new users who signed up, have at least one "completed" payment, tm_completed is not empty (as it is only populated for completed payments), and (the embedded Select) that member has never had a "completed" payment before - meaning he's a new member (just because the system does rebills and whatnot, and this is the only way to sort of differentiate between an existing member who just got rebilled and a new member who got billed for the first time). Now, is there any possible way to optimize this query to use less resources or something, and to stop taking my mysql resources down on their knees...? Am I missing any info to clarify this any further? Let me know... EDIT: Here are the indexes already on that table: PRIMARY PRIMARY 46757 payment_id member_id INDEX 23378 member_id payer_id INDEX 11689 payer_id coupon_id INDEX 1 coupon_id tm_added INDEX 46757 tm_added, product_id tm_completed INDEX 46757 tm_completed, product_id

@TITLE:How to use JPL (bidirectional Java/Prolog interface) on windows?
@CONTENT:I'm interested in embedding a Prolog interpreter in Java. One option is using JPL, but the download links on the JPL site are broken, and the installation page mentions a jpl.zip that I can't find. I downloaded SWI-Prolog which seems to include JPL (it lists it as a component when installing), but I'm still not sure how I'd use it along with Java. Any ideas on how to use JPL on Windows? Is there another library I could use to achieve the same thing? I've come across a few but they don't seem as stable as JPL.

@CONTENT:I have the following code to animate the showing/hiding of a div. $(".headerClosed, .headerOpen").live("click", function(){

 This shows and hides a div with the following markup: <div class="details">
  <p>Date</p>
  <p>Text</p>
</div>
 The problem is in IE(surprise, surprise!) when the div slides down the animation is smooth until the end when it jerks. I know this is due to the padding/margin settings of the div. If I use a <div> instead of <p> then the animation is smooth, but as soon as I add any padding or margin to the <div> then the animation jerks. How can you slide down a nice looking div with spacing if the padding and margin settings make it jerk?

product.ToHtml();  // or: HtmlRenderer.Render(Product);
 but my main problem is how to do this stuff from behind. I have 3 different answers: 1. Render By Code: I can simply write my code for rendering the Html inside the ToHtml Method (C#) - the problem it is that it is too static. if you would like to move a little bit the header to the middle you should change code. moreover, it is very hard to read Html indentation in C#. 2. Using XSL: XSL Files can easily manage the Html template and using XSLT I can transform XML file to the right place of the documents. the parser already written by someone else (just need to learn the syntax) ** for this we will need that each object could serialize to Xml. and if the object changed -> the Xml will be changed --> the xslt need to be changed too ** this will also give me the option to indent the html easily for example: adding css capabilities and\or change the html design 3. using other template engine: Write my own C# -> Html template Engine so it will read the template from file (*.template) and will insert the right property in the right place of the template using reflection. ** in this solution we have many issues that we can think of, for example: how the syntax should be like? is this thing ok? %Name% %Description% and how we can handle arrays? ** maybe we can use an existing engine (Brail or T4-Templating)? What do you prefer? do you know a good engine? for now I prefer the second solution, but it gonna be very slow. thanks

 used with same text "1=2" will find an unnamed group with value "1=2". I understood that regexp engine treats "(" and ")" that encloses groups "a" and "b" as an unnamed group and reports that it is found. But i don't want an unnamed groups to be reported, i just want to use "|" in order to "glue" multiple regexps together. Without creating any parasitic unnamed groups. Is it a way to do so in python?

@CONTENT:All Points are Vectors, and all Vectors are Points. All Directions are Vectors, NOT all Vectors are Directions (this shouldn't mean both way conversion shouldn't be allowed). I want to have the operators overridden once for all preferably since they're all completely identical. In C++ I can just define class Vector { float x,y,z; }, and do typedef Point = Vector, typedef Direction = Vector; In C# there is no equivalent ("using Point=Vector;" sucks as you have to place it in every single document you use, and it's not enforced by the compiler). I tried to define 3 different classes and override the operators for each, then do implicit type casting which would make the code run slower, etc. I tried defining just Vector, then Point:Vector and Direction:Vector, this way I only write the operators once but then I can't do implicit type casting Point <-> Vector or Direction <->Vector. I could simply define the Vector class and use that everywhere, but that would create ambiguity as to weather a variable is supposed to be a position in space (Point), a relative position in space (Vector) or a unit vector (Direction). For example the function: Vector GetOrthogon(Vector a, Vector b) {
    // ....
}
 You can't know whether it's expecting any vectors or unit vectors. In C++ you could do that, so why not in C#? Note: having structs instead of classes would be ideal if possible.

For the nested ones, I found these two tutorials to be helpful http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/1/26/nested-model-forms http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=717 My questions are: In the case of a non-nested model, how to handle multiple entries for the second model? Just run a loop, and use fields_for? In both nested/non-nested cases, how to validate for duplicate values, when there are multiple entries for the second model? For example, if project is the primary and task is the secondary (child) model, and the user adds multiple tasks for the project, how to make sure there aren't duplicate tasks added, for that particular model? One way would be to loop through the text values, and check for duplicates. Is there a better way to do it, at the object level, instead of string level?

@TITLE:C++ std::vector of pointers deletion and segmentation faults
@CONTENT:I have a vector of pointers to a class. I need to call their destructors and free their memory. Since they are vector of pointers vector.clear() does not do the job.So I went on to do it manually like so : void Population::clearPool(std::vector<Chromosome*> a,int size)
{
    Chromosome* c;
    for(int j = 0 ;j < size-1;j++)
    {
       c = a.back();

       delete c;
       printf("  %d \n\r",j);
       c = NULL;

    }

}
 The printf in there is since I have a talking destructor to see in which Chromosome the segmentation fault happens. When clearPool() is called and say we got a size of 100, it can give a segmentation fault in any Chromosome between 0 and 100. I have no idea why this might be happening nor do I have a way to actually find what's wrong since while debugging with breakpoints all I see is that it happens in there at random chromosomes. I am using codeblocks IDE and the gdb debugger. The stack trace when the segmentation fault happens has 4 memory addresses and a function wsncpy().
@CODE:void Population::clearPool(std::vector<Chromosome*> a,int size)
{
    Chromosome* c;

@TITLE:How to make a wxFrame behave like a modal wxDialog object
@CONTENT:Is is possible to make a wxFrame object behave like a modal dialog box in that the window creating the wxFrame object stops execution until the wxFrame object exits? I'm working on a small game and have run into the following problem. I have a main program window that hosts the main application (strategic portion). Occasionally, I need to transfer control to a second window for resolution of part of the game (tactical portion). While in the second window, I want the processing in the first window to stop and wait for completion of the work being done in the second window. Normally a modal dialog would do the trick but I want the new window to have some functionality that I can't seem to get with a wxDialog, namely a status bar at the bottom and the ability to resize/maximize/minimize the window (this should be possible but doesn't work, see this question How to get the minimize and maximize buttons to appear on a wxDialog object). As an addition note, I want the second window's functionality needs to stay completely decoupled from the primary window as it will be spun off into a separate program eventually. Has anyone done this or have any suggestions?

@TITLE:Enable mod_deflate to send Content-Encoding: gzip
@CONTENT:EDIT I have found that the problem is actually php minify. This was sending the deflated content instead of Apache. I'll find more on this. According to High Performance Web Sites, if I enable mod_deflate in Apache 2.x, by adding the following line, it should send gzipped/delfated content: - AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/css application/x-javascript
 The book also says that gzip is more effective than deflate. I have enabled in httpd.conf by adding the same line. But Apache sends Content-Encoding: deflate. I tested with CURL using: - curl -i -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" "http://192.168.1.33/s.js" >> e:\curl_log.txt
 It returns 'gzipped' content. But when I send the command: - curl -i -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" "http://192.168.1.33/s.js" >> e:\curl_log.txt
 It returns 'deflated' content. So, if the browser supports both deflated and gzipped, Apache send deflated. How to tell Apache to prefer gzip over deflate? FYI: - I could not find anything in: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html. There is no occurrence of no-gzip in the Apache conf. Server: Apache/2.2.9 (Win32) PHP/5.2.6 FF sends request header as: "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"

@TITLE:HOWTO: Call Managed C# Interface From Unmanged C++ On WindowsCE Compact Framework
@CONTENT:I have extensive unmanaged Windows CE 5 C++ code that provides a UI that I want to use in a new product by combining it with a large amount of newer business and communications logic written in managed C# on Windows CE 6 and the Compact Framework. The UI may know about the business logic, but I want the business logic ignorant of the UI such that I can later replace it with a managed version, or any other UI that I choose as a front-end. I found an article that describes how to use COM as the bridge in the Windows world, but I'm having difficulty applying it in the .NET CF under WinCE. In the past, I've imported type libraries and used COM calls (CoInitialize(), CoCreateInstance()) to obtain pointers to interfaces on other Windows platforms, and that's the strategy I'm pursuing at the moment: using COM directly in the unmanaged C++ library to access the C# interfaces in my managed library, assuming that the same facility is provided in WinCE. Here's my problem: the typelib. It's not available from my managed C# library as I've used it in the past via a '#import "SomeCPPLibrary.dll"' statement. I believe it's buried in the .dll assembly, stored in a different manner than it has been in the past and hence, not directly available through a #import of the library itself. I think that I can #import a typelib, but I cannot find a way to extract the typelib from my managed .dll, and while I might be able to hack together an interface definition file (.idl) and use the platform's midl.exe to generate a .tlb from it, there's no guarantee that my .idl, and hence, resulting .tlb, would really match what is in my C# .dll. I don't even know if the platform midl.exe works in this manner but assume that it does. Am I barking up the wrong tree? Is it possible to use a managed C# interface in unmanaged C++ through a corresponding COM interface? Does setting the [assembly: ComVisible(true)] attribute in its AssemblyInfo.cs file make all interfaces in the managed assembly available through COM in the unmanaged world via the GUID the AssemblyInfo.cs defines, or do I have to do something more? How do I get the typelib out of the managed .dll so that my unmanaged C++ library can #import it? I tried adding my managed C# library project as a reference in the unmanaged C++ library project, but that didn't seem to help. Is such a reference relevant at all in this situation? Is there a better approach to solving the basic problem of calling managed C# code from the unmanaged C++ world? Something I just read about here is a mixed mode libarary with a managed translation layer to bridge the unmanaged/managed gap. I'm not sure that is a good strategy as call response speed is an important factor, but might it be better in the long run as I plan to rewrite the UI to managed C# at some point, and thus puts all the effort on the throw-away UI rather than mucking with the more permanent business/comms logic? Regardless of the answer to this question, I'd still like to solve the problem of using COM, if for no other reason than curiosity. Thanks for any insight you (collectively) can provide. james

@TITLE:Display current line and column number for a textarea
@CONTENT:I'm making a file edit interface in my web-app, I have a textarea with file contents. When textarea is focused, I want to output the position of the cursor, i.e. line number and column: this is useful because error messages usually yield a line number, for example. The question is: how do I figure out the position of the cursor in textarea? I'm using prototype library. Maybe there's a solution already? I'm not really interested in fancy toolbars for the textarea, which are offered by those advanced widgets.

@LINK:/questions/845233/parsing-a-string-containing-escaped-characters-using-java
@TITLE:Parsing a string containing escaped characters using Java
@CONTENT:Hello I wonder if someone could help me figure out how to parse a string having the following format: ;field1-field2-fieldN;field1-field2-fieldN;
 Each record is delimited by ';' and each field within a record is delimited by '-'. The complication is that the individual fields may contain escaped delimiter characters like so "\;" or "-". This causes my simple parsing code below to fail. So what I'm trying to do is come up with regex expressions that will match the delimiters but not match the escaped delimiters. My regex knowledge is not that great but I expected there must be a way of combining "([^\;])" and "([;])" to get what I require. public static List<ParsedRecord> parse(String data) {
    List<ParsedRecord> parsedRecords = new List<ParsedRecord>();
    String[] records = data.split(";");
    for (String record : records) {
        String[] fields = data.split("-");
        parsedRecords.add(new parsedRecord(fields));
    }
    return parsedRecords;
}
 Thanks very much in advance.

@TITLE:How is ¡§0¡¨ result from readdir() not false in a while condition?
@CONTENT:See also: Where in the documentation does it say that while tests readdir for definedness?. (Not a duplicate; just closely related.) Many people treat the loop below as idiomatic: while (defined(my $file = readdir($dir)) {
    ...
}
 instead of: while (my $file = readdir($dir)) {
    ...
}
 because supposedly with the latter version if the filename is just "0" (zero) it should terminate the loop, whereas it returns 'undef' when there are no more files. However at some point in the past this test for defined() stopped being necessary - there appears to be special case code that allows the latter version to work regardless. I'd like to know how this works? Curiously,if I replace the call to readdir() with a call to foo() instead: sub foo
{
    my ($dir) = @_;
    return readdir($dir);
}

while (my $file = foo($dir)) {
    ...
}
 then the code does do what I'd expect, and terminate the loop when a file named "0" is found. (tested with Perl 5.8.9 on MacOS X 10.5.6)
@CODE:while (defined(my $file = readdir($dir)) {
    ...
} while (my $file = readdir($dir)) {
    ...
} defined() readdir() foo() sub foo
{
    my ($dir) = @_;

}

@TITLE:Picking good identifier names
@CONTENT:Ok, so you can read guidelines on identifier naming 'til you're blue in the face... camel case, pascal case, make 'em descriptive... but they won't help you actually pick the best name for a given application domain. The easiest to choose (IMHO) are one or two word noun groups: EntryForm Employee WidgetCollection But not every class fits neatly into a noun so I see a lot of people turn verbs into nouns by adding -er to the end of them: AccountManager RecordCounter ProcessRunner The biggest problem I see with these is that a lot of time they're ambiguous... especially Manager. What exactly is it managing? So my question is how do you pick a good name for a class? By 'good' I mean informative and unambiguous. I know, I know. With refactoring support built into pretty much every modern IDE you can change the name without batting an eye so what's the point? Well a poorly chosen name will confuse and mislead anyone who stumbles across it until it's renamed so its still a valid question. Related What¡¦s the best approach to naming classes?

@TITLE:Creating an xml file from xsd in .NET
@CONTENT:I would like to know the best method for solving this problem: I would like to create a blank template xml from a xml schema. All the required elements and attributes would be created and their values would be all empty strings. The next step is how to determine which child xml nodes a certain node could have. eg. I would select a node has has minOccurs="0", maxOccurs="unbounded" for one of its children. I would be able to determine everything about that child, its attributes, its name, its value type, etc. To give more context on the situation, I am working on a tool that allows users to edit xml files in a more user friendly setting. For eg, They could add a new account to the 'account db' node and they would see that the only available node is an account node. Next, when they try to add children to the account node and the choices would be name node (required), password node (required), settings node (optional), etc. How do I determine programmatically what children the account node has available to it and what the attributes and settings are on those children? This is in C# 2.0 with .NET 2.0. In summary, which classes do I use to read a schema and parse it to get useful information for creating a xml? In my naivety I had hope that since xsd was xml in itself there would be some sort of DOM model that I could traverse through. I would like this to be confined to my program so no use of external tools such as OxygenXml, VS, xsd.exe, etc.

@TITLE:Should multiple projects have multiple TFS workspaces?
@CONTENT:We migrated from VSS to TFS about 6 months ago. Our way of storing projects was that we grouped them by category (Windows App, Web App, Infopath, SQLScripts, deprecated). Under the 'Windows App' workspace we might have 3 .NET projects. The 'Web App' might have 3, etc, etc. VSS was used more just to store the code repository than any real functionality VSS might provide. Windows App ($/Windows App/ workspace) -->App1 -->App2 -->App3 Web App ($/Web App/ workspace) -->App1 -->App2 -->App3 The question I have is would it be better to have 1 workspace for EACH project? One of the reasons I think for 'yes' is that if I am working on multiple projects in the same workspace when I do things like check in pending changes it will show me ALL of the pending changes including other projects I might not be currently working in. Web App/App1 ($/Web App/App1 workspace) Web App/App2 ($/Web App/App2 workspace) Web App/App3 ($/Web App/App3 workspace) I guess I'm looking for a best practices response. thanks.

 And my application launches as expected. If I create a web page that has a link of that type, it works as expected (I get a warning from the browser, but that's no problem). My issue comes when I try and send an email from my program containing one of these links. Gmail, in particular, seems to be stripping out my link, so when I send an email that contains this link: <a href='foo:1_1'>foo</a>
 I'm left with this resulting HTML: <a>foo</a>
 It seems to be stripping out my href tag, which I'm guessing is because it doesn't recognize the protocol. Does anyone have any idea how I can get around this?

@TITLE:Change radio button name javascript not working in IE
@CONTENT:I have a few radiobuttons in a jsp page. I run a javascript method once the page is loaded that seeks for certain radio buttons and change its name so they work like a radio group. I'm doing it this way because the radio buttons are inside jsf table and I have no access to the name property when coding and I want all of the radio buttons work like a radio group. Anyways the script run without problems and the radio buttons' names are changed properly. But while this works in FF 3 (the work like a radio group) it doesn't work in IE 6 or IE7 though they have the same 'name' property. Does anyone know how can I solve this? function setRadioGroup (nombreRadio){
    var listaRadios = document.getElementsByTagName('input');
    var tam = listaRadios.length;
    for (i = 0; i < tam; i++){
        if (listaRadios[i].type == 'radio' && listaRadios[i].title == 'Seleccionar'){
        listaRadios[i].name = nombreRadio;
       }
    }
}

@TITLE:If I topologically sort a DAG, can I drop half the adjacency matrix?
@CONTENT:I think I have understood a particular situation as described below, but I lack the theoretical knowledge to conduct a proof and I couldn't find any source that mentions it. If my understanding is correct, I can save half the space on my adjacency matrix, if it isn't I'm likely to have pretty weird bugs. So I'd like to be sure, and I'd appreciate if someone with a more solid background could review my reasoning. Say I represent a DAG of n vertices in an n * n adjacency matrix such that the entry i,j is 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j, 0 otherwise. Because the graph is directed and acyclic, it follows that, if i,j = 1, then j,i = 0. If I now sort the nodes in the matrix such that the topological level of the node at in is equal to or greater than the node at in-1, then it seems to me that half of the adjacency matrix will always only contain 0s, as it is the case in the following example: 
      V 1           V 2     from V    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
      / \           / \

 I cannot decide. On the one hand, I feel that it is redundant to name the variables in both the declaration (.h) and the definition (.cpp). Especially since you have to worry about updating the names in both places so that they match. On the other hand, without names, it can often be confusing to determine what variables the parameters correspond to just by looking at the declaration. So, what are your thoughts?

@TITLE:Why does my Visual Studio Win32 project require .NET 3.5 SP1 to install?
@CONTENT:Using Visual Studio 2008, I created a C++ Win32 project. To release the program, I made a Visual Studio setup project within the same solution. The setup.exe prompts my users to install .NET 3.5 SP1, which is often a 15+ minute install and only allowed to administrator level accounts. If they do not there is an error along the lines of "wrong framework". I am confused over what in my project requires .NET 3.5 SP1. I suspect just because that is the framework my PC is on... Is there a way to broaden which frameworks it will run on? The code is mostly Win32 API calls. Just in case, here are my dependencies and #includes: gdiplus.lib
comctl32.lib
Winmm.lib
d3d9.lib

 My guess is that somewhere through windows.h there is a WIN_VER or similar version setting that is set to .NET 3.5 SP1, and this is where the dependency comes from. If that is the case, and I need to define a different version, I would love to hear everyone's advice on does / don'ts / and how-to and how far back can I go for maximum inclusion.

@TITLE:Using an HTML snippet for a template in JavaScript (jQuery)
@CONTENT:I currently am working on a little app that requests user info from my server and displays them using a special template. At first, I just hardcoded the little snippet in jQuery:  $("<li><div class='outer'><table><tr><td rowspan=2 class='imgcontainer'><img class='thumb'/></td><td><span class='username'/></td></tr><tr><td><span class='name'/></td></tr></table></div></li>")
 I clone it several times. It's ugly and I want it to have syntax highlighting and whatnot, so it would be better for me to have it in the HTML file itself. Also, it will make merges easier so somebody can just change a line or two. Is there a pattern for this? Am I OK putting it in the HTML file that I include this JS in (there's only one), and making it hidden using CSS. The third option I thought of is just creating a separate HTML file and having jQuery request that from the server to keep it separate. Is this technique used much? Also, is there any term I can use to describe what I'm doing? (It's harder to ask a question for a concept I don't know the name for)

  SomeClass.const_set 'SOME_CONST', 'SOME_VAL'
end
 Now if I run script/server and make a request, everything is dandy. However, on the second request to my Rails app, all goes to hell with an unitialized constant error. In production mode, I can make the second request successfully, meaning the constant is still there. I've fixed the problem by changing the above to: config.after_initialize do
  require 'some_class' # in RAILS_ROOT/lib/some_class.rb
  SomeClass.const_set 'SOME_CONST', 'SOME_VAL'

 But now that means whenever I make a change to some_class.rb, I have to restart the server. Is there any way to set constants in an environment file and have them work correctly in development mode? Why does the constant exist on the first request, but not the following request? UPDATE: Since environment.rb is only read when the Rails app is booted and I want both my lib files and models to be reloaded on each request, I was forced to move the constants into the some_class.rb file as follows: if Rails.env.development?
  const_set 'SOME_CONST', 'SOME_DEVELOPMENT_VAL'
end
 And in environments/production.rb, I have the old const_set code. UPDATE: An even better method using config.to_prepare is detailed below.

How do I get rid of them all? This is very frustrating since it makes it almost impossible to test new data and to debug any first time installs. Thanks...

@CONTENT:I have written a Class with premain method and inside that method I have added a ClassFileTransformer to Instrumentation (Instrumentation.addTransformer()). I have invoked a application using java -javaagent:<path_to_agnet.jar> <application>
 However ClassFileTransformer.transform() method is not being invoked. I have observed that premain is being invoked. I have also observed that if I call Instrumentation.retransformClasses(), then ClassFileTransformer.transform() is being invoked. On first definition (Classloader.defineClass()), transform() method is not being invoked. Any clue what could be wrong? Note: I can post the source code if that is of any help. Regards, Rejeev.

@CONTENT:We are programming a logging library that keeps itself in a .hpp file. We would like to include <tr1/unordered_map> (if the compiler supports TR1,) or the standard <map> otherwise. Is there a standard way of checking at compile time if tr1 is available or not? I was thinking that the same way that the "__cplusplus" define symbol is present, there could have been defined a "__cxx__tr1" or something like that. I haven't seen that in the drafts for TR1, so I assume it is not present, but I wanted to ask first just in case. As a note, if those defines don't exist, it wouldn't be a bad idea to include them in proposals themselves.

@TITLE:How to convert a DataTable/DataSet into a ObjectDataSource
@CONTENT:I have a GridView that's tied to an ObjectDataSource. I have a method that returns a DataTable. How do I feed the DataTable to the ObjectDataSource so that the GridView is updated in code? Example: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{
    MyClass obj = new MyClass(textbox.Text);
    DataTable dt = obj.GetData();

    ObjectDataSource1.DataSource = dt; 
}
 Yes, I know that the ODS does not have DataSource property. That's why I'm stuck. If you're thinking, why not just assign the GridView the DataTable directly; the answer is: We like the auto-sorting capabilities offered by the ODS + GridView combo. All searches on Google have returned are how to get a DT from an ODS. I can't find a single reference on how to get a DT into the ODS. It would seem that this is quite a common need since people coming from ASP.NET 1.1 will have a lot of code that generates DT and if they want to update the UI, they will want to get the DT into the ODS.

@CONTENT:I work on a large code base with a large install base of users. The code was originally written in vb6 with a few c++ COM modules for low level work. It is completely infeasible to rewrite all of the code that is already written in vb6 and is being used by our customers every day, but we are also continuing to make improvements and customizations to the software (large and small). My solution so far is to write most of the new code in c# (winforms and even wpf now) and then use COM interop to call the modules from vb6. Does anyone out there have experience with long term software suites like this (10+ years) that can't be stopped for a complete rewrite, but need continual new development at the same time. Also, in mixed systems like this, what is the best way to interface the modules? I am using COM right now, but have considered IPC with separate processes as well.

@CONTENT:I have a need to be able to have a super class execute callbacks defined by a class that inherits from it.

@TITLE:Image within a WPF application displays smaller than when viewed in external viewer
@CONTENT:When I display a JPEG in my WPF application (using the following code), it is shown significantly smaller than if I open the JPEG in the Windows Picture Viewer at actual size. I've drilled into the properties of my ImageSource at runtime and my image has: a DPI of 219 a Height of 238.02739726027397 a Width of 312.54794520547944 a PixelHeight of 543 and a PixelWidth of 713 When I use a screen ruler to measure the WPF display of the image, I get approx. 313x240 pixels (which if I could positiont the ruler perfectly would probably be equal to the Width and Height that the ImageSource is reporting.). My gut tells me this has something to do with WPF's use of device independent units (instead of pixels) but I can't make sense of it, and I still need to know how to display the image at the 'actual' size of 543x713 in my application. <Window xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"

@TITLE:How can the friction drag be calculated for a moving and spinning disk on a 2D surface?
@CONTENT:Let's consider a disk with mass m and radius R on a surface where friction u also involved. When we give this disk a starting velocity v in a direction, the disk will go towards that direction and slow down and stop. In case the disk has a rotation (or spin with the rotational line perpendicular on the surface) w beside the speed then the disk won't move on a line, instead bend. Both the linear and angular velocity would be 0 at the end. How can this banding/curving/dragging be calculated? Is it possible to give analytical solution for the X(v,w,t) function, where X would give the position of the disk according to it's initial v w at a given t? Any simulation hint would be also fine. I imagine, depending on w and m and u there would be an additional velocity which is perpendicular to the linear velocity and so the disk's path would bend from the linear path.

    addItem(items);
    Console.WriteLine("The stock Number is " + items[0]);
    Console.WriteLine("The Item name is " + items[2]);
    Console.WriteLine("The price " + items[1]);

 So my question boils down to: How can I allow the user to enter more than one batch of input? For example, the first time the user will enter the information about item ( socket number, price and name), but I need to allow the user enter more information about another item? How can I display the socket num, price and name for each item in the array based on the assumption that I have more than one item in the array?
@CODE:public string stockNum;
public string itemName;
public string price;

string[] items = new string[3];

public string [] addItem(string[] items)
{
    System.Console.WriteLine("Please Sir Enter the stock number");
    stockNum = Console.ReadLine();
    items.SetValue(stockNum, 0);
    System.Console.WriteLine("Please Sir Enter the price");
    price = Console.ReadLine();
    items.SetValue(price, 1);
    System.Console.WriteLine("Please Sir Enter the item name");
    itemName = Console.ReadLine();
    items.SetValue(itemName, 2);
    Array.Sort(items);
    return items;
}


public void ShowItem()
{
    addItem(items);
    Console.WriteLine("The stock Number is " + items[0]);
    Console.WriteLine("The Item name is " + items[2]);
    Console.WriteLine("The price " + items[1]);
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    DepartmentStore depart = new DepartmentStore();
    string[] ar = new string[3];
    // depart.addItem(ar);
    depart.ShowItem();

@CONTENT:I'd be interested to find out about any automated processes that people have for ensuring that the project classpaths for the ant and eclipse configurations are in synch. In my case, I want the classpath defined in the ant build file to be the master configuration, since its used for our production builds. As part of the build i'd like to add an ant target that will verify that the eclipse classpath is up to date, or at least indicate differences between the two classpaths. I'm aware of ant4eclipse but its focus is in the opposite direction, ensuring that the eclipse classpath is master and that the ant build reuses the eclipse path. I like the idea behind AntAndEclipse but am wondering are their ant other tools in this space that i'm not aware of.

 Another thing that puzzles me... In the docs for the time class, the first thing it says is "Implements the extensions to the Time class that are described in the documentation for the time.rb library." Do they mean "the time.rb library implements extensions to this class?" I thought maybe that's where Time#advance came from but all I found was this.

@CONTENT:Definition of Callback: A Function that is set as a property within a Component. And is usually called when some event occurs on the Component. For Example: If you wish to display a dialog which reads "I was clicked" when the user clicks on the Component componentB, you would write a method stored as a variable which does this: var mouseDownCallbackFunction = function() {
    alert("I was clicked!");
};
 Next, you would set this function inside the component like so... // Set the Component to display the dialog when the 
// user presses the mouse down on it.
componentB.setMouseDownCallback(mouseDownCallbackFunction);
 And this would cause mouseDownCallbackFunction to display "I was clicked" in an alert box when the component was clicked.
@CODE:var mouseDownCallbackFunction = function() {
    alert("I was clicked!");
}; // Set the Component to display the dialog when the 
// user presses the mouse down on it.

If I show one Product record on the page and would like to show top n related products, what would be the best option? We should take into account that records might share several keywords and this fact should determine the ordering of the top related product.

@TITLE:Authorization check using Global.asax
@CONTENT:In my ASP.NET web application, I want to check every time the user is trying to get a page from my application if the user exist in the DB (of course after the first time we save the user details in the session). I tried to use the Application_AuthenticateRequest event in the global.asax to check for each request but the session does not exist in this event. I need an advice for where i can put my authorization logic that i would still have the session data available (to reduce db access).

@TITLE:C# Generic Copy Constructor
@CONTENT:I have an interface, and two classes that implements the interface. The classes have generic types. I would like to clone from an instance of one class to the other. interface IFoo
{
    // stuff
}

class Foo<T> : IFoo
{
    // foo stuff
    // ifoo implementation
}

class Bar<T> : IFoo
{
    // bar stuff
    // ifoo implementation
}
 I have a Foo and would like a Bar. Bar has a copy constructor taking a parameter of IFoo. I created an extension method to implement the clone: public static Bar<T> Clone<T>(this IFoo foo) 
{
    return new Bar<T>(foo);
}
 Calling the method requires the type: someFoo.Clone<T> ...
 Is there a way to omit declaring the type when calling the method by modifying the extension method, or any other way, to allow the the instance to just be passed in without caring about its underlying type? Update Here is how this is being used to better illustrate the situation. In a method I iterate a collection and return an enumeration of IFoo. In the method I look at an attribute of the source collection and determine the type of the Foo. IFoo foo = null;

string type = element.Attribute("Type").Value;
switch (type)
{
    case "int":
        foo = new Foo<int>();
        break;

    case "string":
        foo = new Foo<string>();
        break;

    // etc
}
// other stuff

yield return foo;
 The calling method has a List. Later I select individual items from this list for use, at which point I would like a Bar instead of a Foo. When selecting from the list the instances are of type IFoo, as in they only see the extension methods for "this IFoo foo". I do not want to cast the IFoo to a Foo, that would require re-declaring the type of T. I would just like to have Foo tell Bar what it is. Is this possible?
@CODE:interface IFoo
{
    // stuff
}

class Foo<T> : IFoo
{
    // foo stuff
    // ifoo implementation
}

class Bar<T> : IFoo
{
    // bar stuff
    // ifoo implementation
} public static Bar<T> Clone<T>(this IFoo foo) 
{
    return new Bar<T>(foo);
} someFoo.Clone<T> ... IFoo foo = null;

string type = element.Attribute("Type").Value;
switch (type)
{
    case "int":
        foo = new Foo<int>();
        break;

    case "string":
        foo = new Foo<string>();
        break;

    // etc
}
// other stuff

yield return foo;

@TITLE:Best practices for 'InProc' vs 'StateServer' for ASP .NET session state
@CONTENT:We have a single ASP .NET application running on a single web server (no farm). For now, we're using the default 'InProc' session storage. Is it worth considering using the ASP .NET state service instead? If we went that route we'd likely just run the service itself on the same machine as the application, so making calls out over the network to get and set session info wouldn't be an issue. The reason we are considering this at all is to help avoid session data being lost when the app pool recycles. Also, using SQL Server is off the table for now, so we're just talking about in-process vs state server. What are the pros and cons to each mode in this scenario?

@TITLE:Generating lists/reports with in-line summaries in Django
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a view that will generate a report which displays all Items within my Inventory system, and provide summaries at a certain point. This report is purely just an HTML template by the way. In my case, each Item is part of an Order. An Order can have several items, and I want to be able to display SUM based summaries after the end of each order. So the report kind of looks like this: Order #25        <Qty> <Qty Sold> <Cost> <Cost Value>
Some Item          2       1       29.99    29.99

Order #26        <Qty> <Qty Sold> <Cost> <Cost Value>
... Etc, you get the point
 Now, I'm perfectly capable of displaying all the values and already have a report showing all the Items, but I have no idea how I can place Subtotals within the report like that without doing alot of queries. The Quantity, Qty Sold, and Cost fields are just part of the Item model, and Cost Value is just a simple model function. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance :-)

@TITLE:Is using 2 different hash functions a good way to check for file integrity?
@CONTENT:I have a website where users can upload their files; these are stored on the server and their metadata recorded in a database. I'm implementing some simple integrity checks, i.e. "is the content of this file now byte-for-byte identical as when it was uploaded?" An example: for content of userfile.jpg, MD5 hash is 39f9031a154dc7ba105eb4f76f1a0fd4 and SHA-1 hash is 878d8d667721e356bf6646bd2ec21fff50cdd4a9. If this file's content changes, but has the same MD5 hash before and after, is it probable that the SHA-1 hash will also stay the same? (With hashing, sometimes you can get a hash collision - could this happen with two different hashing algorithms at once?) Or is computing two different hashes for a file pointless (and I should try some other mechanism for verifying integrity)? Edit: I'm not really worried about accidental corruption, but I'm supposed to prevent users changing the file unnoticed (birthday attack and friends). I'll probably go with one hash, SHA-512 - the checks don't happen that often to be a performance bottleneck and anyway, "As Bruce Schneier says, there's enough fast, insecure systems out there already. ¡V@MichaelGG in the comments".

@CONTENT:This question is a spin-off from this question. My inquiry is two-fold, but because both are related I think it is a good idea to put them together. How to programmatically create queries. I know I could start creating strings and get that string parsed with the query parser. But as I gather bits and pieces of information from other resources, there is a programattical way to do this. What are the syntax rules for the Lucene queries? --EDIT-- I'll give a requirement example for a query I would like to make: Say I have 5 fields: First Name Last Name Age Address Everything All fields are optional, the last field should search over all the other fields. I go over every field and see if it's IsNullOrEmpty(). If it's not, I would like to append a part of my query so it adds the relevant search part. First name and last name should be exact matches and have more weight then the other fields. Age is a string and should exact match. Address can varry in order. Everything can also varry in order. How should I go about this?

@CONTENT:I have two threads. The producer is producing pieces of data (String objects), where the consumer processes these strings. The catch is that my application only needs the most recent data object to be processed.

Of course there's no problem implementing a class that realizes this behavior, but I want to use a standard mechanism from java.util.concurrent (if such a mechanism exists). Note that SynchronousQueue is not a good solution: the consumer will block when enqueueing "s1" and will not get the chance to produce "s2".

@TITLE:C# Issue: What is the simplest way for me to load a .MDB file, make changes to it, and save the changes back to the original file?
@CONTENT:My project that I am working on is almost finished. I am loading a .MDB file, displaying the contents on a DataGrid and attempting to get those changes on the DataGrid and save them back into the .MDB file. I am also going to create a function that allows me to take the tables from one .MDB file and save it to another .MDB file. Of course, I cannot do any of this if I cannot figure out how to save the changes back to the .MDB file. I have researched Google extensively and there are no answers to my question. I consider myself a beginner at this specific topic so please don't make the answers too complicated -- I need the simplest way to edit a .MDB file! Please provide programming examples. Assume that I've already made a connection to a DataGrid. How do I get the changes made by the Datagrid? Im sure this one is simple enough to answer. I then need to know how to take this Datatable, insert it into Dataset it came from then take that Dataset and rewrite the .MDB file. (If there is a way of only inserting the tables that were changed I would prefer that.) Thank you in advance, let me know if you need more information. This is the last thing I am probably going to have to ask about this topic...thank god. EDIT: The .mdb I am working with is a Microsoft Access Database. ( I didnt even know there were multiple .mdb files) I know I cannot write directly to the .MDB file via a streamwriter or anything but is there a way I can possibly generated a .MDB File with the DataSet information already in it? OR is there just a way that I can add tables to a .MDB file that i've already loaded into the DataGrid. There HAS to be a way! Again, I need a way to do this PROGRAMMATICALLY in C#. EDIT: Okay, my project is fairly large but I use a seperate class file to handle all Database connections. I know my design and source is really sloppy, but it gets the job done. I am only as good as the examples I find on the internet. Remember, I am simply connecting to a DataGrid in another form. Let me know if you want my code from the Datagrid form (I dont know why you would need it though). DatabaseHandling.cs handles 2 .MDB files. So you will see two datasets in there. I will use this eventually to take tables from one Dataset and put them into another Dataset. I just need to figure out how to save these values BACK into a .MDB file. Is there anyway to do this? There has to be a way... EDIT: From what i've researched and read...I think the answer is right under my nose. Using the "Update()" command. Now while this is re-assuring that there is infact a simple way of doing this, I am still left with the problem that I have no-friggin-clue how to use this update command. Perhaps I can set it up like this: Oledb.OledbConnection cn = new Oledb.OledbConnection(); 
cn.ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\Staff.mdb"; 
Oledb.OledbCommand cmd = new Oledb.OledbCommand(cn); 
cmd.CommandText = "INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName) VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName)";
 I think that may do it, but I dont want to manually insert anything. I want to do both of these instead: Take information that is changed on the Datagrid and update the Access Database File (.mdb) that I got it from Create a function that allows me to take tables from another Access Database File (.mdb) and replace them in a secondary Access Database file (.mdb). Both files will use the exact same structure but will have different information in them. I hope someone comes up with a answer for this...my project is done all that awaits is one simple answer. Thank you again in advance. EDIT: Okay...good news. I have figured out how to query the .mdb file itself (I think). Here is the code, which doesn't work because I get a runtime error due to the sql command i'm attempting to use. Which will bring me to my next question. New function code added to DatabaseHandling.cs: static public void performSynchronization(string table, string tableTwoLocation)
{
    OleDbCommand cmdCopyTables = new OleDbCommand("INSERT INTO" + table + "SELECT * FROM [MS Access;" + tableTwoLocation + ";].[" + table + "]"); // This query generates runtime error
    cmdCopyTables.Connection = dataconnectionA;
    dataconnectionA.Open();
    cmdCopyTables.ExecuteNonQuery();
    dataconnectionA.Close();
}
 As you can see, I've actually managed to execute a query on the connection itself, which I believe to be the actual Access .MDB file. As I said though, the SQL query I've executed on the file doesn't work and generated a run-time error when used. The command I am attempting to execute is supposed to take a table from a .MDB file and overwrite a table of the same type of a different .MDB file. The SQL command I attempted above tried to directly take a table from a .mdb file, and directly put it in another -- this isn't what I want to do. I want to take all the information from the .MDB file -- put the tables into a Datatable and then add all the Datatables to a Dataset (which i've done.) I want to do this for two .MDB files. Once I have two Datasets I want to take specific tables out of each Dataset and add them to each file like this: DataSetA >>>>----- [Add Tables (Overwrite Them)] ----->>>> DataSetB DataSetB >>>>----- [Add Tables (Overwrite Them)] ----->>>> DataSetA I want to take those each those Datasets and then put them BACK into each Access .MDB file they came from. Essentially keeping both databases synchronized. So my questions, revised, is: How do I create a SQL query that will add a table to the .MDB file by overwriting the existing one of the same name. The query should be able to be created dynamically during runtime with an array that replaces a variable with the table name I want to add. How do I get the changes that were made by the Datagrid to the DataTable and put them back into a DataTable (or DataSet) so I can send them to the .MDB file? I've tried to elaborate as much as possible...because I believe I am not explaing my issue very well. Now this question has grown wayyy too long. I just wish I could explain this better. :[ EDIT: Thanks to a user below I think I've almost found a fix -- the keyword almost. Here is my updated DatabaseHandling.cs code below. I get a runtime error "Datatype Mismatch." I dont know how that could be possible considering I am trying to copy these tables into another database with the exact same setup. using System;

 Why am I getting this error? Both tables are exactly the same. What am I doing wrong? Worst case, how do I delete the table in the other Access .MDB file before inserting the exact same structure table with different values in it? Man I wish I could just figure this out... EDIT: Okay, I've come some distance. My question has morphed into a new one, and thus deserves being asked seperately. I have had my question answered as now I know how to execute queries directly to the connection that I have opened. Thank you all!

@CONTENT:Let's say my class has a private integer variable called count. I've already hit a breakpoint in my code. Now before I press continue, I want to make it so the debugger will stop anytime count gets a new value assigned to it. Besides promoting count to a field and setting a breakpoint on the set method of the field, is there any other way to do this?

However, I never get this order. Please, look at the outputs, which I have pasted below. public class Test1 {

Hi!
Bye!
 I have two questions: 1.) The more important question: Why I always have Hi! and Bye! printed always one after the other, even though mye.printStackTrace() in the code is between them? 2.) Why sometimes I have the output of the statement e.printStackTrace() before Hi!, and sometimes after Bye! ?

@TITLE:Replicating Sourcesafe's link ablity in SVN or other version control systems?
@CONTENT:Currently my team uses Visual Sourcesafe, and being very familiar with how horrible the GUI is first hand and having heard the internet mummer about how unreliable it is, I've been trying to push a move to SVN. Today I was talking to manager about the eventual move, which he supports, and he asked if it was possible to create sourcesafe style links in SVN. Links, for people not familiar with sourcesafe, work the same conceptually as file links under Linux. We use them to link shared code/libraries between projects. I explained that there was no way to create links using SVN, and he brought up that that may be a major sticking point in the migration. I told him that in my local SVN (which I keep to ease my development, checking only periodically in sourcesafe), I place shared code/libraries in one location, and refer ANT to that location. However, I got the sense that he wasn't hugely impressed by this solution, as it adds complexity to ANT tasks. Personally I think it's worth having a slightly more complex ANT script over having a bunch of link files in source control, but it really a question of which paradigm you subscribe to. I am curious about how developers at large work around this limitation, and do newer source control systems like Git and Mercurial support links?

@TITLE:CSS precedence rules
@CONTENT:My understanding is that there are 3 types of stylesheet: Defined by the page author Defined by the user (i.e. a set of default styles defined by the user and installed into their browser) Default stylesheet defined by the browser According to this book if an element is not matched by a selector in any of these stylesheets, only then will the property value be inherited from parent elements. However, the book also says that a browser's default stylesheet should define a style for all types of elements. If a browser's stylesheet does define a style for all types of element, and this style has a higher precendence than inheritance, then inherited property values should never be observed. Clearly this is not the case, so what exactly are the correct precedence rules for properties defined in a browser's default stylesheet and those defined for parent elements?

@TITLE:In Visual Studio can i plot my variable in breakpoint?
@CONTENT:In Visual Studio for my native C++ program I want to get a plot of some variables during debug. Mostly I use textual representation of the objects by editing autoexp.dat. But for some of the variables it is better to have a plot rather than having values in textual form. So far I have used a function plot(const void* address,const char* type) , and called it from Immediate Window giving the variable address & the type, and internally casting it to proper type. But this method has two disadvantage. First is that, function overloading almost never works when calling a function from debugger (so I had to pass type as a second parameter), and the function call occasionally crashes, though it works perfectly when called from within code. Second is, instead of writing a C++ function for plotting, I am interested to have a scripting language (like autoexp.dat or a VBScript) to give the internal data of the C++ object without writing any wrapper, so that I can use the script to store the data in a file or plot it. In general I am interested to have something like Matlab or Ch IDE, where I can plot certain variable externally when the program is at a debug break.

@TITLE:Why Encrypt Query Strings in ASP.NET?
@CONTENT:I work on a web-application that is written in C#/ASP.NET. The original framers of this application chose to use encrypted query strings and Viewstate to control the 'security' and 'state' of the application. Having come from a GET/POST world before this, I don't have a good basis for understanding why people would go through the trouble of encrypting query strings, when using POST for sensitive data (along with SSL) would achieve a similar level of security. My question is: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Encrypted Query Strings in ASP.NET? Is there a documented 'best practice' for this? Edit: People tend to focus on Viewstate in this question. Don't. Viewstate was mentioned only to give you a better idea to ascertain how 'state' was managed, since that is tangentially related to URLs. I never said Viewstate was encrypted. There really are two issues: 1) The Use of Viewstate, and 2) the Use of encrypted query strings. This question is focused on the latter. I hope that helps to clear up the focus of the question.

It could also be multiple solutions, e.g. one per language, as long as they can can access the same database and use the same schema. Multi platform support is also needed. Clarification: The idea is to have one database and access this from software written in several different programming languages. Ideally this would be provided by one ORM having APIs (or bindings) in all of these languages. One other solution is to have a different ORM in each language, that use compatible schemas.

The website is working in production, however the development environment (hosting on a Windows Server 2003 box) produces an HTTP 500 error when you try to navigate to it.

@TITLE:Do you know of a resource that lists all the font-families with their fall-backs that are good on the web?
@CONTENT:Note: I've made a few edits here as I didn't get my question across very well the first time around. Update: After doing some of my own research on this subject, I've come up with a perfect example of why I'm searching out the perfect list of font-family with fall-backs: http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/ body {
font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
}
strong, em, b, i {
font-family: "Lucida Sans", "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
 I'm suspecting that someone else has done a detailed list like this and rather than my doing it all again, I'd love to make use of someone elses hard work. If no one else has done this, then I'll go ahead and start my own? I know how to search for web safe fonts, and how to include fall-backs for the different browser types to get close to my desired font and we've all done this many times before. However, I once saw an example of where someone had saved a list of all the fall-backs in a style sheet and all you needed to do was comment out the ones you weren't using. The list appeared to contain most of the fonts that anyone would ever want to use, and rather than continuously scouring around the web every time to create my own list, I'm wondering if anyone else knows of this or any other list of fonts with fall-backs? Example: body {
font-family:Arial,Helvetica,"Bitstream Vera Sans",sans-serif;
/* 
font-family:"Trebuchet MS","Bitstream Vera Sans",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;
font-family:Consolas,Monaco,Liberation Mono,Lucida Console;
...
*/
}
 In my example above, you'll see font-family:Consolas,Monaco,Liberation Mono,Lucida Console; (snagged from SO's style sheet) and none of the resources listed so far would result in my building that fall-back family. Is Monaco similar to Consolas? Is this a good fall-back list for someone who primarily wants Consolas? If it is, then I want this added to my list of acceptable font-families... Cheers, Steve

@TITLE:Web pages to print media ¡X solutions?
@CONTENT:I've been a big fan of MediaWiki and similar wiki-based text editors. I like the ability to quickly add text, collaborate, and share. However, there's always still the need for nicely formatted print output. Things like headers and footers (that say what I want them to say), page breaks, margins, etc. Most solutions I've seen involve some sort of conversion to a intermediate print-media format (maybe MediaWiki to Microsoft Word or maybe some custom scripting that generates a PDF from the contents of a web page (with a lot of hard-coded references). Is there any more generic solution that exists for this problem? Any framework that seeks to merge HTML and web content in general into a print media output format? Any solutions, discussion regarding the pro's or con's, or whatever is welcome. Thanks! Update: I think CSS will only get me so far though... I've used CSS for similar type output (MediaWiki by default has a print format that hides much of the nav bar stuff). Think of a MediaWiki article though -- imagine me being able to tweak a tag in the content or something similar and now my margin is 1 inch instead of .5 inches. That's more along the lines of what I'm aiming for.

@TITLE:Best to have hundreds of columns or split into multiple tables?
@CONTENT:I'm designing a database of statistics about the operation of mechanical equipment. Each batch of data will contain hundreds of statistics, so I'm trying to decide whether to create a single table with hundreds of columns or to split it up into multiple tables, each containing related statistics. For example, I could have one table containing the statistics related to malfunctions, another table with the statistics related to jams, etc. Using multiple tables would make the system more complex overall, though conceptually it might be easier for me to deal with several smaller tables than one big one. Would there be any performance benefits to splitting things up? It seems like querying a table with a few dozen columns would probably be faster than querying one with hundreds of columns. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? I'm using Oracle for this project, although this is something I'll likely run into with out databases in the future, so answers for any database would be appreciated.

@CONTENT:I've have just been stumped with this problem for an hour and I annoyingly found the problem eventually. THE CIRCUMSTANCES I have a table which users a string as a primary key, this table has various many to one and many to many relationships all off this primary key. When searching for multiple items from the table all relationships were brought back. However whenever I tried to get the object by the primary key (string) it was not bringing back any relationships, they were always set to 0. THE PARTIAL SOLUTION So I looked into my logs to see what the SQL was doing and that was returning the correct results. So I tried various things in all sorts of random ways and eventually worked out it was. The case of the string being passed into the get method was not EXACTLY the same case as it was in the database, so when it tried to match up the relationship items with the main entity it was finding nothing (Or at least NHIbernate wasn't because as I stated above the SQL was actually returning the correct results) THE REAL SOLUTION Has anyone else come across this? If so how do you tell NHibernate to ignore case when matching SQL results to the entity? It is silly because it worked perfectly well before now all of a sudden it has started to pay attention to the case of the string.

@CONTENT:I'm just learning Qt with C++. I have successfully implemented signals and slots to trap standard events like ButtonPushed(), etc. However, I want to have a function called when I mouse over and mouse out of a QLabel. It looks like QHoverEvent will do what I need, but I can't seem to find any tutorials or examples on how to implement this? Is it done the same way as signals and slots? I tried: connect(ui.lbl_test, SIGNAL(QHoverEvent), this, SLOT(TestFunc(QEvent::Type type, const QPoint & pos, const QPoint & oldPos)));
 .. but the function didn't get called when I hovered over the label. Here is the function, listed in the header file as a public slot: void MyDialog::TestFunc(QEvent::Type type, const QPoint & pos, const QPoint & oldPos) {
     QMessageBox::information(this, tr("Hey"), tr("Listen!"));
}
 Can anyone help me figure this out or point me to a good example? EDIT: After reading a post below, I found no setFlag() member to call for my label widget, but I did try:     ui.lbl_test->setMouseTracking(true);
    connect(ui.lbl_test, SIGNAL(ui.lbl_test->mouseMoveEvent()), this, SLOT(TestFunc(QMouseEvent *event)));
 And updated TestFunc() accordingly. But still nothing happens when I mouse over. After looking I am not sure QLabel even inherits the mouseMoveEvent() even from QWidget. If this is true, is there a widget that does, or a list of objects that inherit it somewhere? All I can tell from the documentation on their site is how many inherited functions an object has..

@TITLE:Implementing IAsyncResult explicitly
@CONTENT:I am generally wary of implementing interfaces partially. However, IAsyncResult is a bit of a special case, given that it supports several quite different usage patterns. How often do you use/see used the AsyncState/AsyncCallback pattern, as opposed to just calling EndInvoke, using AsyncWaitHandle, or polling IsCompleted (yuck)? Related question: Detecting that a ThreadPool WorkItem has completed/waiting for completion. Consider this class (very approximate, locking needed): public class Concurrent<T> {
    private ManualResetEvent _resetEvent;
    private T _result;

    public Concurrent(Func<T> f) {
        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(_ => {
                                         _result = f();
                                         IsCompleted = true;
                                         if (_resetEvent != null)
                                             _resetEvent.Set();
                                     });
    }

    public WaitHandle WaitHandle {
        get {
            if (_resetEvent == null)
                _resetEvent = new ManualResetEvent(IsCompleted);
            return _resetEvent;
        }

    public bool IsCompleted {get; private set;}

 And I want to write a query that counts the number of home games and away games for each team and outputs the following: team_id | home_games | away_games
100     | 2          | 1
200     | 2          | 1
300     | 1          | 1
400     | 0          | 2
 Right now, I wrote this monstrosity that works, but it's slow (I know it's pulling the entire 2,800 row from the table twice). SELECT 
  home_team_id as team_id,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM `game` WHERE home_team_id = temp_game.home_team_id) as home_games,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM `game` WHERE home_team_id = temp_game.away_team_id) as away_games
  FROM (SELECT * FROM `game`) as temp_game
  GROUP BY home_team_id
 Can a SQL guru help me knock out a better way? I think my problem is that I don't understand how to get a distinct list of the team IDs to throw at the count queries. I bet there's a better way with a better placed, nested SELECT. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:NHibernate with string primary key and relationships
@CONTENT:I've have just been stumped with this problem for an hour and I annoyingly found the problem eventually. THE CIRCUMSTANCES I have a table which users a string as a primary key, this table has various many to one and many to many relationships all off this primary key. When searching for multiple items from the table all relationships were brought back. However whenever I tried to get the object by the primary key (string) it was not bringing back any relationships, they were always set to 0. THE PARTIAL SOLUTION So I looked into my logs to see what the SQL was doing and that was returning the correct results. So I tried various things in all sorts of random ways and eventually worked out it was. The case of the string being passed into the get method was not EXACTLY the same case as it was in the database, so when it tried to match up the relationship items with the main entity it was finding nothing (Or at least NHIbernate wasn't because as I stated above the SQL was actually returning the correct results) THE REAL SOLUTION Has anyone else come across this? If so how do you tell NHibernate to ignore case when matching SQL results to the entity? It is silly because it worked perfectly well before now all of a sudden it has started to pay attention to the case of the string.

@TITLE:How do I implement QHoverEvent in Qt?
@CONTENT:I'm just learning Qt with C++. I have successfully implemented signals and slots to trap standard events like ButtonPushed(), etc. However, I want to have a function called when I mouse over and mouse out of a QLabel. It looks like QHoverEvent will do what I need, but I can't seem to find any tutorials or examples on how to implement this? Is it done the same way as signals and slots? I tried: connect(ui.lbl_test, SIGNAL(QHoverEvent), this, SLOT(TestFunc(QEvent::Type type, const QPoint & pos, const QPoint & oldPos)));
 .. but the function didn't get called when I hovered over the label. Here is the function, listed in the header file as a public slot: void MyDialog::TestFunc(QEvent::Type type, const QPoint & pos, const QPoint & oldPos) {
     QMessageBox::information(this, tr("Hey"), tr("Listen!"));
}
 Can anyone help me figure this out or point me to a good example? EDIT: After reading a post below, I found no setFlag() member to call for my label widget, but I did try:     ui.lbl_test->setMouseTracking(true);
    connect(ui.lbl_test, SIGNAL(ui.lbl_test->mouseMoveEvent()), this, SLOT(TestFunc(QMouseEvent *event)));
 And updated TestFunc() accordingly. But still nothing happens when I mouse over. After looking I am not sure QLabel even inherits the mouseMoveEvent() even from QWidget. If this is true, is there a widget that does, or a list of objects that inherit it somewhere? All I can tell from the documentation on their site is how many inherited functions an object has..
@CODE:connect(ui.lbl_test, SIGNAL(QHoverEvent), this, SLOT(TestFunc(QEvent::Type type, const QPoint & pos, const QPoint & oldPos))); void MyDialog::TestFunc(QEvent::Type type, const QPoint & pos, const QPoint & oldPos) {

How often do you use/see used the AsyncState/AsyncCallback pattern, as opposed to just calling EndInvoke, using AsyncWaitHandle, or polling IsCompleted (yuck)?

@CONTENT:If an application? crashes, I hit "Debug" and Visual Studio is my currently registered Just-In-Time (JIT) debugger: Visual Studio appears, but there's no way to debug anything: I do not see any disassembly I do not see any registers (assuming it runs on a CPU with registers) The call stack is empty (assuming the CPU has a stack pointer) I do not see any symbols (assuming it had any) I do not see reconstructed source code from reflection (assuming it was managed) Other JIT debugger products are able to show disassembly, but they are either command-line based (Debugging Tools for Windows), or do not support symbols (OllyDbg, Delphi). Additionally, my question is about debugging using Visual Studio, since I already have it installed, and it is already my registered JIT. How do you debug a program using Visual Studio? Alternatively: has anyone written a graphical debugger that supports the Microsoft symbol server? ? Not, necessarily, written in Visual Studio. Edit: Changes title to process rather than application, since the latter somehow implies "my application." Edit: Assume the original application was written in assembly language by Steve Gibson. That is, there is no source code or debug information. Visual Studio should still be able to show me an assembly dump.

@TITLE:Element-in-List testing
@CONTENT:For a stylesheet I'm writing (actually for a set of them, each generating a different output format), I have the need to evaluate whether a certain value is present in a list of values. In this case, the value being tested is taken from an element's attribute. The list it is to be tested against comes from the invocation of the stylesheet, and is taken as a top-level <xsl:param> (to be provided on the command-line when I call xsltproc or a Saxon equivalent invocation). For example, the input value may be: v0_01,v0_10,v0_99
 while the attribute values will each look very much like one such value. (Whether a comma is used to separate values, or a space, is not important-- I chose a comma for now because I plan on passing the value via command-line switch to xsltproc, and using a space would require quoting the argument, and I'm lazy-enough to not want to type the extra two characters.) What I am looking for is something akin to Perl's grep, wherein I can see if the value I currently have is contained in the list. It can be done with sub-string tests, but this would have to be clever so as not to get a false-positive (v0_01 should not match a string that contains v0_011). It seems that the only non-scalar data-type that XSL/XSLT supports is a node-set. I suppose it's possible to convert the list into a set of text nodes, but that seems like over-kill, even compared to making a sub-string test with extra boundaries-checking to prevent false matches.

@CONTENT:I have a table with almost 800,000 records and I am currently using dynamic sql to generate the query on the back end. The front end is a search page which takes about 20 parameters and depending on if a parameter was chosen, it adds an " AND ..." to the base query. I'm curious as to if dynamic sql is the right way to go ( doesn't seem like it because it runs slow). I am contemplating on just creating a denormalized table with all my data. Is this a good idea or should I just build the query all together instead of building it piece by piece using the dynamic sql. Last thing, is there a way to speed up dynamic sql?

@TITLE:Testing with random inputs best practices
@CONTENT:NOTE: I mention the next couple of paragraphs as background. If you just want a TL;DR, feel free to skip down to the numbered questions as they are only indirectly related to this info. I'm currently writing a python script that does some stuff with POSIX dates (among other things). Unit testing these seems a little bit difficult though, since there's such a wide range of dates and times that can be encountered. Of course, it's impractical for me to try to test every single date/time combination possible, so I think I'm going to try a unit test that randomizes the inputs and then reports what the inputs were if the test failed. Statisically speaking, I figure that I can achieve a bit more completeness of testing than I could if I tried to think of all potential problem areas (due to missing things) or testing all cases (due to sheer infeasability), assuming that I run it enough times. So here are a few questions (mainly indirectly related to the above ): What types of code are good candidates for randomized testing? What types of code aren't? How do I go about determining the number of times to run the code with randomized inputs? I ask this because I want to have a large enough sample to determine any bugs, but don't want to wait a week to get my results. Are these kinds of tests well suited for unit tests, or is there another kind of test that it works well with? Are there any other best practices for doing this kind of thing?

Why will a delete on trunk not delete the same file on a branch when merging? I'm using subversion 1.5 client and server. I'm assuming that changes to the file in the branch will be skipped when reintegrating the branch? What's the best way to redeem the file on trunk, as a colleague deleted the file from trunk only because it was not "ready". Situation: cd project; svn copy trunk branches/f1; svn ci -m "branching out" branches f1;

 So, the file still exists in my working copy even though I'm merging in trunk where the file has been actively deleted. Highly unexpected. In my case I haven't even made any changes to the file, which is the only reason i can think of why svn would save the file.

Please realize that for the example I've included I didn't want to clutter it up with the code reading from a file or code to get numbers from a user. In the actual application I won't know how big of an array I need at compile time so please don't tell me to just make an array with two elements and set them equal to 5 and 6 respectively. Thanks for your help.

    x = new double[1];

    cout << x[0] << "," << x[1] << endl;
    return 0;

@TITLE:Why exactly would I want to use a WSDL to describe a Web service?
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble understanding why a WSDL would be so beneficial, when the truth is that the service definition is not that human-readable, and most developers will use automated tools to consume it to generate objects in the application. Why isn't it easier for a service provider to define a simple XML schema, and just tell me in the documentation what I can get and how I can get it? I understand the whole "universal definition" aspect, but it all just seems so overcomplicated to me. Most APIs for social sites use a basic RESTful architecture, and all they do is give you a schema representation of the data you will get back. Seriously, I must be missing something here.

@CONTENT:Some of the answers to a question I had about redirect_to made me think about some other questions. Basically I'm writing a blog application using Rails 2.1. I've been trying to do most of it myself (as I know a bit of rails), but with reference to tutorials and references on the internet when I need it. I managed to get a simple blog working, then I tried to add comments. By myself I managed to get it to the stage where I could add comments from script/console but I had trouble getting the form to work. One of the tutorials I followed suggested creating a 'comment' action in the posts controller, which adds the comment. My question is: is that the 'standard' way to do it? One of the answers to my other question seemed to suggest that there should be a CommentsController involved...should there be? I've managed to fix the problem I asked in my other question, but I'm a little concerned if I'm just making dirty quick hacks rather than programming rails well.

@TITLE:ImageMagick Reflection
@CONTENT:Brief: convert ( -size 585x128 gradient: )  NewImage.png
 How do I change the above ImageMagick command so it takes the width and height from an existing image? I need it to remain a one line command. Details: I'm trying to programatically create an image reflection using ImageMagick. The effect I am looking for is similar to what you would see when looking at an object on the edge of a pool of water. There is a pretty good thread on what I am trying to do here but the solution isn't exactly what I am looking for. Since I will be calling ImageMagick from a C#.Net application I want to use one call without any temp files and return the image through stdout. So far I have this... convert OriginalImage.png  ( OriginalImage.png -flip -blur 3x5 \
    -crop 100%%x30%%+0+0 -negate -evaluate multiply 0.3 \
    -negate  ( -size 585x128 gradient: ) +matte -compose copy_opacity -composite )
    -append NewImage.png
 This works ok but doesn't give me the exact fade I am looking for. Instead of a nice solid fade from top to bottom it is giving me a fade from top left to bottom right. I added the (-negate -evaluate multiply 0.3 -negate) section in to lighten it up a bit more since I wasn't getting the fade I wanted. I also don't want to have to hard code in the size of the image when creating the gradient ( -size 585x128 gradient: ) I'm also going to want to keep the original image's transparency if possible. To go to stdout I plan on replacing "NewImage.png" with "-"

@TITLE:How to log in an Oracle database?
@CONTENT:I am interested in what methods of logging is frequent in an Oracle database. Our method is the following: We create a log table for the table to be logged. The log table contains all the columns of the original table plus some special fields including timestamp, modification type (insert, update, delete), modifier's id. A trigger on the original table creates one log row for each insertion and deletion, and two rows for a modification. Log rows contain the data before and after the alteration of the original one. Although state of the records can be mined back in time using this method, it has some drawbacks: Introduction of a new column in the original table does not automatically involves log modification. Log modification affects log table and trigger and it is easy to mess up. State of a record at a specific past time cannot be determined in a straightforward way. ... What other possibilities exist? What kind of tools can be used to solve this problem? I only know of log4plsql. What are the pros/cons of this tool?

@TITLE:Hash of a string to be of specific length
@CONTENT:Is there a way to generate a hash of a string so that the hash itself would be of specific length? I've got a function that generates 41-byte hashes (SHA-1), but I need it to be 33-bytes max (because of certain hardware limitations). If I truncate the 41-byte hash to 33, I'd probably (certainly!) lost the uniqueness. Or actually I suppose an MD5 algorithm would fit nicely, if I could find some C code for one with your help. Thanks in advance for any tips/pointers! EDIT: Thank you all for the quick and knowledgeable responses. I've chosen to go with an MD5 hash and it fits fine for my purpose. The uniqueness is an important issue, but I don't expect the number of those hashes to be very large at any given time - these hashes represent software servers on a home LAN, so at max there would be 5, maybe 10 running.

So I will want my IoC container (whichever one I go with) to supply the services, but it'll be up to the calling code to supply the Order object to edit. Should I declare the constructor as taking the Order object as the first parameter and the ProductsService and CustomersService after that, eg: public OrderForm(Order order, ProductsService prodsSvc, CustomersService custsSvc)
 ... or should the dependencies come first and the Order object last, eg: public OrderForm(ProductsService prodsSvc, CustomersService custsSvc, Order order)

We are using .NET 3.5/C# and our tables are designed with the appropriate data types. My argument is that we are already "types oriented" in our thinking why break that approach because it is XML.

@TITLE:ASP.NET Ajax - Asynch request has separate session?
@CONTENT:We are writing a search application that saves the search criteria to session state and executes the search inside of an asp.net updatepanel. Sometimes when we execute multiple searches successively the 2nd or 3rd search will sometimes return results from the first set of search criteria. Example: our first search we do a look up on "John Smith" -> John Smith results are displayed. The second search we do a look up on "Bob Jones" -> John Smith results are displayed. We save all of the search criteria in session state as I said, and read it from session state inside of the ajax request to format the DB query. When we put break points in VS everything behaves as normal, but without them we get the original search criteria and results. My guess is because they are saved in session, that the ajax request somehow gets its own session and saves the criteria to that, and then retrieves the criteria from that session every time, but the non-async stuff is able to see when the criteria is modified and saves the changes to state accordingly, but because they are from two different sessions there is a disparity in what is saved and read. EDIT::: To elaborate more, there was a suggestion of appending the search criteria to the query string which normally is good practice and I agree thats how it should be but following our requirements I don't see it as being viable. They want it so the user fills out the input controls hits search and there is no page reload, the only thing they see is a progress indicator on the page, and they still have the ability to navigate and use other features on the current page. If I were to add criteria to the query string I would have to do another request causing the whole page to load, which depending on the search criteria can take a really long time. This is why we are using an ajax call to perform the search and why we aren't causing another full page request..... I hope this clarifies the situation.

@TITLE:Change datatype when importing Excel file into Access
@CONTENT:Is there any way to change the default datatype when importing an Excel file into Access? (I'm using Access 2003, by the way). I know that I sometimes have the freedom to assign any datatype to each column that is being imported, but that could only be when I'm importing non-Excel files. EDIT: To be clear, I understand that there is a step in the import process where you are allowed to change the datatype of the imported column. In fact, that's what I'm asking about. For some reason - maybe it's always Excel files, maybe there's something else - I am sometimes not allowed to change the datatype: the dropdown box is grayed out and I just have to live with whatever datatype Access assumes is correct. For example, I just tried importing a large-ish Excel file (12000+ rows, ~200 columns) in Access where column #105 (or something similar) was filled with mostly numbers (codes: 1=foo, 2=bar, etc), though there are a handful of alpha codes in there too (A=boo, B=far, etc). Access assumed it was a Number datatype (even after I changed the Format value in the Excel file itself) and so gave me errors on those alpha codes. If I had been allowed to change the datatype on import, it would have saved me some trouble. Am I asking for something that Access just won't do, or am I missing something? Thanks. EDIT: There are two answers below that give useful advice. Saving the Excel file as a CSV and then importing that works well and is straightforward like Chris OC says. The advice for saving an import specification is very helpful too. However, I chose the registry setting answer by DK as the "Accepted Answer". I liked it as an answer because it's a one-time-only step that can be used to solve my major problem (having Access incorrectly assign a datatype). In short, this solution doesn't allow me to change the datatype myself, but it makes Access accurately guess the datatype so that there are fewer issues.

@TITLE:How do I unit-test inheriting objects?
@CONTENT:When you use composition, then you can mock the other objects from which your class-under-test depends, but when you use inheritance, you can't mock the base class. (Or can you?) I generally try to prefer composition over inheritance, but sometimes inheritance really seems like the best tool for the job - well, at least until it comes to unit-testing. So, how do you test inheritance? Or do you just trash it as untestable and use composition instead? Note: I mostly use PHP and PHPUnit, so help on that side is most appreciated. But it would also be interesting to know if there are solutions to this problem in other languages.

@LINK:/questions/94148/appropriate-design-pattern-for-an-event-log-parser
@TITLE:Appropriate design pattern for an event log parser?
@CONTENT:Working on a project that parses a log of events, and then updates a model based on properties of those events. I've been pretty lazy about "getting it done" and more concerned about upfront optimization, lean code, and proper design patterns. Mostly a self-teaching experiment. I am interested in what patterns more experienced designers think are relevant, or what type of pseudocoded object architecture would be the best, easiest to maintain and so on. There can be 500,000 events in a single log, and there are about 60 types of events, all of which share about 7 base properties and then have 0 to 15 additional properties depending on the event type. The type of event is the 2nd property in the log file in each line. So for I've tried a really ugly imperative parser that walks through the log line by line and then processes events line by line. Then I tried a lexical specification that uses a "nextEvent" pattern, which is called in a loop and processed. Then I tried a plain old "parse" method that never returns and just fires events to registered listener callbacks. I've tried both a single callback regardless of event type, and a callback method specific to each event type. I've tried a base "event" class with a union of all possible properties. I've tried to avoid the "new Event" call (since there can be a huge number of events and the event objects are generally short lived) and having the callback methods per type with primitive property arguments. I've tried having a subclass for each of the 60 event types with an abstract Event parent with the 7 common base properties. I recently tried taking that further and using a Command pattern to put event handling code per event type. I am not sure I like this and its really similar to the callbacks per type approach, just code is inside an execute function in the type subclasses versus the callback methods per type. The problem is that alot of the model updating logic is shared, and alot of it is specific to the subclass, and I am just starting to get confused about the whole thing. I am hoping someone can at least point me in a direction to consider!

@TITLE:Does LINQ-to-SQL Support Composable Queries?
@CONTENT:Speaking as a non-C# savvy programmer, I'm curious as to the evaluation semantics of LINQ queries like the following: var people = from p in Person
             where p.age < 18
             select p

var otherPeople = from p in people
                  where p.firstName equals "Daniel"
                  select p
 Assuming that Person is an ADO entity which defines the age and firstName fields, what would this do from a database standpoint? Specifically, would the people query be run to produce an in-memory structure, which would then be queried by the otherPeople query? Or would the construction of otherPeople merely pull the data regarding the query from people and then produce a new database-peered query? So, if I iterated over both of these queries, how many SQL statements would be executed?

@TITLE:Should rails models be concerned with other models for the sake of skinny controllers?
@CONTENT:I read everywhere that business logic belongs in the models and not in controller but where is the limit? I am toying with a personnal accounting application. Account
Entry
Operation
 When creating an operation it is only valid if the corresponding entries are created and linked to accounts so that the operation is balanced for exemple buy a 6-pack : o=Operation.new({:description=>"b33r", :user=>current_user, :date=>"2008/09/15"})
o.entries.build({:account_id=>1, :amount=>15})
o.valid? #=>false
o.entries.build({:account_id=>2, :amount=>-15})
o.valid? #=>true
 Now the form shown to the user in the case of basic operations is simplified to hide away the entries details, the accounts are selected among 5 default by the kind of operation requested by the user (intialise account -> equity to accout, spend assets->expenses, earn revenues->assets, borrow liabilities->assets, pay debt assets->liabilities ...) I want the entries created from default values. I also want to be able to create more complex operations (more than 2 entries). For this second use case I will have a different form where the additional complexity is exposed.This second use case prevents me from including a debit and credit field on the Operation and getting rid of the Entry link. Which is the best form ? Using the above code in a SimpleOperationController as I do for the moment, or defining a new method on the Operation class so I can call Operation.new_simple_operation(params[:operation]) Isn't it breaking the separation of concerns to actually create and manipulate Entry objects from the Operation class ? I am not looking for advice on my twisted accounting principles :) edit -- It seems I didn't express myself too clearly. I am not so concerned about the validation. I am more concerned about where the creation logic code should go : assuming the operation on the controller is called spend, when using spend, the params hash would contain : amount, date, description. Debit and credit accounts would be derived from the action which is called, but then I have to create all the objects. Would it be better to have #error and transaction handling is left out for the sake of clarity
def spend
  amount=params[:operation].delete(:amount)#remove non existent Operation attribute
  op=Operation.new(params[:operation])
  #select accounts in some way
  ...
  #build entries
  op.entries.build(...)
  op.entries.build(...)
  op.save
end
 or to create a method on Operation that would make the above look like def spend
  op=Operation.new_simple_operation(params)
  op.save
end
 this definitely give a much thinner controller and a fatter model, but then the model will create and store instances of other models which is where my problem is.
@CODE:Account
Entry
Operation o=Operation.new({:description=>"b33r", :user=>current_user, :date=>"2008/09/15"})
o.entries.build({:account_id=>1, :amount=>15})
o.valid? #=>false
o.entries.build({:account_id=>2, :amount=>-15})
o.valid? #=>true #error and transaction handling is left out for the sake of clarity
def spend
  amount=params[:operation].delete(:amount)#remove non existent Operation attribute
  op=Operation.new(params[:operation])
  #select accounts in some way

  op.entries.build(...)
  op.entries.build(...)

@CONTENT:I have a large codebase that targetted Flash 7, with a lot of AS2 classes. I'm hoping that I'll be able to use Flex for any new projects, but a lot of new stuff in our roadmap is additions to the old code. The syntax for AS2 and AS3 is generally the same, so I'm starting to wonder how hard it would be to port the current codebase to Flex/AS3. I know all the UI-related stuff would be iffy (currently the UI is generated at runtime with a lot of createEmptyMovieClip() and attachMovie() stuff), but the UI and controller/model stuff is mostly separated. Has anyone tried porting a large codebase of AS2 code to AS3? How difficult is it? What kinds of pitfalls did you run into? Any recommendations for approaches to doing this kind of project?

{
    private static Int32 counter = 0;

}
 Please confirm Instance constructors are thread-safe. The lock statement prevents access to that code block, not to the static 'counter' member. If the intent of the original programmer were to have each instance know its 'count', how would I synchronize access to the 'counter' member to ensure that another thread isn't new'ing a MyClass and changing the count before this one sets its count? FYI - This class is not a singleton. Instances must simply be aware of their number.

{
    private static Int32 counter = 0;

As CCNET build and deploys the app it also runs a set of test using NUnit. I'd now like to test the web service communication as well. My idea is that as part of the build process a web service should be generated (based on the external web services WSDL) and deployed to the build servers local web server. All the web service should do is to receive the message and place it on the file system so I then can check it using ordinary NUnit for example. This would also make development easier as new developers would only have to run the build script and be up and running (not have to spend time to set up a connection to the third party service). Are there any existing utilities out there that easily mock a web service based on a WSDL? Anyone done something similar using MSBuild? Are there other ways of testing this scenario?

@TITLE:Migrating from ASP Classic to .NET and pain mitigation
@CONTENT:We're in the process of redesigning the customer facing section of our site in .NET 3.5. It's been going well so far, we're using the same workflow and stored procedures for the most part, the biggest changes are the UI, the ORM (from dictionaries to LINQ), and obviously the language. Most of the pages to this point have been trivial, but now we're working on the heaviest workflow pages. The main page of our offer acceptance section is 1500 lines, about 90% of that is ASP, with probably another 1000 lines in function calls to includes. I think the 1500 lines is a bit deceiving too since we're working with gems like this function GetDealText(sUSCurASCII, sUSCurName, sTemplateOptionID, sSellerCompany, sOfferAmount, sSellerPremPercent, sTotalOfferToSeller, sSellerPremium, sMode, sSellerCurASCII, sSellerCurName, sTotalOfferToSeller_SellerCurr, sOfferAmount_SellerCurr, sSellerPremium_SellerCurr, sConditions, sListID,  sDescription, sSKU, sInv_tag, sFasc_loc, sSerialNoandModel, sQTY, iLoopCount, iBidCount, sHTMLConditions, sBidStatus, sBidID, byRef bAlreadyAccepted, sFasc_Address1, sFasc_City, sFasc_State_id, sFasc_Country_id, sFasc_Company_name, sListingCustID, sAskPrice_SellerCurr, sMinPrice_SellerCurr, sListingCur, sOrigLocation)
 The standard practice I've been using so far is to spend maybe an hour or so reading over the app both to familiarize myself with it, but also to strip out commented-out/deprecated code. Then to work in a depth-first fashion. I'll start at the top and copy a segment of code in the aspx.cs file and start rewriting, making obvious refactorings as I go especially to take advantage of our ORM. If I get to a function call that we don't have, I'll write out the definition. After I have everything coded I'll do a few passes at refactoring/testing. I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on how to make this process a little easier/more efficient.

@CONTENT:I am trying to set up dynamic per-item menus (Edit Control Block) in SharePoint 2007. My goal is to have certain features that are available based on the current user's group membership. I know that the CustomAction tag that controls the creation of this menu item has a Rights attribute. The problem that I have with this is that the groups I am using have identical rights in the site (ViewListItems, ManageAlerts, etc). The groups that we have set up deal more with function, such as Manager, Employee, etc. We want to be able to assign a custom feature to a group, and have the menu items associated with that feature visible only to members of that group. Everyone has the same basic site permissions, but will have extra options availble based on their login credentials. I have seen several articles on modifying the Core.js file to hide items in the context menu, but they are an all-or-nothing approach. There is an interesting post at http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2008/04/29/sharepoint-custom-actions-in-a-list-view-webpart.aspx that shows how to dynamically modify the Actions menu. It is trivial to modify this example to check the users group and show or hide the menu based on membership.

@TITLE:Template instantiation, two-phase name lookup, different behavior with automatic deduced type
@CONTENT:After seeing this question When is a C++ template instantiation type checked? , and wondering myself for quite some time the same thing I started to play with code to assimilate the knowledge. The answer gives clear and correct explanation. It mentions two-phase name lookup and the fact that the end of translation unit is also considered a point of instantiation for function templates. However I observed different behavior when using automatic return type deduction: This is like the original code. It is correct and works as explained in the linked post: class A;
class B;

template <class T> auto foo() -> T * {
  A *pa = nullptr; // ignore pa being `nullptr`.
  return static_cast<T *>(pa);
}

auto test() { return foo<B>(); }

class A {};
class B : public A {};
 When using automatic return type deduction for the template foo, the definitions of A and B must appear before the instantiation point of foo: Not working: class A;
class B;

template <class T> auto foo()  { // automatic return type deduction
  A *pa = nullptr;
  return static_cast<T *>(pa);
}

auto test() { return foo<B>(); }

class A {};
class B : public A {};
 The error by gcc (4.9 and 5.2.1): error: invalid static_cast from type ¡¥A*¡¦ to type ¡¥B*¡¦ Clang gives a similar error Working: class A;
class B;

template <class T> auto foo()  { // automatic return type deduction
  A *pa = nullptr;
  return static_cast<T *>(pa);
}

class A {};
class B : public A {};

auto test() { return foo<B>(); }
 Why it is happening? Why is that the rule about the end of compilation unit beeing considered a point of instantiation doesn't make the template instantiation legitimate anymore?
@CODE:class A;
class B;

template <class T> auto foo() -> T * {
  A *pa = nullptr; // ignore pa being `nullptr`.

Where this gets tricky is that I have some text that I wish to display under each image that should wrap with the image width as well (and as I said, the image width may vary).

@LINK:/questions/34049849/convoluted-tree-structure-causes-the-gc-to-pause-indefinitely
@TITLE:Convoluted tree structure causes the GC to pause indefinitely
@CONTENT:I am doing some machine learning self study and currently I am implementing reverse mode automatic differentiation as practice. The way the program works is by essentially overloading common expressions like multiplication, addition and so on and building up a tree whose nodes will subsequently be called on the backwards pass from top to bottom. This is probably the first time I used closures in F# and I quite like them, but unfortunately I am suspecting them of choking the GC, though I do not know how to verify that. I'd rather ask first here than redesign the algorithm so it does not use them as they are quite handy. The said tree is built up many times during the program run and I am counting on the garbage collector to dispose of it. At the bottom of the program is the main loop that trains a 2 layer net on the XOR problem. Calling GC.Collect() before the loop or after the loop and then running it again causes it to go into indefinite hiatus. Here are the data structures I am using. I would like some advice whether my hunch is correct and I should redesign the algorithm to not use closures or whether something else is at fault. type dMatrix(num_rows:int,num_cols,dArray: DeviceMemory<float32>) = 
    inherit DisposableObject()

    new(num_rows,num_cols) =
        new dMatrix(num_rows,num_cols,worker.Malloc<float32>(num_rows*num_cols))

    member t.num_rows = num_rows
    member t.num_cols = num_cols
    member t.dArray = dArray

    override net.Dispose(disposing:bool) =
        if disposing then
            dArray.Dispose()

type Df_rec = {
    P: float32 
    mutable c : int 
    mutable A : float32
    }

type DM_rec = {
    P: dMatrix 
    mutable c : int 
    mutable A : dMatrix
    }

type Rf =
    | DfR_Df_DM of Df_rec * (float32 -> dMatrix) * RDM
    | DfR_Df_Df of Df_rec * (float32 -> float32) * Rf

and RDM = 
    | DM of DM_rec
    | DMRb of DM_rec * (dMatrix -> dMatrix) * (dMatrix -> dMatrix) * RDM * RDM // Outside node * left derivative function * right derivative func * prev left node * prev right node.
    | DMRu of DM_rec * (dMatrix -> dMatrix) * RDM
 It uses many of the functions such as the one below. The sgemm is the cuBLAS sgemm wrapper. fl out and fr out are the closures. They are convenient, but GC might find the challenging to clean up the tree. let matmult (a: RDM) (b:RDM) =
    let mm va vb =
        let c = sgemm nT nT 1.0f va vb
        let fl out = sgemm nT T 1.0f out vb // The derivative with respect to the left. So the above argument gets inserted from the right left. Usually error * input.
        let fr out = sgemm T nT 1.0f va out // The derivative with respect to the right. So the above argument gets inserted from the right side. Usually weights * error.
        DMRb(DM_rec.create c,fl,fr,a,b)
    let va = a.r.P
    let vb = b.r.P
    mm va vb
 Ideally, I would reuse the tree, but as AD could propagate error gradients through loops and branches that is not an option and the program has to do a lot of dynamic allocation even if it slow. Any advice of how to dispose of these trees efficiently? Thanks. Here is the link to the Github page with the full program. Edit: I've converted the code to not use closures and yet it still crashes upon garbage collection. I am not sure what is going on under the hood. Edit2: It finally occurred to me to use the debugger and I see that I am getting 'System.AccessViolationException' thrown by the Alea library. It might be related to the earlier error I reported in the sum module. In fact I saw a misaligned access one or twice before, but my brain just ignored it for some reason. I'll try to isolate the error tomorrow. Edit3: Resolved the issue. It was due to the faulty Alea reduce module and had nothing to do with closures or the tree structure that I was using. Also I've verified that there is no reason not to use closures as they do not involve any kind of performance penalty compared to explicitly passing along the parameters. That is nice and surprising.

@TITLE:Lambda treated as a closed delegate in Visual Studio 2015
@CONTENT:I was surprised that there would be any runtime difference between these two delegates (fn1 and fn2): static int SomeStaticMethod(int x) { return x; }

// fn1.Target == null in this case
Func<int, int> fn1 = SomeStaticMethod;

// fn2.Target != null in this case
Func<int, int> fn2 = x => x;
 But apparently the second lambda is treated like an instance method, because its Target property is non-null. And it was treated differently before I switched to Visual Studio 2015 (in VS2012, I am pretty sure it was treated as a static method). Is there a reason why a lambda with no closures is treated as a closed delegate (i.e. an instance method) in C#? I thought perhaps it's the debugger adding some stuff, but it also happens in release builds. (Clarification) The point is, I had a method like this which created a generic delegate for quickly converting from enums to ints (without boxing): private static Func<int, TEnum> CreateIntToEnumDelegate()
{
    Func<int, int> lambda = x => x;
    return Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(Func<int, TEnum>), lambda.Method) 
        as Func<int, TEnum>;
}
 and it didn't work in Roslyn anymore, because the "instance" lambda became incompatible with the delegate signature. So I had to use a static method instead, no big deal. But what worries me is that this was impossible to catch during compile-time. This thread describes similar issues, btw, now that I searched for "Roslyn delegates".
@CODE:fn1 fn2 static int SomeStaticMethod(int x) { return x; }

// fn1.Target == null in this case
Func<int, int> fn1 = SomeStaticMethod;

Unfortunately there seems to be no way to configure logging via environment variables.

@TITLE:How to publish a constant string in the Rust FFI?
@CONTENT:I want to have a Rust library expose a const char * static string to C, to be compatible with an existing interface (specifically librsync). That is, the C header file has extern char const *my_string;
 In C, the library would simply have char const *my_string = "hi";
 In Rust I've tried something like pub static my_string: *const libc::c_char = unsafe { "hi\0" as *const libc::c_char };
 but this complains error: casting `&'static str` as `*const i8` is invalid
 It seems like I can't use CString etc because they won't be a compile-time constant expression.
@CODE:const char * extern char const *my_string; char const *my_string = "hi"; pub static my_string: *const libc::c_char = unsafe { "hi\0" as *const libc::c_char }; error: casting `&'static str` as `*const i8` is invalid CString

@TITLE:Does the Java regex library optimize for any characters .*?
@CONTENT:I have a wrapper class for matching regular expressions. Obviously, you compile a regular expression into a Pattern like this. Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
 But suppose I used a .* to specify any number of characters. So it's basically a wildcard. Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(".*");
 Does the pattern optimize to always return true and not really calculate anything? Or should I have my wrapper implement that optimization? I am doing this because I could easily process hundreds of thousands of regex operations in a process. If a regex parameter is null I coalesce it to a .*

@TITLE:Securing CRTP: is private destructor the only solution?
@CONTENT:How to avoid template <typename Derived>
struct base { int foo() { return static_cast<Derived*>(this)->bar(); } };

struct derived : base<derived> { int bar(); };        
struct another_derived : base<derived> { int bar(); };  // error: wrong base
 without additional code in derived classes? This has been asked twice before (though without the extra condition of avoiding additional code in derived classes), with the recommended answer template <typename Derived>
struct base {
  int foo() { return static_cast<Derived*>(this)->bar(); } 
private:
  ~base() {}
  friend Derived;
};
 However, this not only secures against above error, but also makes all private members of Base accessible from Derived. Is there an alternative, which avoids that? Or can it be conclusively shown that this is impossible? edit I actually have a more complex problem, where in addition to usual usage (as above) there is also template<typename Derived>
struct intermediate : base<Derived>
{
  int bar() { return static_cast<Derived*>(this)->ark(); }
};
 when the private destructor trick fails (since intermediate is not befriended by base).
@CODE:template <typename Derived>
struct base { int foo() { return static_cast<Derived*>(this)->bar(); } };

struct derived : base<derived> { int bar(); };        
struct another_derived : base<derived> { int bar(); };  // error: wrong base template <typename Derived>
struct base {

@TITLE:Serve static file index.html by default
@CONTENT:I've got a very simple angular app project that needs to do nothing more than serve static files from wwwroot. Here is my Startup.cs: public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {

 Whenever I launch the project with IIS Express or web I always have to navigate to /index.html. How do I make it so that I can just visit the root (/) and still get index.html?

@CONTENT:I was wondering if there is any optimized way to create an adapter that holds more than 1k object in it. I have tried the following but still the results were not promising . A.View holder pattern-It helped but when the object size increased it started have issues B.Note: I could have used a paginated api which passes a defined number of objects but I annot have paginated Api in my scenerio. C.My list do have images in it but I have taken care of that.Its not a problem now. Let me know of any new ways to achieve a adapter that can have a large number of object list in it without any issues.

@TITLE:Database polling with Reactive Extensions
@CONTENT:I have to query a database in a timely fashion to know the state of a legacy system. I've thought of wrapping the query around an Observable, but I don't know the correct way to do it. Basically, it will be the same query every 5 seconds. But I'm afraid I will have to face these problems: What if the execution of the query takes 10 seconds? I don't want to execute any new query if the previous is still being processed. Also, there should be a timeout. If the current query doesn't execute after, for example, 20 seconds, an informative message should be logged and a new attempt (the same query) should be sent. Extra details: The query is just a SELECT that returns a dataset with a list of status codes (working, faulted). The Observable sequence will always take the latest data received from the query, something like the Switch extension method. I would like to wrap the database query (lenghty operation) into a Task, but I'm not sure if it's the best option. I'm almost sure that the query should be executed in another thread, but I have no idea of how the observable should look like, ever having read Introduction to Rx by Lee Campbell.

@TITLE:Python 3.4.3 tkinter - Program freezes on declaration of IntVar or any other tkinter data type
@CONTENT:Previous thread: Python 3.4 tkinter checkbutton variable handling not working / responding Following a long thread the problem appears to be related to the declaration of an IntVar before root.mainloop() is run. Apparently the code from the previous thread works with Python 2.6.6 (thanks to PM 2Ring) once syntactical changes are made. You can see the full code on the previous thread. Here is a (roughly) Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example: import tkinter as tk

class Thing(tk.Frame):

    def Switch(self):
        if self.anyVar.get():
            state = "disabled"
        else:
            state = "normal"
        print(state)

        self.entry.configure(state=state)

    def createWidgets(self):

        ### This is the problem.
        print("testbefore")
        self.anyVar = tk.IntVar()
        print("testafter")
        ### End of problem. testafter is never printed. BUT WHY?!?!

        tk.Label(self,text="Test",font=("Times New Roman",15)).grid(row=0,column=0,sticky="W",padx=5,pady=5)
        self.box = tk.Checkbutton(self,variable=self.anyVar,command=self.Switch)
        self.box.grid(row=1,column=1,sticky="W",padx=0,pady=5)
        self.entry = tk.Entry(self,width=2)
        self.entry.grid(row=2,column=1,sticky="W",padx=2,pady=5)

    def __init__(self, parent):

        tk.Frame.__init__(self, parent)
        self.pack()
        self.parent = parent
        self.createWidgets()

class Framework(tk.Frame):

    def __init__(self, parent):

        tk.Frame.__init__(self, parent)
        self.instances = []
        self.parent = parent
        thing = Thing(self)
        self.instances.append(thing)

    def Activity(self):

        self.Clear()
        self.instances[0].pack()


def Initialise(window):
    window.master = tk.Frame(window)
    window.master.grid()
    window.instances = Framework(window.master)
    window.instances.grid()

root = tk.Tk()
Initialise(root)
root.mainloop()
root.destroy()
 The code will execute until self.anyVar = tk.IntVar() is reached, at which point the program freezes but no error message is given. "testafter" is never printed. Any idea why this is? Thanks.

@CONTENT:When you use plot function in Matlab, you are presented with y and x axis on the left and at the bottom respectively. But I'd like the x-axis to strike through in the middle of the figure with the scales and numbers like so: I beg a pardon for my amateur paint skills. But basically I want the x-axis to move to the top for example and I want to have numbers there and those small bumps like indicated on the red line but all the way through to the right, but I do not want a number under each "bump" just the whole numbers. I tried to google the answer but couldn't find anything. Clearly, I do not want two x-axis, so ideally the one at the bottom would be gone.

@TITLE:Converting to Jython a Python 3.5 project - UnicodeDecodeError: 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 4-10: illegal Unicode character
@CONTENT:My final purpose is to convert a running Python project to Jython interpreter because some java API's are going to be added. Details: The latest Jython is 2.7 The project I have is runnable with Python 3.5 So I took the following approach: First thing was to convert my project to Python 2.7 utilizing the future module and pasteurize executable. This step was done successfully. Second thing is to convert the Python 2.7 project to a Jython 2.7 Project. Switching the interpreter at Eclipse mars, the following error was indicated: console: Failed to install '': java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: cp0.
 To workaround it, the solution from this post was utilized by passing the encoding argument -Dpython.console.encoding=UTF-8 to the java VM according to figure below: Thumbs were up when trying to run again. But unfortunately here, the error shown below just appeared. As I don't plan to change any imported module if there's no need to do so, I decided to ask help here. pydev debugger: starting (pid: 4216)

 Does anybody have a clue of how to solve this error in the most elegant manner? A bug was created at Jython.org with a critical severity because many people are utilizing already the latest Python modules and interpreter. And they might want to add Java functionality to their code. So they would basically have to take same path as I did. Backporting the project to Python 2.7 then to Jython 2.7 subsequentely. At python-future a feature request bug was recorded too.

@TITLE:All sandbox testers created through iTunes Connect request ¡§Payment Information Required¡¨
@CONTENT:I'm having an issue recently that I didn't seem to run into before with my iOS sandbox testers and In-App Purchases. I've done the following: Create a new sandbox tester that hasn't been used before. Assign to United States. Log out of all iTunes accounts on the device. Open app and go through In-App Purchase flow. Log in via the new itunes sandbox account. This usually works for me. But now I'm getting a prompt that says "Payment Information Required - To subscribe, add a new payment method. You'll only be charged when your trial ends. [Environment: Sandbox]". I've seen similar SO questions that mention that they created the sandbox user in the wrong country or had previously registered a valid existing account. None of these are applicable in my situation. Anyone else running into this right now? Any suggestions?

@LINK:/questions/33553265/using-initializer-lists-with-stdmap
@TITLE:Using Initializer Lists with std::map
@CONTENT:I asked an earlier question, which got off-topic in CString and Unicode issues. I've now reduced my example to namespace std and cout (instead of printf). But the core problem still remains. This is related to, but separate from the question nominated as a duplicate. That question is about maps-in-maps, and is over 2 years old, with the note that the issue is a priority for the compiler team. (Clearly it is not a priority) This question is worthy of staying open Am I using the Initializers properly? Is there any simple way to fix this without a major workaround? (This is a minimal example based on a much more complex program) #include <map>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

struct Params
{
    int         inputType;
    std::string moduleName;
};

int main()
{
    std::map<std::string, Params> options{
        { "Add",       { 30, "RecordLib" } },
        { "Open",      { 40, "ViewLib"   } },
        { "Close",     { 50, "EditLib"   } },
        { "Inventory", { 60, "ControlLib"} },
        { "Report",    { 70, "ReportLib" } }
    };

    for (const auto& pair : options)
    {
        std::cout << "Entry: " << pair.first << " ==> { " << pair.second.moduleName << "    }" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
 Output Entry:  ==> {  }
Entry: Report ==> {    }
 You can see only the final string "Report" survived. It really looks to me like the intializer list for std::map is just broken. I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, with Unicode. This happens in both Debug and Release builds, with Optimizations Disabled or /O2 The same code works fine on IDEOne
@CODE:namespace std cout printf #include <map>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

struct Params
{
    int         inputType;
    std::string moduleName;
};

int main()
{
    std::map<std::string, Params> options{
        { "Add",       { 30, "RecordLib" } },
        { "Open",      { 40, "ViewLib"   } },
        { "Close",     { 50, "EditLib"   } },
        { "Inventory", { 60, "ControlLib"} },
        { "Report",    { 70, "ReportLib" } }
    };

    for (const auto& pair : options)
    {
        std::cout << "Entry: " << pair.first << " ==> { " << pair.second.moduleName << "    }" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
} Entry:  ==> {  }
Entry: Report ==> {    } "Report" std::map Debug Release Optimizations Disabled /O2 Am I using the Initializers properly?

@TITLE:How to create a parse _User account from a Android Google token?
@CONTENT:I've found some fragments of useful information. http://blog.parse.com/announcements/bring-your-own-login/ shows me how to login an Android app once I have a Parse token. I can successfully obtain a Google token for a phone's Google account. https://developers.google.com/android/guides/http-auth /**
 * Gets an authentication token from Google and handles any
 * GoogleAuthException that may occur.
 */
protected String fetchToken() throws IOException {
    try {

        // GooglePlayServices.apk is either old, disabled, or not present
        // so we need to show the user some UI in the activity to recover.
        mActivity.handleGoogleException(userRecoverableException);

        // Some other type of unrecoverable exception has occurred.
        // Report and log the error as appropriate for your app.
    }
    return null;
}
 How can get Parse to use a Google token to create a Parse token? I assume that this will involve writing some Cloud Code, but I'm not clear on what that Cloud Code should do. I think it needs to create or find a new _User for the Google token and return the Parse token. Are there any Parse Cloud Code examples of how to handle Google Android login/signup, or examples of anything other than Faceboook/Twitter?
@CODE:/**

@TITLE:MySql Logical Order By
@CONTENT:I currently have query like this: SELECT 'id', 'clanid', 'name',
       'level', 'exp', 'warwinpercent',
       'warswon', 'warslost', 'warstied',
       'playercount', 'score'
FROM clans
WHERE warswon >= 100
ORDER BY warwinpercent DESC, warswon DESC;
 Now that works but in the end it isn't as logical as I would hope it could be... For example. Let's say there is a row which has 99.5738% war win percent and 208 wars won. And another which has 100% war win percent and 103 wars won. I'd want the 99% row to be above the 100% row. Is there any way for me to get this working? An equation I'd have is: warinpercent = warswon/(warswon+warstied+warlost)*100
order by warwinpercent
if warwinpercent are in a range of 3% then order by warswon between them.
@CODE:SELECT 'id', 'clanid', 'name',
       'level', 'exp', 'warwinpercent',
       'warswon', 'warslost', 'warstied',
       'playercount', 'score'
FROM clans
WHERE warswon >= 100
ORDER BY warwinpercent DESC, warswon DESC; warinpercent = warswon/(warswon+warstied+warlost)*100
order by warwinpercent
if warwinpercent are in a range of 3% then order by warswon between them.

@TITLE:Java generics - Does Java need support for locally defined types?
@CONTENT:I am hoping to reach the Java generics experts here. Let's say you have some typed class: public interface SomeClass<T> {
    void doSomething(final T t);
}
 There is also a function which gets you an instance of T given an instance of SomeClass<T>: public static class Retriever {
    public <T> T get(final SomeClass<T> c) {
        return null; // actual implementation left out
    }
}
 Now let's say you have a collection of SomeClass<?> and a retriever: final List<SomeClass<?>> myClasses   = null; // actual implementation left out
final Retriever          myRetriever = null; // actual implementation left out
 We are not able to do the following: for (final SomeClass<?> myClass : myClasses) {
    myClass.doSomething(myRetriever.get(myClass));
}
 Now my question: does Java need support to be able to locally define a type? Something like: <T> for (final SomeClass<T> myClass : myClasses) {
    myClass.doSomething(myRetriever.get(myClass));
}
 Here, the type T is scoped to the for-loop. We are defining T to get rid of the wildcard ?. That's it. The introduction of T should enable us to write the desired for loop as expressed above. FWIW, the following code is a workaround. We are introducing a function, solely for the conversion of ? to T. for (final SomeClass<?> myClass : myClasses) {
    workAround(myRetriever, myClass);
}

public static <T> void workAround(final Retriever myRetriever, final SomeClass<T> myClass) {
    myClass.doSomething(myRetriever.get(myClass));
}
 A locally defined user type might be a more elegant solution?
@CODE:public interface SomeClass<T> {
    void doSomething(final T t);
} T SomeClass<T> public static class Retriever {
    public <T> T get(final SomeClass<T> c) {
        return null; // actual implementation left out
    }
} SomeClass<?> final List<SomeClass<?>> myClasses   = null; // actual implementation left out
final Retriever          myRetriever = null; // actual implementation left out for (final SomeClass<?> myClass : myClasses) {
    myClass.doSomething(myRetriever.get(myClass));
} <T> for (final SomeClass<T> myClass : myClasses) {
    myClass.doSomething(myRetriever.get(myClass));
} T T ? T ? T for (final SomeClass<?> myClass : myClasses) {
    workAround(myRetriever, myClass);
}

public static <T> void workAround(final Retriever myRetriever, final SomeClass<T> myClass) {
    myClass.doSomething(myRetriever.get(myClass));

@TITLE:Report Viewer control not showing report from SSRS
@CONTENT:I'm using MS Report Viewer 10 in VS 2013; the project is being upgraded from VS 2010. I have worked through a series of issues relating to Report Viewer, and have the control itself up and running. I have a number of reports in SSRS, and I have confirmed that the reports themselves work properly. I have a Web Forms ASPX page for data input. It passes data via JSON to a popup ASPX page that contains the Report Viewer control. I am running IIS Express 7, SQL Server 2008 R2 (v10.50), and a current target framework of .NET Framework 4.5. Report Viewer does not return any report -- no error message, no report layout missing data, and certainly no complete report. When I run the same report with the same inputs through VS, the report preview shows the results I expect. ProcessingMode is set to Remote and ReportServerCredentials is null. I researched what this means, and it means that Report Viewer should connect to SSRS with the current network credentials, namely the current user. I confirmed that the current user correctly matches my current login; I can connect to SSRS and SQL Server using Windows authentication properly. ReportViewer doesn't create in the web form designer, so I can't set any properties on it at design time. So I suspect my issue is a matter of authentication at run time. I am out of ideas on how to investiagte and resolve this. The control code on the page:     <ssrs:ReportViewer ID="ReportViewer" runat="server" ProcessingMode="Remote" Width="100%"
        Height="690" ShowParameterPrompts="false" AsyncRendering="false"/>
 The SSRS log contains the following entries after I attempt to run the report: library!ReportServer_0-3!1dc8!(datetime): i INFO: RenderForNewSession('(report)')
webserver!ReportServer_0-3!1dc8!(datetime, 1 second later): i INFO: Processed report. Report='(report)', Stream=''
 The legacy project used MS Report Viewer 9. It ran just fine. The only changes I see in web.config relate to the later version and a change from IIS 6 to IIS 7. Since it came up in comments, here's the relevant line from web.config: <system.webServer>

 My Report Viewer window: ETA 24 Nov: I eventually got an entry in the application log: HttpHandlerInputException, Missing URL parameter: IterationId. This issue has been discussed at another STOF Q&A.

@LINK:/questions/33312362/generate-the-dominant-colors-for-an-rgb-image-with-xmlhttprequest
@TITLE:Generate the Dominant Colors for an RGB image with XMLHttpRequest
@CONTENT:A Note For Readers: This is a long question, but it needs a background to understand the question asked. The color quantization technique is commonly used to get the dominant colors of an image. One of the well-known libraries that do color quantization is Leptonica through the Modified Median Cut Quantization (MMCQ) and octree quantization (OQ) Github's Color-thief by @lokesh is a very simple implementation in JavaScript of the MMCQ algorithm: var colorThief = new ColorThief();
colorThief.getColor(sourceImage);
 Technically, the image on a <img/> HTML element is backed on a <canvas/> element: var CanvasImage = function (image) {
    this.canvas  = document.createElement('canvas');
    this.context = this.canvas.getContext('2d');

    document.body.appendChild(this.canvas);

    this.width  = this.canvas.width  = image.width;
    this.height = this.canvas.height = image.height;

    this.context.drawImage(image, 0, 0, this.width, this.height);
};
 And that is the problem with TVML, as we will see later on. Another implementation I recently came to know was linked on this article Using imagemagick, awk and kmeans to find dominant colors in images that links to Using python to generate awesome linux desktop themes. The author posted an article about Using python and k-means to find the dominant colors in images that was used there (sorry for all those links, but I'm following back my History...). The author was super productive, and added a JavaScript version too that I'm posting here: Using JavaScript and k-means to find the dominant colors in images In this case, we are generating the dominant colors of an image, not using the MMCQ (or OQ) algorithm, but K-Means. The problem is that the image must be a as well: <canvas id="canvas" style="display: none;" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
 and then function analyze(img_elem) {
        var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d')
          , img = new Image();
        img.onload = function() {
          var results = document.getElementById('results');
          results.innerHTML = 'Waiting...';
          var colors = process_image(img, ctx)
            , p1 = document.getElementById('c1')
            , p2 = document.getElementById('c2')
            , p3 = document.getElementById('c3');
          p1.style.backgroundColor = colors[0];
          p2.style.backgroundColor = colors[1];
          p3.style.backgroundColor = colors[2];
          results.innerHTML = 'Done';
        }
        img.src = img_elem.src;
      }
 This is because the Canvas has a getContext() method, that expose 2D image drawing APIs - see An introduction to the Canvas 2D API This context ctx is passed to the image processing function   function process_image(img, ctx) {
    var points = [];
    ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 200, 200);
    data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 200, 200).data;
    for (var i = 0, l = data.length; i < l;  i += 4) {
      var r = data[i]
        , g = data[i+1]
        , b = data[i+2];
      points.push([r, g, b]);
    }
    var results = kmeans(points, 3, 1)
     , hex = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
      hex.push(rgbToHex(results[i][0]));
    }
    return hex;
  }
 So you can draw an image on the Canvas through the Context and get image data: ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 200, 200);
data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 200, 200).data;
 Another nice solution is in CoffeeScript, ColorTunes, but this is using a as well: ColorTunes.getColorMap = function(canvas, sx, sy, w, h, nc) {
    var index, indexBase, pdata, pixels, x, y, _i, _j, _ref, _ref1;
    if (nc == null) {
      nc = 8;
    }
    pdata = canvas.getContext("2d").getImageData(sx, sy, w, h).data;
    pixels = [];
    for (y = _i = sy, _ref = sy + h; _i < _ref; y = _i += 1) {
      indexBase = y * w * 4;
      for (x = _j = sx, _ref1 = sx + w; _j < _ref1; x = _j += 1) {
        index = indexBase + (x * 4);
        pixels.push([pdata[index], pdata[index + 1], pdata[index + 2]]);
      }
    }
    return (new MMCQ).quantize(pixels, nc);
  };
 But, wait, we have no <canvas/> element in TVML! Of course, there are native solutions like Objective-C ColorCube, DominantColor - this is using K-means and the very nice and reusable ColorArt by @AaronBrethorst from CocoaControls. Despite the fact that this could be used in a TVML application through a native to JavaScriptCore bridge - see How to bridge TVML/JavaScriptCore to UIKit/Objective-C (Swift)? my aim is to make this work completely in TVJS and TVML. The simplest MMCQ JavaScript implementation does not need a Canvas: see Basic Javascript port of the MMCQ (modified median cut quantization) by Nick Rabinowitz, but needs the RGB array of the image: var cmap = MMCQ.quantize(pixelArray, colorCount);
 that is taken from the HTML <canvas/> and that is the reason for it! function createPalette(sourceImage, colorCount) {

    // Create custom CanvasImage object
    var image = new CanvasImage(sourceImage),
        imageData = image.getImageData(),
        pixels = imageData.data,
        pixelCount = image.getPixelCount();

    // Store the RGB values in an array format suitable for quantize function
    var pixelArray = [];
    for (var i = 0, offset, r, g, b, a; i < pixelCount; i++) {
        offset = i * 4;
        r = pixels[offset + 0];
        g = pixels[offset + 1];
        b = pixels[offset + 2];
        a = pixels[offset + 3];
        // If pixel is mostly opaque and not white
        if (a >= 125) {
            if (!(r > 250 && g > 250 && b > 250)) {
                pixelArray.push([r, g, b]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Send array to quantize function which clusters values
    // using median cut algorithm

    var cmap = MMCQ.quantize(pixelArray, colorCount);
    var palette = cmap.palette();

    // Clean up
    image.removeCanvas();

    return palette;
}
 [QUESTION] How to generate the dominant colors of a RGB image without using the HTML5 <canvas/>, but in pure JavaScript from an image's ByteArray fetched with XMLHttpRequest? [UPDATE] I have posted this question to Color-Thief github repo, adapting the RGB array calculations to the latest codebase. The solution I have tried was this ColorThief.prototype.getPaletteNoCanvas = function(sourceImageURL, colorCount, quality, done) {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', sourceImageURL, true);
  xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
  xhr.onload = function(e) {
    if (this.status == 200) {

      var uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(this.response);
      var i = uInt8Array.length;
      var biStr = new Array(i);
      while (i--)
      { biStr[i] = String.fromCharCode(uInt8Array[i]);
      }

      if (typeof colorCount === 'undefined') {
          colorCount = 10;
      }
      if (typeof quality === 'undefined' || quality < 1) {
          quality = 10;
      }

      var pixels     = uInt8Array;
      var pixelCount = 152 * 152 * 4 // this should be width*height*4

      // Store the RGB values in an array format suitable for quantize function
      var pixelArray = [];
      for (var i = 0, offset, r, g, b, a; i < pixelCount; i = i + quality) {
          offset = i * 4;
          r = pixels[offset + 0];
          g = pixels[offset + 1];
          b = pixels[offset + 2];
          a = pixels[offset + 3];
          // If pixel is mostly opaque and not white
          if (a >= 125) {
              if (!(r > 250 && g > 250 && b > 250)) {
                  pixelArray.push([r, g, b]);
              }
          }
      }

      // Send array to quantize function which clusters values
      // using median cut algorithm
      var cmap    = MMCQ.quantize(pixelArray, colorCount);
      var palette = cmap? cmap.palette() : null;
      done.apply(this,[ palette ])

    } // 200
  };
  xhr.send();
}
 but it does not gives back the right RGB colors array. [UPDATE] Thanks to all the suggestions I got it working. Now a full example is available on Github,

@TITLE:Start debugging on C# startup project in native-only mode
@CONTENT:I have a MSVC2013 solution with C# (managed) and C++ (native) projects. One C# project is set as startup project. I want to start this project with debugging, which is usually achieved in devenv by simply pressing F5. However, I want to start debugger in native-only mode (i.e. no managed debugging). I cannot achieve this behavior by changing settings of C# project: it only has an option "Enable native code debugging", which allows to enable or disable native debugging. The only standard way I know is to start application without debugging, and then attach to process with only native debugging chosen. Is there a way to automate this process? Ideally, pressing one button should be enough to start native-only debugging. Perhaps some extension could simplify this task. P.S. I have bumped into a nasty bug in mixed mode debugging, which breaks debugging completely in my case. This bug itself is not the topic of the question, it just explains why native-only debugging with C# startup project may be useful (and is useful to me personally).

@TITLE:Printing text in form of circle
@CONTENT:I'm trying to form figures of the text a person chooses. I already made a square, pyramid and a parallelogram. Where I get stuck is when I'm trying to make a circle. My thought was to use a for i in range (1, height/2) where it would print the text (f.e. --) * i times. Then I wanted another for loop to print the exact opposite, so from height/2 to height, it should first print height/2* text en for every time the for loop starts again, it should print the text one time less. I'm not completely sure if this will look like a circle somehow. I'll give my code for a pyramid and a circle. I'm aware that for the circle, I still need to do something with " ", but as I don't really know how to get everything working in the first place, I haven't began thinking about how I'm gonna need blank spaces in that code. def print_pyramid(height):
    text = raw_input("Please give in what your pyramid needs to be formed from, you can choose two **, two --, or two letters")
    for i in range(1,height+1):
         print (height-i+1)*" ", text * i

def print_circle(height):
    text = raw_input("Give in what your circle is made of: **, -- or two letters.")
    for i in range(1,height/2):

@CONTENT:I am using HTML bridge window.print() to print range between 20-30. The client says it is printing blank pages. We can only reproduce it on their machine. This is the code in xaml that combines all the pages in one page and prints it. This code works and prints all pages for me. We need this only on IE I am using windows 8 and IE 10. But for the client it prints one blank page with the header and footer url. It works correctly if he prints the current page or prints all the pages from start to end. But if he tries to print range, 23-30, it only prints 23-27 or so. Sometimes it prints just one blank page with the header and footer url. Unfortunately none of these happen on my machine. The client said that they tried it on IE 8, IE 9 and IE 11. Can some suggest what are my options or what are the things I could look out for Page.xaml.cs

 What is this smallest integer value of the parameter x, so that the returned value is greater than 1.000.000 ? Right now I am just doing it by trial and error and since this question is asked via a paper format. I don't think I will have enough time to do trial and error. Question is, how do you guys visualise this quickly such that it can be solved easily. Thanks guys and I am new to programming so thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Google Authentication with a Backend Server required Scopes
@CONTENT:I am following these instructions (https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/backend-auth) for getting an ID token to be sent to my Backend but when I set String scopes = "audience:server:client_id:" + Service.SERVER_CLIENT_ID; (Yes the SERVER_CLIENT_ID is not the Android Client ID) I fail to get a token and throws this error. E/Login: com.google.android.gms.auth.GoogleAuthException: Unknown However when I use the following scope instead String scopes = "oauth2:profile email"; I successfully get 'a' token but it's not as long as I expected it to be and I'm afraid it might be wrong. My questions are... 1) Why doesn't the scopes = "audience:server:client_id:" + SERVER_CLIENT_ID; used in the guide work? 2) Is the token I get from using String scopes = "oauth2:profile email"; a safe one for verifying a user on a Backend?

@TITLE:Can't get access to string localizations in UI Test (Xcode 7)
@CONTENT:So I have a situation in which I have a few textFields that are validated. I'm trying to run a UI test, and when they fail they will get an alert to pop up with an error message (potentially a different message depending on what fields are invalid and in what way). I'd like to test that not only that an alert appeared, but that the correct message is displayed. The problem I'm having is that I need to get the localized text for comparison (if I run tests in another language other than english), but when I call NSLocalizedString in the UITest it can't gather the correct localized string (just returns the key [default]) I've tried adding the localizeable.strings files to the UITest target, but to no avail. Does anyone know if this is possible? edit as a side note: I also tried setting an accessibility identifier on the UIAlertView but when I query with that accessibility identifier it doesn't exist, I can only query it using the title of the alert which seems backwards.

@LINK:/questions/33064376/extract-information-on-usage-of-functions-and-packages-in-r-scripts
@TITLE:Extract information on usage of functions and packages in R scripts
@CONTENT:What would be a proper way to extract function calls and their occuring line in one or more R scripts? Is there a parsing base function or package that allows me to do this or should I build a solution with regular expressions? For example: function_calls("project1/exploratory_analysis.R")
 should output a dataframe like: ##    function  line                filename
## 1    tapply    35  exploratory_analysis.R
## 2     qplot    80  exploratory_analysis.R
 What I want to achieve finally is to build a reverse index of function calls and loaded packages as used in one or more R scripts, for educational and reference purposes. (e.g. used as a repository with examples of usage). For example: --------------------------------------------------------    
| function |       source_file      | line  |  package |
|:--------:|:----------------------:|:-----:|:--------:|
|  tapply  | exploratory_analysis.R |   35  |   base   |
|   qplot  | exploratory_analysis.R |   80  |  ggplot2 |
|    cor   |      regression.R      |   15  |   stats  |
|    cor   |      regression.R      |   27  |   stats  |
|  tapply  |      regression.R      |   12  |   base   |
| fromJSON |     load_dataset.R     |   5   | jsonlite |
|    %>%   |    transformation.R    |   10  | magrittr |
--------------------------------------------------------
 One could use some regular expressions to extract function calls but I was wondering whether there exists a parsing, static code analysis or reflection facility supporting this task. I suppose combining parse(), substitute(), getParseData(), deParse(), srcfile() (or maybe functions in the packages mvbutils, codetools) would make it possible, but I'm not familiar enough with their usage to figure it out on my own.

@TITLE:How do I deal with many levels of indentation?
@CONTENT:I am writing a script that has a very logically complicated loop: main = do
    inFH <- openFile "..." ReadMode
    outFH <- openFile "..." WriteMode

    forM myList $ \ item ->
        ...

                            ...
 The code soon flies to the right, so I was thinking breaking it into pieces, using for example where clauses. The problem is, many of these ... contain reading/writing statements to the two handles inFH and outFH, and using a where statement will render those two names out of context. I would have to send in these two variables everytime I use a where statement. Is there a better way of dealing with this?

@TITLE:Leads a C++11 std::mutex lock the blocked thread into a passive wait state?
@CONTENT:I have the following situation: Two C++11 threads are working on a calculation and they are synchronized through a std::mutex. Thread A locks the mutex until the data is ready for the operation Thread B executes. When the mutex is unlocked Thread B starts to work. Thread B tries to lock the mutex and is blocked until it is unlocked by Thread A. void ThreadA (std::mutex* mtx, char* data)
{
    mtx->lock();
    //do something useful with data
    mtx->unlock();
}

void ThreadB (std::mutex* mtx, char* data)
{
    mtx->lock(); //wait until Thread A is ready
    //do something useful with data
    //.....
}
 It is asserted that Thread A can block the mutex first. Now I am wondering if the mtx->lock() in Thread B waits active or passive. So is Thread B polling the mutex state and wasting processor time or is released passively by the sheduler when the mutex is unlocked. In the different C++ references it is only mentioned that the thread is blocked, but not in which way. Could it be, however, that the std::mutex implementation is hardly depended on the used plattform and OS?
@CODE:void ThreadA (std::mutex* mtx, char* data)
{
    mtx->lock();
    //do something useful with data
    mtx->unlock();
}

void ThreadB (std::mutex* mtx, char* data)

    mtx->lock(); //wait until Thread A is ready
    //do something useful with data
    //.....

@TITLE:Amount of repetitions of symbols in Lua pattern setup
@CONTENT:I'm looking for amount of repetitions of symbols in Lua pattern setup. I try to check amount of symbols in a string. As I read in manual, Even with character classes this is still very limiting, because we can only match strings with a fixed length. To solve this, patterns support these four repetition operators: '*' Match the previous character (or class) zero or more times, as many times as possible. '+' Match the previous character (or class) one or more times, as many times as possible. '-' Match the previous character (or class) zero or more times, as few times as possible. '?' Make the previous character (or class) optional. So, no information about Braces {} e.g., {1,10}; {1,}; {10};
 doesn't work. local np = '1'
local a =  np:match('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1}$' )
 returns np = nil. local np = '1{1}'
local a =  np:match('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1}$' )
 returns np = '1{1}' :) This url says that no such magic symbols: Some characters, called magic characters, have special meanings when used in a pattern. The magic characters are ( ) . % + - * ? [ ^ $
 Curly brackets do work only as simple text and no more. Am I right? What is the best way to avoid this 'bug'? It is possible to read usual usage of braces, for instance, here.
@CODE:{} {1,10}; {1,}; {10}; local np = '1'
local a =  np:match('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1}$' ) np = nil local np = '1{1}'

@LINK:/questions/32863095/expected-behavior-for-aws-kinesis-sharditeratortype-trim-horizon
@TITLE:Expected behavior for AWS Kinesis ShardIteratorType TRIM_HORIZON
@CONTENT:Context: I'm not necessarily referring to a KCL-based application, just pure Kinesis API calls. Does the using the TRIM_HORIZON shard iterator type immediately give you the earliest published record in the stream (ie earliest available within Kinesis' built-in 24hr window), or simply an iterator/cursor for some time period as much as 24 hours ago, that you must then use to advance along the stream until you hit the earliest published record? Put another way, in case that's not quite clear.... When using the shard iterator type of TRIM_HORIZON, is the expected behavior that it will begin with returning the records that were available 24 hours ago, BUT if zero records were published exactly 24 hours ago, and instead only 3 hours ago, that your application will need to iteratively poll through the previous 21 hours before it reaches the records published 3 hours ago? Timeline example: Sept 29 5:00 am - Create a stream "foo" with 1 shard Sept 29 5:02 am - Publish a single record, "Item=A", to the "foo" stream Sept 29 5:03 am - Issue a GetShardIterator call with TRIM_HORIZON as your shard iterator type, then issue a GetRecords call with that shard iterator and receive the record "Item=A" Sept 30 7:02 am - Publish a second record, "Item=B", to the "foo" stream Sept 30 7:03 am - Issue a GetShardIterator call with TRIM_HORIZON as your shard iterator type, then issue a GetRecords call with that shard iterator. What should be expected as the result from this call? (Note: we did not remember/re-use the shard iterator from step 3) For Step 5 above, it's been more than 24 hours since the "Item=A" message was published on the stream and only a minute since "Item=B" was published. Will a fresh shard iterator with TRIM_HORIZON immediately give you the earliest available record, or do you need to need to keep iterating until you hit a time period when something has been published? I'd been experimenting with Kinesis and everything was working fine yesterday or two days ago (ie. I was publishing AND consuming without any issues). I made some additional modifications to my code and began publishing again today. When I fired up my consumer, nothing was coming out at all even after letting it run for a few minutes. I tried publishing and consuming at exactly the same time, and still nothing. After manually playing with the AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER iterator type, and using some sequence numbers from my consumer logs from a few days ago, I was able to reach my recently published messages. But then if I go back to using the TRIM_HORIZON type, I see no messages at all. I've looked at the docs, but most of docs I found assume you are using the KCL (I actually was using KCL initially, but when it started failing I dropped down to raw API calls) and mention that you must have an application name and that DynamoDB tables are used for tracking state. Which as best I can tell is not true if you're using pure Kinesis API calls or the Kinesis CLI, both of which I eventually tried. I finally wrote a pure API script to start with TRIM_HORIZON and poll infinitely and eventually it hit new records (took ~600 iterations; started out 14hrs behind "now" and found records at about 5 hours behind "now"). If this is expected behavior, it seems like the wording in the docs is just a little confusing/misleading: TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system, which is the oldest data record in the shard. I assumed (now seemingly incorrectly) that the terms "oldest data record" meant record that I've published into the stream, not simply a time period in the stream. It'd be great if someone can help confirm/explain the behavior I'm seeing. Thanks!

@TITLE:Reactive Banana: how to use values from a remote API and merge them in the event stream
@CONTENT:I am using Reactive-Banana in a WX interface. I need to retrieve a value from an external service API when a button is pressed. I have a generic Behavior based on the data type AppState that ¡§accums¡¨ the transformed changes based on a function transformation (doSomeTransformation). The values that get transformed are transported by the events and they come from a remote API (getRemoteValue) when a button on the interface is pressed. I have written a slim version of the code that represents the essential part: module Main where

{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- allows "forall t. Moment t"

import Graphics.UI.WX hiding (Event)
import Reactive.Banana
import Reactive.Banana.WX

{-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------}
data AppState = AppState {
    count :: Int
} deriving (Show)

type String = [Char]

main :: IO ()
main = start $ do
    f        <- frame [text := "AppState"]
    myButton <- button f [text := "Go"]
    output   <- staticText f []

    set f [layout := margin 10 $
            column 5 [widget myButton, widget output]]

            coreOfTheApp :: Behavior t AppState
            coreOfTheApp = accumB initialState $ (doSomeTransformation to combine with myRemoteValue) <$ ebt

        sink output [text :== show <$> coreOfTheApp]

 My problem here is how to compose doSomeTransformation and myRemoteValue in a way that I can use the remote API value as normal event value. changes from banana-reactive has the following signature: changes :: Frameworks t => Behavior t a -> Moment t (Event t (Future a))
 which it will wrap my IO Int from getRemoteApiValue. So basically how can I go from: IO Int -> Moment t (Event t (Future AppState)) -> AppState
 ? BTW I am not sure if it is cleaner having this different function signature: doSomeTransformation :: Int -> AppState -> AppState, where the Int value is represented by the API returned value. It sounds like two Behaviors and one stream. Maybe a bad way to solve the problem?

@CONTENT:Is it possible to check if a variable is an optional, and what type is it wrapping? It is possible to check if a variable is an specific optional: let someString: String? = "oneString"
var anyThing: Any = someString

anyThing.dynamicType // Swift.Optional<Swift.String>
anyThing.dynamicType is Optional<String>.Type // true
anyThing.dynamicType is Optional<UIView>.Type // false
 But is it possible to check agains any type of optional? Something like: anyThing.dynamicType is Optional.Type // fails since T cant be inferred
// or 
anyThing.dynamicType is Optional<Any>.Type // false
 And once knowing you have an optional, retrieve the type it is wrapping: // hypothetical code 
anyThing.optionalType // returns String.Type
@CODE:let someString: String? = "oneString"
var anyThing: Any = someString

anyThing.dynamicType // Swift.Optional<Swift.String>
anyThing.dynamicType is Optional<String>.Type // true
anyThing.dynamicType is Optional<UIView>.Type // false anyThing.dynamicType is Optional.Type // fails since T cant be inferred

@TITLE:How to WhiteList app in Doze mode Android 6.0
@CONTENT:This question is related to the Android 6.0 Preview 3 which will be final released at the end of this month. I'm testing some stuff in Android 6.0 in the preview 3 from Google on Nexus 5 'hammerhead'. The new feature is the "doze mode" - something like deep sleep mode when the network is disabled and phone sleeps, only the SMS, calls or high priority GCM messages can wake it up. But like WhatsApp - in the doze mode it receives the messages after 2 hours or more depends on the timers. But there is a list of 'not optimised' apps called "white list" where u can manually add app. Ok, I'd like to find a way to add my application programmatically without user interaction to the "white list app list" which exists in the device in battery settings. Trying to use the reflection to get into it I found: Within the android.os.IDeviceIdleController there is a method: public abstract void addPowerSaveWhitelistApp (String packageNameOfApp) But this is an interface... So we can not make an instance of interface. There is not yet documentation about this Interface or about methods, or any inheritance tree. Maybe you have some idea where i should look for a possibility of programmatically add there my app? There is also a method public abstract boolean isPowerSaveWhitelistApp (String packageName) Which i think should be possible to access somehow?! to check if the app exist on the White List and maybe at the very end hopefully ASK user to add it to the White List. So my question is, have anyone of you tried to make something with better result ?? cuz I'm stuck and i think its a dead end. for more info: https://newcircle.com/s/post/1739/2015/06/12/diving-into-android-m-doze

class SpecialTestImpl extends TestImpl {

}
 Is this some weird Eclipse error message (it's not able to cope with Lamdas either, so maybe Mars isn't entirely Java 8 ready, yet)? I can fix it by letting SpecialTestImpl implement Test directly (which yields a warning, because it's unnecessary) or overriding the method in TestImpl (which yields a warning for the same reasons). So why wouldn't I be able to call the super method? My guess was because if I was able to call Test.super.doMagic() directly, implementing the method in TestImpl would break the API for SpecialTestImpl even though it shouldn't. But that is also true if I let SpecialTestImpl implement Test and call the default method that way.
@CODE:interface Test {

    default void doMagic() {
        System.out.println("Abracadabra");

@TITLE:HTML5/CSS align list-items depending on other columns mutual height
@CONTENT:I got the following use case: You can see three identical boxes: Each box beginns with a big rectangle box, that has a picture and variable content and thus has variable height. the rest consists of a list, that is vertical aligned bottom, so that they should get the same height. My goal is to "synchronize" the height of the < li >'s in each of these boxes. So it should not be important how many text you enter in such a < li > tag, the design should automatically handle the word-break and align the content like it was a row. In other words, like Abhitalks stated, I want to align list-items to their peers in other content columns depending on the mutual heights. Now, I used display flex in order to vertical align the list to bottom of the element. You can find my used solution here: Vertical alignment of floating divs But now I got the problem, that if the list has no identical content (e.x. more than two rows per listitem, the whole thing shifts to the top. However, is it somehow possible to simulate a row behavior with flexbox, but actually having a column structure? I need a column structure, so I can easily get a responsive layout. hope you understand my problem thanks in advance! UPDATE: Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/a1yr4u84/3/ You can see, that I made < br / >'s inside the li's content, in order to make the content fit. <li>one <br /> two</li>
<li>one <br /> two <br /> three</li>
<li>one<br /><br /></li>
 However, I can't control how many text there is going to be in the li's. And I don't want the user to hack with < br / >s but let the design handle the content, so I want the list inside the columns to behave like a row

@LINK:/questions/32582000/angularjs-unit-testing-various-patterns-for-injecting-dependencies
@TITLE:AngularJS Unit Testing - Various patterns for injecting dependencies
@CONTENT:I'm new to unit testing and am mainly learning from examples that I find. The problem is that I've seen so many different patterns that it's hard to understand what the differences are between them. And how to combine those patterns for various use cases. Below is one such pattern:     var $rootScope, $window, $location;
    beforeEach(angular.mock.module('security.service', 'security/loginModal.tpl.html'));

    beforeEach(inject(function(_$rootScope_, _$location_) {
        $rootScope = _$rootScope_;
        $location = _$location_;
    }));

    var service, queue;
    beforeEach(inject(function($injector) {
        service = $injector.get('security');
        queue = $injector.get('securityRetryQueue');
    }));
 So from this pattern, I've gleaned that Angular core services/providers should be injected with the underscore pattern where as other 3rd party dependencies or my own dependencies should be done using the $injector.get() pattern. Is this valid? I've noticed I can do $injector.get() with Angular core services and it will still work so maybe it's just convention to do it this way? Also, what is the point of 'security/loginModal.tpl.html' in beforeEach(angular.mock.module('security.service', 'security/loginModal.tpl.html'));? I know that it is an HTML template added to the template cache but what is angular.mock.module doing with it? I've also seen this less common pattern that throws a monkey wrench in the above logic:     beforeEach(inject(function($injector, _$location_) {
        security = $injector.get('security');
        $location = _$location_;
    }));
 If I can just add services to the inject callback like this code does with $location, that seems like a simpler way of referencing dependencies. Why should I not do this? Here's another pattern:     beforeEach(function() {
        module('security.service', function($provide) {
            $provide.value('$window', $window = jasmine.createSpyObj('$window', ['addEventListener', 'postMessage', 'open']));
        });

        inject(function(security) {
            service = security;
        });
    });
 From my understanding, the point of this pattern is to initialize "security.service" module with a mocked $window. This makes sense, but how do I fit this pattern in with the previous patterns? i.e. how do I mock 'security/loginModal.tpl.html', how do I inject my Angular core dependencies + my other dependencies? Lastly, what can I and can't inject in nested describe and it blocks? Is it safe to assume I can't retro-inject mocked services to the module I'm testing. So then what can I inject and what are the use cases? If there is a definitive documentation source for AngularJS unit testing initialization that would help answer these questions, please point me to it.
@CODE:var $rootScope, $window, $location;
    beforeEach(angular.mock.module('security.service', 'security/loginModal.tpl.html'));

    beforeEach(inject(function(_$rootScope_, _$location_) {
        $rootScope = _$rootScope_;
        $location = _$location_;
    }));

    var service, queue;
    beforeEach(inject(function($injector) {
        service = $injector.get('security');
        queue = $injector.get('securityRetryQueue');
    })); beforeEach(angular.mock.module('security.service', 'security/loginModal.tpl.html')); beforeEach(inject(function($injector, _$location_) {
        security = $injector.get('security');
        $location = _$location_;
    })); beforeEach(function() {
        module('security.service', function($provide) {
            $provide.value('$window', $window = jasmine.createSpyObj('$window', ['addEventListener', 'postMessage', 'open']));
        });

        inject(function(security) {
            service = security;
        });
    });

I see that the built in tag helpers for existing HTML elements are all prefixed with "asp-" For example: <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a> But what about my own custom tag helpers. Should I also prefix those with "asp-" to show that it is running on the server. Or should this be reserved for framework attributes? Should I create my own project/company named prefix instead? Is there any guidance on this subject that I have missed?
@CODE:<a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>

@TITLE:How to get a settings storage path in a cross-platform way in Qt?
@CONTENT:My program needs to read/write a text (just a few lines) file with its settings to disk. To specify a path in code may work well on one platform, like windows, but if runs it on Linux, the path is not cross platform. I am looking for a similar solution to QSettings that saves settings to different paths or has its native ways to handle this. Programmers don't need to do with the details. But the text file is not suitable to be saved as a value in QSettings. No user interaction should be needed to obtain such path. The text file should persist across application restarts. It can't be a temporary file. Is there an existing solution in Qt and what is the API that should be used?

@LINK:/questions/32413634/is-it-safe-to-use-static-methods-on-file-class-in-c
@TITLE:Is it safe to use static methods on File class in C#?
@CONTENT:I have following code in code-behind of an ASP.Net app, where a file is being read followed by writing to the file. Code var state= File.ReadAllText(Server.MapPath(string.Format("~/state/{0}", fileName)));
if(state.indexOf("1") == 0) 
{
  File.WriteAllText(Server.MapPath(string.Format("~/state/{0}", fileName)), newState);
}
 Sometimes, but not always, I get the following exception. Exception The process cannot access the file 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\mywebsite1\state\20150905005929435_edf9267e-fad1-45a7-bfe2-0e6e643798b5' because it is being used by another process. I am guessing that the file read operation sometimes is not closing the file before the write operation happens, Or may be the file write operation is not closing the file before the next request from web application comes. But, I cannot find what exactly is the reason. Question: How can I avoid this error from happening? Is it not safe to use the File class and instead use the traditional approach of FileStream object where I would always dispose the FileStream object explicitly? UPDATE 1 I tried a retry loop approach, but even that didn't seem to solve the problem , since I was able to reproduce the same error if the ASP.Net page was submitted very quickly multiple times one after another. So I am back to finding a fool-proof solution in my case.   string state = null;
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 20) {
    try {

        state = File.ReadAllText(Server.MapPath(string.Format("~/state/{0}", fileName)));

    } catch (Exception ex2) {
        //log exception
        Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex2);
        //if even retry doesn't work then throw an exception
        if (i == 19) {
            throw;
        }
        //sleep for a few milliseconds
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);
    }
    i++;
  }

  i = 0;
  while (i < 20) {
    try {


        File.WriteAllText(Server.MapPath(string.Format("~/state/{0}", fileName)), newState);

    } catch (Exception ex2) {
        //log exception
        Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex2);
        //if even retry doesn't work then throw an exception
        if (i == 19) {
            throw;
        }
        //sleep for a few milliseconds
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);
    }
    i++;
  }
 UPDATE 2 The only fool proof solution that seemed to work is by using a File Sequencing approach, as suggested by usr. This involves writing to a different file and not to the same file that was just read. The name of file being written to is the name of file that was just read appended by a sequence number.   string fileName = hiddenField1.Value;
  string state = null;
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 20) {
    try {

        state = File.ReadAllText(Server.MapPath(string.Format("~/state/{0}", fileName)));

    } catch (Exception ex2) {
        //log exception
        Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex2);
        //if even retry doesn't work then throw an exception
        if (i == 19) {
            throw;
        }
        //sleep for a few milliseconds
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);
    }
    i++;
  }

  i = 0;
  while (i < 20) {
    try {
        //***************FILE SEQUENCING**************************
        //Change the file to which state is written, so no concurrency errors happen 
        //between reading from and writing to same file. This is a fool-proof solution.
        //Since max value of integer is more than 2 billion i.e. 2,147,483,647
        //so we can be sure that our sequence will never run out of limits because an ASP.Net page
        //is not going to postback 2 billion times
        if (fileName.LastIndexOf("-seq_") >= 0) {
            fileName = fileName.Substring(0, fileName.LastIndexOf("-seq_") + 4 + 1) + (int.Parse(fileName.Substring(fileName.LastIndexOf("-seq_") + 4 + 1)) + 1);
        } else {
            fileName = fileName + "-seq_1";
        }
        //change the file name so in next read operation the new file is read
        hiddenField1.Value = fileName;
        File.WriteAllText(Server.MapPath(string.Format("~/state/{0}", fileName)), newState);

    } catch (Exception ex2) {
        //log exception
        Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex2);
        //if even retry doesn't work then throw an exception
        if (i == 19) {
            throw;
        }
        //sleep for a few milliseconds
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);
    }
    i++;
  }
 The only downside to above approach is that many files would get created as end users post back to the same ASP.Net page. So, it would be good to have a background job that deleted stale files so number of files would be minimized. File Names with sequencing UPDATE 3 Another fool proof solution is to alternate between read and write file names. This way we do not end up creating many files and only use 2 files as the end user posts back to the same page many times. The code is same as in code under UPDATE 2 except the code after FILE SEQUENCING comment should be replaced by code below. if (fileName.LastIndexOf("-seq_1") >= 0) {
            fileName = fileName.Substring(0, fileName.LastIndexOf("-seq_1"));
        } else {
            fileName = fileName + "-seq_1";
        }

@TITLE:C# app hangs randomly when called from Process.Start()
@CONTENT:I have a Windows service set up to manage custom .Net tasks. Organization is: -Windows Service monitors a schedule and starts a worker .exe as needed. -Worker .exe (lightweight winform app) uses a command line argument to pull up a DLL (plugin) and run some code. This has been working well for months. I recently migrated it to Server 2012 (from 2008 IIRC) - this may be unrelated but it's hard to tell. Since some time after the migration, I've encountered an issue where the worker .exe "starts" after being called by a process.start(), but doesn't reach my code. No errors or anything, it just seems to freeze during app load. The service code that starts it is fairly standard. // Create a temp folder and copy the executable to it
// (so the source exe isn't always in use and can be swapped out)

Process p = new Process();
ProcessStartInfo psi = new ProcessStartInfo();
psi.FileName = Path.Combine(temp.Path, Path.GetFileName(ExecutablePath));
psi.Arguments = CommandLineArgs.ConcatenateList(" ");
psi.UseShellExecute = false;
psi.RedirectStandardError = true;
psi.RedirectStandardInput = true;
psi.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
psi.CreateNoWindow = true;
psi.ErrorDialog = false;
psi.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden;
p.StartInfo = psi;
p.Start();

// read standard output if necessary, kill and reschedule if appears to be frozen, etc.
 At that point, the worker executable starts up - it appears mostly normal in the task manager. The only thing that tips me off that something's gone wrong is the memory consumption - under normal circumstances the worker hits around 5MB during launch and grows to reflect the task, but when the process freezes it only reaches around 2MB and stops. As proof that it's not any of my code in the worker, I've added a call to a logging function as the very first line and never seen a log. There are no error messages, and - the really strange bit - it isn't a consistent issue. The exact same call that freezes now will run fine 30 seconds later. There also doesn't appear to be any true pattern to when the issue occurs either - the closest thing I'm seeing is that it occasionally happens to multiple tasks at once (e.g. it might be affecting all tasks started at the time when the issue occurs with any task). I have it at a point where the service can automatically detect it and handle it appropriately, so it's not an urgent issue, but still something I'd like to fix if a cause or solution stands out to anyone. Init code of worker is just a standard win forms startup, with my stuff starting to get called in form_load. static class Program
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The main entry point for the application.
    /// </summary>
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new Form1());
    }
}

public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
}

private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Do Stuff - never gets hit when the freeze happens.
}
 Edit: Per comments, set up the service to log a minidump with the log entry it creates when it sees a hung process. Will check on it tomorrow and see what comes of it. Edit Sept 4, 2015: Minidump info: The minidump shows the code stopped/stuck at the exiting } of static void main, i.e.: static void Main()
{
    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
    Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
    Application.Run(new Form1());
} // <------ This is where the main thread is frozen.
 Everything seems fine otherwise. I'm going to do some research and try some changes to the worker just in case. Edit Sept 4 2015 #2: Adjusted the worker startup and it seems to be working. The gist of it is removing the Form reference and just using application context (e.g. codeproject sample) I pounded the system with task requests and it didn't have any issues. I'll let it run over the weekend as a test and do a status update on Tuesday. Still curious about why it would randomly break like that with the form load. Code as it stands now: static class Program

@LINK:/questions/32381773/arrays-in-different-languages-store-references-or-raw-objects
@TITLE:Arrays in different languages - store references, or raw objects?
@CONTENT:I am trying to wrap my head around what the raw memory looks like in different languages when using an array. Consider the following Java code: String a = "hi";
String b = "there";
String c = "everyone";
String[] array = {a, b, c};
 Obviously the array is holding references, and not objects; that is, there is a contiguous array in memory of three references which each points to some other location in memory where the object sits. So the objects themselves aren't necessarily sitting in three contiguous buckets; rather the references are. Now consider this: String[] array = {"hi", "there", "everyone"}
 I'd imagine in this situation the Strings exist somewhere with all the other constants in memory, and then the array holds references to those constants in memory? So, again, in raw memory the array doesn't look like ['h', 'i', '\0', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e'... (etc)]. (using c-style termination just for convenience). Rather, it's more like ['a83a3edf' ,'a38decd' ... (etc)] where each element is a memory location (reference). My conclusion from this thought process is that in Java, you can never ever imagine arrays as buckets of contiguous objects in memory, but rather as contiguous references. I can't think of any way to guarantee objects will always be stored contiguously in Java. Now consider C: char *a = "hi";
char *b = "there";
char *c = "everyone";
char *array[] = {a, b, c};
 The code above is functionally equivalent to the Java above -- that is, the array holds references (pointers) to some other memory location. Like Java, the objects being pointed to aren't necessarily contiguous. HOWEVER, in the following C code: struct my_struct array[5];  // allocates 5 * size(my_struct) in memory! NOT room for 5
                            // references/pointers, but room for 5 my_structs.
 The structs in array ARE contiguously located in raw memory. Now for my concrete questions: Was I correct in my assumption that in Java, arrays must ALWAYS hold references, as the programmer only ever has access to references in Java? What about for raw data types? Will it work differently then? Will an array of ints in Java look just like one in C in raw memory (besides the Object class cruft Java will add)? In Java, is there no way for the programmer to guarantee contiguous memory allocation of objects? It might happen by chance, or with high probability, but the programmer can not GUARANTEE it will be so? In C, programmers CAN create raw arrays of objects (structs) contiguously in memory, as I have shown above, correct? How do other languages deal with this? I'm guessing Python works like Java? The motivation for this question is that I want a solid understanding of what is happening at he raw memory level with arrays in these languages. Mostly for programmer-interview questions. I said in a previous interview that an array (not in any language, just in general) holds objects contiguously in memory like buckets. It was only after I said this that I realized that's not quite how it works in a language like Java. So I want to be 100% clear on it. Thanks. Let me know if anything needs clarification.
@CODE:String a = "hi";
String b = "there";
String c = "everyone";
String[] array = {a, b, c}; String[] array = {"hi", "there", "everyone"} ['h', 'i', '\0', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e'... (etc)] ['a83a3edf' ,'a38decd' ... (etc)] char *a = "hi";
char *b = "there";

@TITLE:Paper_trail gem abilities
@CONTENT:I was wondering whether the following use case can be achieved using the papertrail gem? A Wikipedia-type of application with wiki pages that logged in users can change/edit and where: Moderators can undo specific changes: I understand papertrail allows to roll back to a previous version but what I¡¦m asking here is somewhat different. That is, the ability to undo a specific edit/change. Suppose there have been three edits/versions to a record/wiki-page. Then if you want to undo edit 2, then changes from edit 1 and 3 should still remain. But if you would roll back to the version before edit 2, then also edit 3 would be undone, which is not what I want here. Changes made (contributions) by a user feed back into the user¡¦s profile, which would then have an overview of the changes/contributions made by that user: I believe this is possible using the --with-changes option (which registers the change that was made in addition to the full dump of the changed resource) in combination with the fact that papertrail registers the user who has made a change. Am I correct in my understanding? In the tutorial http://samurails.com/gems/papertrail/ I read about using papertrail in combination with the gem diffy to establish what was changed exactly, but what I don¡¦t understand is why the tutorial uses diffy when papertrail itself already offers a ¡§diffing¡¨ functionality? To have moderators first accept a change by some users, before that change is actually implemented (i.e., before the change is actually applied): Can papertrail also help to achieve this functionality?

@CONTENT:I have problem with the way Safari handles CORS requests. Consider following scenario: DomainA hosts a page which makes a XHR request to DomainB (origin header is set to DomainA) DomainB returns 302 redirect do DomainC (origin header is set to null, which seems to be OK with RFC) DomainC return 200 response with actual content This works in Chrome, FF, but it fails on Safari (tested on Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/600.8.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.8 Safari/600.8.9). When I make the request without xhr.withCredentials turned on, first, Safari makes a OPTIONS preflight request prior actual request to DomainC, which IMHO is not nessesary as all request are simple request, but that I can handle. Problem is Safari fails after preflight request to DomainC saying "Cannot make any request from null". I can bypass this by setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin to * and drop Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header (those are mutually exclusive), which would make this scenario work. However I still think this is not correct behavior. Now, thing is I need credentials to be passed by (and no, I can not pass it some other way as it depends on some third party servers). So, let's set xhr.withCredentials to true and we are back to "Cannot make any request from null" and now even wildcarding Access-Control-Allow-Credentials does not help. I think all CORS headers are set properly, but please feel free to check me. Test example can be found here: http://a.ihatesafari.com What is going on here? Is it a bug or am I missing something?

@TITLE:How do I push a view controller onto the nav stack from search results when presenting them modally?
@CONTENT:I want to recreate the search UI shown in the iOS 7/8 calendar app. Presenting the search UI modally isn't a problem. I use UISearchController and modally present it just like the UICatalog sample code shows which gives me a nice drop down animation. The issue comes when trying to push a view controller from the results view controller. It isn't wrapped in a navigation controller so I can't push onto it. If I do wrap it in a navigation controller then I don't get the default drop down animation when I present the UISearchController. Any ideas? EDIT: I got it to push by wrapping my results view controller in a nav controller. However the search bar is still present after pushing the new VC onto the stack. EDIT (2): DTS from Apple said that the calendar app uses a non-standard method to push from search results. Instead they recommend removing focus from the search controller then pushing and returning focus on pop. This is similar to the way search in the settings app works I imagine.

@TITLE:low RAM consuming c++ eigen solver
@CONTENT:I'm newbie in C++ programming, but I have a task to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors (standard eigenproblem Ax=lx) for symmetric matrices (and hermitian)) for very large matrix of size: binomial(L,L/2) where L is about 18-22. Now I'm testing it on machine which has about 7.7 GB ram available, but at final I'll have access to PC with 64GB RAM. I've started with Lapack++. At the beginning my project assume to solve this problem only for symmetrical real matrices. This library was great. Very quick and small RAM consuming. It has an option to compute eigenvectors and place into input matrix A to save memory. It works! I thought that Lapack++ eigensolver can handle with Hermitian matrix, but it can't for unknown reason (maybe I'm doing something wrong). My project has evolved and I should be able to calculate also this problem for Hermitian matrices. So I've tried to change library to Armadillo library. It works fine, but it isn't that nice as Lapack++ which replaces mat A with all eigenvec, but of course supports hermitian matrices. Some statistic for L=14 Lapack++ RAM 126MB time 7.9s eigenval + eigenvectors Armadillo RAM 216MB time 12s eigenval Armadillo RAM 396MB time 15s eigenval+eigenvectors Let's do some calculation: double variable is about 8B. My matrix has size binomial(14,7) = 3432, so in the ideal case it should have 3432^2*8/1024^2 = 89 MB. My question is: is it posible to modify or inforce Armadillo to do a nice trick as Lapack++? Armadillo uses LAPACK and BLAS routines. Or maybe someone can recomemnd another approach to this problem using another library? P.S.: My matrix is really sparse. It has about 2 * binomial(L,L/2) non-zero elements. I've tried to compute this with SuperLU in CSC format but It wasn't very effective, for L=14 -> RAM 185MB, but time 135s.

@TITLE:UITableView Drag & Drop Outside Table = Crash
@CONTENT:The Good My drag & drop function almost works wonderfully. I longPress a cell and it smoothly allows me to move the pressed cell to a new location between two other cells. The table adjusts and the changes save to core data. Great! The Bad My problem is that if I drag the cell below the bottom cell in the table, even if I don't let go (un-press) of the cell... the app crashes. If I do the drag slowly, really it crashes as the cell crosses the y-center of the last cell... so I do think it's a problem related to the snapshot getting a location. Less important, but possibly related, is that if I long press below the last cell with a value in it, it also crashes. The drag/drop runs off a switch statement that runs one of three sets of code based on the status: One case when the press begins One case when the cell is being dragged One case when when the user lets go of the cell My code is adapted from this tutorial: Drag & Drop Tutorial My code:  func longPressGestureRecognized(gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) {

 Potential Culprit My guess is that the issue is related to the cell being unable to get coordinates once it is below the last cell. It isn't really floating, it is constantly setting its location in relation to the other cells. I think the solution will be an if-statement that does something magical when there's no cell to reference for a location. But what!?! Adding a nil check to each case isn't working for some reason. Clearly Stated Question How do I avoid crashes and handle an event where my dragged cell is dragged below the last cell? Screenshot of crash:

 Imagine these are the first four games of a season with 1230 games. I want to calculate the cumulative points per game (mean) at any given time for the home team and the visiting team. The output would look like this:   TeamHome TeamAway PTS_TeamHome PTS_TeamAway HOMETEAM_AVGCUMPTS ROADTEAM_AVGCUMPTS
1  LAL      IND          101           95                101                 95

 Note that what the formula does for the fifth game for the home team. Since the LAL is the home team it looks for how many points has LAL scored when playing at home or on the road. In this case (101 + 89 + 105 + 95) / 4 = 97.5 Here is what I tried without much success: lst <- list()
for(i in 1:nrow(df)) lst[[i]] <- ( cumsum(df[which(df$TEAM1[1:i]==df$TEAM1[i]),df$PTS_TeamAway,0])

                             / #divided by number of games
  df$HOMETEAM_AVGCUMPTS <- unlist(lst)
 I wanted to calculate the cumulative PTS and then the number of games to divide it by but none of this worked.

Abort trap: 6
 It seems SignalHandler.SIG_DFL is not meant to be called directly (even from other signal handling code). So how can I manually trigger it? Alternatively, how can I manually replicate the behavior of SIG_DFL? It appears to be equivalent to: System.exit(signal.getNumber() + 128)
 but I don't see any documentation to that effect. Another way to phrase my question: In practice* is there a difference between these two code blocks? A) Signal.handle(new Signal("INT"), SignalHandler.SIG_DFL);
 B) Signal.handle(new Signal("INT"), new SignalHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(Signal signal) {
    System.exit(signal.getNumber() + 128)
  }});
 *I know undocumented behavior could change at any time, but it's unlikely that the JVM's exit behavior will change mid-version. An answer that simply details what happens now is acceptable, in practice.

@TITLE:javafx: Multiple events in a setRowFactory and combining anonymous inner class and lambda expressions
@CONTENT:I have 2 sets of events that change the appearance of the table row. table flashing when some conditions flash table highlighting when a new item is added Suppose my TableView is called table, my code structure is like this: TableView<Trade> table = ... ;

        {

            ChangeListener<Boolean> cautionListener = (obs, cautionWasSet, cautionIsNowSet) -> {
                if (cautionIsNowSet) {
                    flasher.play();

@TITLE:How to close window OSX?
@CONTENT:I wanted to create an application that mainly only involves the status bar. So far I have created the status bar item using NSMenu and NSStatusBar and I have also removed the dock icon with this bit of code on load: [NSApp setActivationPolicy: NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory];
 But what I still have is the NSWindow appearing when opening the app. How can I prevent this? I also would like to be able to re-open it. I have come up with a horrible way to close it: [_mainView setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 0, 0)];
 Where _mainView is the main NSView in my viewcontroller that is conected to the nswindow. I then want to be able to open the window again but with this time a table. But I get the error: <Warning>: void CGSUpdateManager::log() const: conn 0x18de3 token 0x31fffffffffdafd
 When resetting the frame back to the original size. Also if I close the NSView that then means I can't re-open the view again. This is a long winded explanation of an application that can control whether the window the viewcontroller is in, is opened or close.
@CODE:NSMenu NSStatusBar [NSApp setActivationPolicy: NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory]; NSWindow [_mainView setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 0, 0)]; _mainView NSView nswindow <Warning>: void CGSUpdateManager::log() const: conn 0x18de3 token 0x31fffffffffdafd rootViewController appDelegate [_window orderOut:self]; [_window makeKeyAndOrderFront:self];

@TITLE:Difference between traditional imperative style of programming and functional style of programming
@CONTENT:I have a problem statement here what I need to do it iterate over a list find the first integer which is greater than 3 and is even then just double it and return it. These are some methods to check how many operations are getting performed public static boolean isGreaterThan3(int number){
        System.out.println("WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 " + number);
        return number > 3;
    }
    public static boolean isEven(int number){
        System.out.println("WhyFunctional.isEven " + number);
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
    public static int doubleIt(int number){
        System.out.println("WhyFunctional.doubleIt " + number);
        return number << 1;
    }
 with java 8 streams I could do it like List<Integer> integerList = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
integerList.stream()
           .filter(WhyFunctional::isGreaterThan3)
           .filter(WhyFunctional::isEven)
           .map(WhyFunctional::doubleIt)
           .findFirst();
 and the output is WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 1
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 2
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 3
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 5
WhyFunctional.isEven 5
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 4
WhyFunctional.isEven 4
WhyFunctional.doubleIt 4
Optional[8]
 so total 8 operations. And with imperative style or before java8 I could code it like for (Integer integer : integerList) {
            if(isGreaterThan3(integer)){
                if(isEven(integer)){
                    System.out.println(doubleIt(integer));
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
 and the output is WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 1
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 2
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 3
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 5
WhyFunctional.isEven 5
WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 4
WhyFunctional.isEven 4
WhyFunctional.doubleIt 4
8
 and operations are same. So my question is what difference does it make if I am using streams rather traditional for loop.
@CODE:public static boolean isGreaterThan3(int number){
        System.out.println("WhyFunctional.isGreaterThan3 " + number);
        return number > 3;
    }
    public static boolean isEven(int number){
        System.out.println("WhyFunctional.isEven " + number);
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
    public static int doubleIt(int number){
        System.out.println("WhyFunctional.doubleIt " + number);
        return number << 1;
    } List<Integer> integerList = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
integerList.stream()

@TITLE:Best approach to change background image in AngularJs at runtime
@CONTENT:I want to create generic feature that allows me to change background image of any section. After going through options provided I found these two approaches. Want to choose best approach to change image because on single page I want multiple times change background facility. It will be available to four to five sections. Approach Using Directive check this stack overflow link. Also there is another approach of angular scope variables that we can updates at runtime. <div ng-style="{'background-image': 'url(/images/' + backgroundImageUrl + ')'}"></div>
 Required Usage ( With respect of Directive ) <body>
    <section backgroundImage url="{{backgroundImageUrl1}}">
        ...
    </section>
    <section backgroundImage url="{{backgroundImageUrl2}}">
        ...
    </section>
    <section backgroundImage url="{{backgroundImageUrl3}}">
        ...
    </section>
    <section backgroundImage url="{{backgroundImageUrl4}}">
        ...
    </section>
</body>
 As shown above I am going to update background-image attribute for each section. If these property is set inside CSS file, it will reduce time to load images i.e. If we directly add inline css styling in HTML, all images will loaded on DOM load. It will make extra request to server to get images and load them in DOM. I wanted to follow strategy that will reduce loading time in my SPA(Single Page Application).
@CODE:<div ng-style="{'background-image': 'url(/images/' + backgroundImageUrl + ')'}"></div> <body>

@TITLE:Efficiently read data from a structured file in C/C++
@CONTENT:I have a file as follows: The file consists of 2 parts: header and data. The data part is separated into equally sized pages. Each page holds data for a specific metric. Multiple pages (needs not to be consecutive) might be needed to hold data for a single metric. Each page consists of a page header and a page body. A page header has a field called "Next page" that is the index of the next page that holds data for the same metric. A page body holds real data. All pages have the same & fixed size (20 bytes for header and 800 bytes for body (if data amount is less than 800 bytes, 0 will be filled)). The header part consists of 20,000 elements, each element has information about a specific metric (point 1 -> point 20000). An element has a field called "first page" that is actually index of the first page holding data for the metric. The file can be up to 10 GB. Requirement: Re-order data of the file in the shortest time, that is, pages holding data for a single metric must be consecutive, and from metric 1 to metric 20000 according to alphabet order (header part must be updated accordingly). An apparent approach: For each metric, read all data for the metric (page by page), write data to new file. But this takes much time, especially when reading data from the file. Is there any efficient ways?

@TITLE:Why implicit conversion of bool to string isn't an error?
@CONTENT:I goggled it & tried to find similar question on SO also but didn't find anything useful. So, posting my question here. Consider this program: #include <iostream>
void foo(const std::string &) {}
int main() 
{
    foo(false);
}
[Warning] converting 'false' to pointer type for argument 1 of 'std::basic_string<_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc>::basic_string(const _CharT*, const _Alloc&) [with _CharT = char; _Traits = std::char_traits<char>; _Alloc = std::allocator<char>]' [-Wconversion-null]
 Why C++ allows this without explicit cast? I was expecting to get compiler error. The program abnormally terminates at runtime due to exception displaying following: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  basic_string::_S_construct null not valid

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.
 What the standard says about this type of implicit conversion?

    } else {

    }
}
 in the code above, 'navigationInstruction' is undefined. Therefore, my solution cannot work well. Does anybody have another solution? Thanks so much!

@CONTENT:Disclaimer: I might have misunderstood how arrays are created, allocated and initialised. If so, please try to read between the lines. If I create an array by doing int array[15] = {0};
 All elements of array the compiler will initialise the elements to 0. How is this done by the compiler? Does the compiler insert a loop that iterates the allocated memory and sets each element to zero? Does size impact performance? I.e. does it takes longer time to initialise an array of double size (30)? How much longer? Double? Logarithmic? Power of 2? Only asking out of curiosity.

@TITLE:How to add a condition that a parsed number must satisfy in FParsec?
@CONTENT:I am trying to parse an int32 with FParsec but have an additional restriction that the number must be less than some maximum value. Is their a way to perform this without writing my own custom parser (as below) and/or is my custom parser (below) the appropriate way of achieving the requirements. I ask because most of the built-in library functions seem to revolve around a char satisfying certain predicates and not any other type. let pRow: Parser<int> = 
   let error = messageError ("int parsed larger than maxRows")
   let mutable res = Reply(Error, error)
   fun stream ->
      let reply = pint32 stream
      if reply.Status = Ok && reply.Result <= 1000000 then
         res <- reply
      res
 UPDATE Below is an attempt at a more fitting FParsec solution based on the direction given in the comment below: let pRow2: Parser<int> = 
   pint32 >>= (fun x -> if x <= 1048576 then (preturn x) else fail "int parsed larger than maxRows")
 Is this the correct way to do it?

@TITLE:Identifying a subclass with Swift Generics works with custom class but not with UITapGestureRecognizer
@CONTENT:There's something I wanted to do in swift, but I couldn't figure out how to achieve it, that is to remove gesture recognisers given a Class Type, here's my code (and example), i'm using swift 2.0 in Xcode 7 beta 5: I have 3 classes that inherits from UITapGestureRecognizer class GestureONE: UIGestureRecognizer { /*...*/ }
class GestureTWO: UIGestureRecognizer { /*...*/ }
class GestureTHREE: UIGestureRecognizer { /*...*/ }
 Add them to a view var gesture1 =     GestureONE()
var gesture11 =    GestureONE()
var gesture2 =     GestureTWO()
var gesture22 =    GestureTWO()
var gesture222 =   GestureTWO()
var gesture3 =     GestureTHREE()

var myView = UIView()
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture1)
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture11)
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture2)
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture22)
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture222)
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture3)
 I print the object: print(myView.gestureRecognizers!)
// playground prints "[<__lldb_expr_224.TapONE: 0x7fab52c20b40; baseClass = UITapGestureRecognizer; state = Possible; view = <UIView 0x7fab52d259c0>>, <__lldb_expr_224.TapONE: 0x7fab52d21250; baseClass = UITapGestureRecognizer; state = Possible; view = <UIView 0x7fab52d259c0>>, <__lldb_expr_224.TapTWO: 0x7fab52d24a60; baseClass = UITapGestureRecognizer; state = Possible; view = <UIView 0x7fab52d259c0>>, <__lldb_expr_224.TapTWO: 0x7fab52c21130; baseClass = UITapGestureRecognizer; state = Possible; view = <UIView 0x7fab52d259c0>>, <__lldb_expr_224.TapTWO: 0x7fab52e13260; baseClass = UITapGestureRecognizer; state = Possible; view = <UIView 0x7fab52d259c0>>, <__lldb_expr_224.TapTHREE: 0x7fab52c21410; baseClass = UITapGestureRecognizer; state = Possible; view = <UIView 0x7fab52d259c0>>]"
 Have this extension I made with a generic function extension UIView {
    func removeGestureRecognizers<T: UIGestureRecognizer>(type: T.Type) {
        if let gestures = self.gestureRecognizers {
            for gesture in gestures {
                if gesture is T {
                    removeGestureRecognizer(gesture)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 Then I use it myView.gestureRecognizers?.count // Prints 6
myView.removeGestureRecognizers(GestureTWO)
myView.gestureRecognizers?.count // Prints 0
 Is removing all of the gestures D: And here's an experiment with custom classes //** TEST WITH ANIMALS*//
class Animal { /*...*/ }

class Dog: Animal { /*...*/ }
class Cat: Animal { /*...*/ }
class Hipo: Animal { /*...*/ }

class Zoo {
    var animals = [Animal]()
}

var zoo = Zoo()

var dog1 = Dog()
var cat1 = Cat()
var cat2 = Cat()
var cat3 = Cat()
var hipo1 = Hipo()
var hipo2 = Hipo()

zoo.animals.append(dog1)
zoo.animals.append(cat1)
zoo.animals.append(cat2)
zoo.animals.append(cat3)
zoo.animals.append(hipo1)
zoo.animals.append(hipo2)

print(zoo.animals)
//playground prints "[Dog, Cat, Cat, Cat, Hipo, Hipo]"

extension Zoo {
    func removeAnimalType<T: Animal>(type: T.Type) {
        for (index, animal) in animals.enumerate() {
            if animal is T {
                animals.removeAtIndex(index)
            }
        }
    }
}

zoo.animals.count // prints 6
zoo.removeAnimalType(Cat)
zoo.animals.count // prints 3
 It's actually removing the classes it should :D What am I missing with the UIGestureRecognizer's? I ended up with a workaround making a function that has no generics (boring) like this: extension UIView {
    func removeActionsTapGestureRecognizer() {
        if let gestures = self.gestureRecognizers {
            gestures.map({
                if $0 is ActionsTapGestureRecognizer {
                    self.removeGestureRecognizer($0)
                }
            })
        }
    }
}
 This works of course, but still I would like to have a real solution I appreciate your help!! Note: First question I ask here
@CODE:class GestureONE: UIGestureRecognizer { /*...*/ }
class GestureTWO: UIGestureRecognizer { /*...*/ }
class GestureTHREE: UIGestureRecognizer { /*...*/ } var gesture1 =     GestureONE()

var gesture2 =     GestureTWO()
var gesture22 =    GestureTWO()
var gesture222 =   GestureTWO()
var gesture3 =     GestureTHREE()

var myView = UIView()
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture1)
myView.addGestureRecognizer(gesture11)

@TITLE:cakephp multiple apps with same cake library and shared session
@CONTENT:I was having cakephp running application as public website of our company, boss asked me to create another application for them to manage in-office activities using the same user-accounts and their privileges. On local development PC that project is located at D:/wamp/www/blackstone I just copied D:/wamp/www/blackstone/app and pasted it at same location naming it office. The app folder paths are: D:/wamp/www/blackstone/app
D:/wamp/www/blackstone/office
 I have committed 'isAutorized', 'Auth' & 'Session' component in 'office' appController to prevent checking for login. Apps are being accessed using the following URLs: localhost/blackstone
localhost/blackstone/office
 I want to access 'Session' of blackstone in office. I have yet to find a solution. Currently I have core.php in blackstone as: Configure::write('Session', array(
        'defaults' => 'cake',
        'cookie' => 'my_app',
        'timeout'  => 500,  // 8 hours + 20 min, 
        'cookie_path' => '/',
        )
    );
 core.php in office app as: Configure::write('Session', array(
        'defaults' => 'cake',
        'cookie' => 'my_app',
        'timeout'  => 500,  // 8 hours + 20 min, 
        'cookie_path' => '../',
        )
    );
 and this led to a lot more changes. What can I try and change?

@TITLE:Why are you unable convert Slice types?
@CONTENT:I was wondering why you can't do: type Foo struct { A int }
type Bar Foo

foos := []Foo{Foo{1}, Foo{2}}
bars := []Bar(foos)
//cannot convert foos (type []Foo) to type []Bar
 and I found out that this would require the runtime to perform a loop over the slice to convert each of the elements, which would be non-idiomatic Go. This makes sense. However, could this not be solved by the compiler just aliasing Bar as Foo, so internally they're the same and they use the same type header underneath? I'm guessing the answer is no though I'm curious as to why.
@CODE:type Foo struct { A int }
type Bar Foo

foos := []Foo{Foo{1}, Foo{2}}
bars := []Bar(foos)
//cannot convert foos (type []Foo) to type []Bar Bar Foo unsafe

@TITLE:Code design: performance vs maintainability
@CONTENT:Contextualisation Im am implementing a bytecode instrumenter using the soot framework in a testing context and I want to know which design is better. I am building the TraceMethod object for every Method in a Class that I am instrumenting and I want to run this instrumenter on multiple Classes. Which Option offers more performance(Space¡Vtime)? Option 1: (Maps) public class TraceMethod {
    boolean[] decisionNodeList;
    boolean[] targetList;
    Map<Integer,List<Integer>> dependenciesMap;
    Map<Integer,List<Double>> decisionNodeBranchDistance;
}
 Option 2: (Objects) public class TraceMethod {
    ArrayList<Target> targets = new ArrayList<Target>(); 
    ArrayList<DecisionNode> decisionNodes = new ArrayList<DecisionNode>();
}

public class DecisionNode {
    int id;
    Double branchDistance;
    boolean reached;
}

public class Target {
    int id;
    boolean reached;
    List<DecisionNode> dependencies;
}
 I have implemented the option 2 by myself, but my boss suggest me the option 1 and he argue that is "lighter". I saw that in this article "Class Object vs Hashmap" that HashMaps use more memory than Objects, but im still not convinced that my solution(option 2) is better. Its a simple detail but i want to be sure that I am using the optimal solution, my concern is about performance(Space¡Vtime). I know that the second option are way better in term of maintainability but i can sacrifice that if its not optimal.
@CODE:public class TraceMethod {
    boolean[] decisionNodeList;
    boolean[] targetList;
    Map<Integer,List<Integer>> dependenciesMap;
    Map<Integer,List<Double>> decisionNodeBranchDistance;

@TITLE:EJB 2.1 doesn't preserve state across method calls in jboss 6.3
@CONTENT:We are in the process of migrating from jboss 4 to jboss 6. Out system has a ton of EJB 2.1 beans. Once we deployed the application in jboss 6, the beans stopped preserving state across method calls. IS this normal? if not, what can be done to overcome this problem? Edit:2015.08.04 Bean: Stateful I wish i could share src code but, the company has very strict policies. Any guidance or direction from your experience would suffice. More info Scenario: user updates a employee record. The system has a AbstractController which does single record updates. The controller looks up the bean and retrieves the handle to it. Then, using reflection it retrieves the method names. Then sets a flag 'isDirty' to true (setter inside the bean) The controller then iterates over the method names updating each field by calling the EJB store method. Within the store method before the update statement is run the flag 'isDirty' is checked. In jboss 4 this flag remains as 'true', but when we migrated into 6, this flag started to reverting back to false. FYI: This is legacy source, and i really wish i could change the logic, but i cant. Update: 2015.08.04: 3pm I placed a break point in the ejb activate and passivate methods. The beans are being passivated immediately after they are activated. continuing my investigation. Will keep this thread updated. Update: 2015.08.20 I built a sample application according to the EJB spec and ran it in both jboss 5.1 and 6.3 The two instances were identical. between method calls, the entity bean loses its state bean.doSomething();
bean.doSomethingElse();

 Did some further digging and i read this "The Bean Provider can use instance variables to store values that depend on the persistent state of the entity bean instance, although this use is not encouraged. The Bean Provider should use the ejbLoad method to resynchronize the values of any instance variables that depend on the entity bean¡¦s persistent state. In general, any non-persistent state that depends on the persistent state of an entity bean should be recomputed during the ejbLoad method." In other words, you are responsible for setting "isDirty" to the correct state during ejbLoad. You should not expect it to retain any specific value from one call to the next ¡V if it does, it's only because of a specific implementation or by accident.

@TITLE:Recycler View With Gridlayout Manager
@CONTENT:I'm using RecyclerView with GridLayout manager to make seat booking layout like travels. My problem is how to auto detect spancount when my column is random? I know spanCount = recyclerViewWidth / singleItemWidth;, but the problem is singleItemWidth is different, as the seat width is different. This is the desired layout that I want: ... but I'm currently getting something like this: This is the code I'm using to arrange the seat layout:     gridLayoutManager=new GridLayoutManager(this,totalRows, LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL,
            false);
    gridLayoutManager.setSpanSizeLookup(new GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {
        @Override
        public int getSpanSize(int position) {
            int rows=Integer.parseInt(upperlist.get(position).get("row"));
             return (rows);///(int) (mRecyclerView.getMeasuredWidth()/ 10);
        }
    });
     mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager( gridLayoutManager);
    MyAdapter myAdapter=new MyAdapter(this,gridArray);
 ... where upperlist hold these values:  [{cols=8, seatNumber=29U, row=4, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=6,seatNumber=23U, row=4, zindex=1},
  {cols=4,seatNumber=21U,row=4, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=2, seatNumber=11U, row=4, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=0,seatNumber=9U,row=4, zindex=1},

  {cols=8,seatNumber=25U, row=2, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=6,seatNumber=17U, row=2, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=4,seatNumber=13U, row=2, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=2,seatNumber=5U,  row=2, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=10, seatNumber=D2U,row=2, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=0, seatNumber=1U, row=2, zindex=1}, 

  {cols=8, seatNumber=26U, row=1, zindex=1},
  {cols=6,seatNumber=18U, row=1, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=4,seatNumber=14U, row=1, zindex=1},
  {cols=2,seatNumber=6U,  row=1, zindex=1}, 
  {cols=0,seatNumber=2U,  row=1, zindex=1}]
 This is a single list, where I'm having different values for rows and columns. I therefore need a generalized method which can work on all layouts.
@CODE:RecyclerView GridLayout spanCount = recyclerViewWidth / singleItemWidth; singleItemWidth gridLayoutManager=new GridLayoutManager(this,totalRows, LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL,

    gridLayoutManager.setSpanSizeLookup(new GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {
        @Override
        public int getSpanSize(int position) {
            int rows=Integer.parseInt(upperlist.get(position).get("row"));
             return (rows);///(int) (mRecyclerView.getMeasuredWidth()/ 10);

@TITLE:How can I multiply the score of two queries together in Elasticsearch?
@CONTENT:In Solr I can use the query function query to return a numerical score for a query and I can user that in the context of a bf parameter something like bf=product(query('cat'),query('dog')) to multiply two relevance scores together. Elasticsearch has search API that is generally more flexible to work with, but I can't figure out how I would accomplish the same feat. I can use _score in a script_function of a function_query but I can only user the _score of the main query. How can I incorporate the score of another query? How can I multiply the scores together?
@CODE:query bf bf=product(query('cat'),query('dog')) _score _score catQuery={!edismax qf=title^10 text v=$q} product($catQuery...)

                    |> Enum.map fn item_id -> String.to_integer(item_id) end

      Repo.update(%{item | position: index + 1})

 At first I thought it was just a line continuation symbol to keep code readable, but the Item |> where line above suggests otherwise. Is it a list comprehension or something specifying input types?

@TITLE:Taming the automatic telephone number thing in the windows 10 edge browser
@CONTENT:Windows 10's edge browser seems to detect phone numbers even if there's no phone app installed on the system. It formats the phone number in blue with an underline even if it's just in the plain text somewhere (ugly on some backgrounds), moreover it detects e.g. VAT numbers as if they were phone numbers. So how do we control it as webmasters to: how it renders the detected stuff (I suppose MSFT invented their very own CSS selector for this stuff?) how do we turn the detection off Preferably with something just targeting that browser and not risk messing up things for others or adding non-standard things to otherwise valid code. EDIT: The suggested way to turn detection off based on the way it is done in IE11 for windows phones does not work in all of my tests. The meta tag fails and the non-standard html attribute does seem to work. I've looked at the inspect thing in edge and it seems to me the computed CSS for those detected items is what one would expect to see there if it were not detected (i.e. the computed CSS is the normal color and no underline), suggesting little chance of controlling how it's rendered. EDIT: test case 1: meta tag (fails) <!DOCTYPE html>

@LINK:/questions/31685359/make-meteor-method-synchronous
@TITLE:Make Meteor method synchronous
@CONTENT:I've been attempting to make this function synchronous. I've read several Stack Overflow posts about Async but I'm unable to comprehend how I would be able to make this synchronous. As of now, it is asynchronous therefore it returns undefined before heading into the callback function. I call it from the client side: Meteor.call('screenName',function(error,result) {
        if (error) {
          console.log(error);
        }
        else {
          window.alert(result);
        }
      }
 And this is the server side method: Meteor.methods({
  'screenName': function() {
      T.get('search/tweets',
      {
        q:'#UCLA',
        count:1
      },
      function(err,data,response) {
        var temp = data.statuses[0].user.screen_name;
        console.log(temp);
        return temp;
      }
    )
  }
});
 I'm using the Twitter API and what I want to do is basically retrieve the screen name from the JSON and return it to a variable on the client side. But this is returning undefined because the callback is being compiled after the compiler has reached the end of the 'screenName' function. I want it to return the value from the callback function but reading up other examples has not helped me comprehend how I can transform my code. I need to make this function synchronous but I don't know how to do it.
@CODE:Meteor.call('screenName',function(error,result) {
        if (error) {
          console.log(error);
        }
        else {
          window.alert(result);
        }
      } Meteor.methods({
  'screenName': function() {
      T.get('search/tweets',
      {
        q:'#UCLA',
        count:1
      },
      function(err,data,response) {
        var temp = data.statuses[0].user.screen_name;

@TITLE:Is there a Rust library with an UTF-16 string type? (intended for writing a Javascript interpreter)
@CONTENT:For most programs, it's better to use UTF-8 internally and, when necessary, convert to other encodings. But in my case, I want to write a Javascript interpreter, and it's much simpler to store only UTF-16 strings (or arrays of u16), because I need to address 16-bits code units individually (this is a bad idea in general, but Javascript requires this). This means I need it to implement Index<usize>. I need to store unpaired surrogates, that is, malformed UTF-16 strings (because of this, ECMAScript strings are technically defined as arrays of u16, that usually represent UTF-16 strings). There is an encoding aptly named WTF-8 to store unpaired surrogates in UTF-8, but I don't want to use something like this. I want to have the usual owned / borrowed types (like String / str and CString / CStr) with all or most usual methods. I don't want to roll my own string type (if I can avoid). Also, my strings will always be immutable, behind an Rc and referred from a data structure containing weak pointers to all strings (implementing string interning). This might be relevant: perhaps it would be better to have Rc<Utf16Str> as the string type, where Utf16Str is the unsized string type (which can be defined as just struct Utf16Str([u16])). That would avoid following two pointers when accessing the string, but I don't know how to instantiate an Rc with an unsized type. Given the above requirements, merely using rust-encoding is very inconvenient, because it treats all non-UTF-8 encodings as vectors of u8. Also, I'm not sure if using the std library at all might help me here. I looked into Utf16Units and it's just an iterator, not a proper string type. (also, I know OsString doesn't help - I'm not on Windows, and it doesn't even implement Index<usize>)

@TITLE:How to filter an elasticsearch global aggregation?
@CONTENT:What I want to achieve: I want my "age" aggregation to not be filtered by the query filter and I want to be able to apply filters to it. So if I start with this query: {
    "query":{
        "filtered":{
            "filter":{ "terms":{ "family_name":"Brown" } } //filter_1
        }
    },
    "aggs":{
        "young_age":{
            "filter":{
                "range":{ "lt":40, "gt":18 } //filter_2
            },
            "aggs":{
                "age":{
                    "terms":{
                        "field":"age"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 My aggregation "young_age" will be filtered by both filter_1 and filter_2. I don't want my aggregation to be filtered by filter_1. As I was looking into the documentation, I thought global aggregation would solve my problem, and I wrote that query: {
    "query":{
        "filtered":{
            "filter":{ "terms":{ "family_name":"Brown" } } //filter_1
        }
    },
    "aggs":{
        "young_age":{
            "global":{}, //<----------- add global
            "filter":{
                "range":{ "lt":40, "gt":18 } //filter_2
            },
            "aggs":{
                "age":{
                    "terms":{
                        "field":"age"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 But then elastic search complains about my filter_2: """ Found two aggregation type definitions [age] in [global] and [filter] """ And of course if I remove the filter_2: {
    "query":{
        "filtered":{
            "filter":{
                "terms":{
                    "family_name":"Brown"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "aggs":{
        "young_age":{
            "global":{},
            "aggs":{
                "age":{
                    "terms":{
                        "field":"age"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 Then my aggregation won't be filtered by filter_1 (as expected). So how am I suppose to apply filter_2 to my global aggregation? Or how am I supposed to achieved that? I remember writing something similar with the facet filters...
@CODE:{
    "query":{
        "filtered":{
            "filter":{ "terms":{ "family_name":"Brown" } } //filter_1
        }
    },
    "aggs":{
        "young_age":{
            "filter":{
                "range":{ "lt":40, "gt":18 } //filter_2
            },
            "aggs":{
                "age":{
                    "terms":{
                        "field":"age"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

@TITLE:Insert emoji at cursor
@CONTENT:I already asked this question earlier on stack overflow but didnot get a answer. I have 2 links called add emoji 1 and add emoji 2. This was my ealier question. Insert smiley at cursor position Now, even when I had made certain changes and the here the problem is that smileys only insert at the end of the div and not at the cursor position. My new demo is at: https://jsfiddle.net/ftwbx88p/8/ $( document ).on( "click" , "#button" , function() {
   $( ".editable.focus" ).append( '<img src="https://cdn.okccdn.com/media/img/emojis/apple/1F60C.png"/>' );
});
 I want the smiley to insert in the respective contenteditable div where ever the cursor is. Thanks in advance. Note: I had a contenteditable div where I want to add image and not in the textarea.

@TITLE:How to use Abdera atom client to send content and attachment
@CONTENT:We are using Abdera to interact with the IBM Connections API, but our problem is mostly related to Abdera itself. I think there is a bug in Abdera that does not allow you send an Entry that contains content and attachments in a single request. As a workaround you would probably be able to send two separate requests to create first with content and update afterwards with attachment. Sadly the Connections API required you to have all data in a single request or your old data is not preserved. The following code shows an Abdera Entry that is created: ClassLoader classloader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
InputStream is = classloader.getResourceAsStream("google-trends.tiff");

final Abdera abdera = new Abdera();
Entry entry = abdera.getFactory().newEntry();
entry.setTitle("THIS IS THE TITLE");
entry.setContentAsHtml("<p>CONTENT AS HTML</p>");
entry.setPublished(new Date());

Category category = abdera.getFactory().newCategory();
category.setLabel("Entry");
category.setScheme("http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/sn/type");
category.setTerm("entry");
entry.addCategory(category);

RequestEntity request =
    new MultipartRelatedRequestEntity(entry, is, "image/jpg",
        "asdfasdfasdf");
 When the MultipartRelatedRequestEntity is created a NullPointer is thrown: java.lang.NullPointerException
    at
org.apache.abdera.protocol.client.util.MultipartRelatedRequestEntity.writeInput(MultipartRelatedRequestEntity.java:74)
 This happens because it is expecting a content "src" element, but after digging into the source code of Abdera it seems like this is not a required element according to the specification. This looks like a bug in the Abdera code, no? /**
 * <p>
 * RFC4287: atom:content MAY have a "src" attribute, whose value MUST be an IRI reference. If the "src" attribute is
 * present, atom:content MUST be empty. Atom Processors MAY use the IRI to retrieve the content and MAY choose to

 I have put a reference application connection to IBM Greenhouse Connections to show this, but have also included two unit tests in which the nullpointer can be tested without needing Connections. This can be found on GitHub
@CODE:ClassLoader classloader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();

For example, one could either cast its values into an array or manually translate its expression into Gnuplot¡¦s syntax. Here is an example that uses the module Gnuplot.py as an interface: #!/usr/bin/env python

import Gnuplot
import numpy as np

## define function ##
func = lambda x, x0, y0, w: y0 * np.exp( -4*np.log(2) * ( (x-x0) / w )**2 )
# also works with a regular function:
# def func(x, x0, y0, w):
    # return y0 * np.exp( -4*np.log(2) * ( (x-x0) / w )**2 )
popt = (10.1, 5, 2)

## linspace ##
x = np.linspace(0, 20, num=1000) # (x min, x max, number of points)
y = func(x, *popt)
func_linspace = Gnuplot.Data(x, y, with_='lines', title='linspace')

## expression ¡§translation¡¨ (lambda only) ##
func_translation = Gnuplot.Func(
    '{y0} * exp( -4*log(2) * ( (x-{x0}) / {w} )**2 )'.format(
        x0=popt[0],
        y0=popt[1],
        w=popt[2],
        ),
    title='expression translation')

## plot ##
g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
g.plot(func_linspace, func_translation)
 The first method works fine with a decent number of points but fails when zooming-in too much or changing the window out of the array¡¦s limits, while the second one works at any zoom level. To illustrate this point, let¡¦s zoom-in the output of the previous script: For this reason, it would be interesting to find a way to plot Python functions (lambda or regular functions) as Gnuplot functions. I can think of two solution: automatically translating the expression (works only for ¡§simple¡¨ lambda functions¡¨), or having Gnuplot directly use the Python function. First solution: expression translation (simple lambda functions only) This method would not only be tricky to automate, it would also be impossible to implement with elaborate functions. However we could still use this method for simple lambda functions. To sketch the behaviour of an implementation: >>> def lambda_to_gnuplot(func, popt):
...     # determine if translation is possible
...     # extract function expression and replace parameters with values
...     return func_expression # str
>>> lambda_to_gnuplot(
...     lambda x, x0, y0, w: y0 * np.exp( -4*np.log(2) * ( (x-x0) / w )**2),
...     (10.1, 5, 2))
'5 * exp( -4*log(2) * ( (x-10.1) / 2 )**2 )'
 Would there be a way to implement this lambda_to_gnuplot function in python? Second solution: directly passing the Python function to Gnuplot The ¡§perfect¡¨ solution would be having Gnuplot use the Python function. In my most daring dreams, it is something like: >>> def func(x, x0, y0, w):
...     if x < x0:
...         return 0
...     else:
...         return y0 * np.exp( -4*np.log(2) * ( (x-x0) / w )**2)
>>> func_direct = Gnuplot.PyFunction(lambda x: func(x, 10.1, 5, 2))
>>> g.plot(func_direct)
 This is the easiest solution to use, but its implementation would be very tough, if not impossible. Any hints on how this solution might be implemented? The answer may of course bypass Gnuplot.py.

@TITLE:ado.net model for db is gone Visual studio 2015
@CONTENT:After installing the community version of Visual Studio 2015, I've run into a problem with my database connector, the ADO.net model. I usually connect to that with EF 5 or 6 depending on whether I'm using MYSQL or SQL Server. But I've run in to the problem that I simply don't see it anymore. This is what I see: Compared to Visual Studio 2013: I've tried reinstalling EF6. However I can't find out if this is intentional or not. Does anyone have any idea what I should do? I'll obviously stick to VS2013 as of now. But I wanna get working with 2015 asap.

@TITLE:How to force account login for a single account user with Google's OAuth 2.0?
@CONTENT:Sometimes when a user logins into a site with Google's OAuth 2.0 they choose the wrong account to login with. Normally this isn't a problem if the user has more than one account registered with the browser, google will automatically show the user select screen: But if a user has only one account and is logged in, this screen is skipped. Instead I need Google's sign in panel to always appear, so that I can be sure the user has the option to try and enter the correct account. I tried using approval_prompt = "force", but that forces the acceptance of permissions rather than simply showing the login page. How can I force Google's OAuth 2.0 to always show the login screen? (and never automatically skip it)

This file is meant to be stored on the server (not downloaded) and later on, read by PHP. 1st attempt I tried to make a huge request to select all at once (as per this blog post) but this has, despite the use of ->iterate(), led to Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted after having run for ~9s.     ini_set('memory_limit', '1024M');
    ini_set('max_execution_time', -1);

    $results = $em
        ->getRepository('MyBundle:Entity')
        ->createQueryBuilder('e')
        ->getQuery()
        ->iterate();
    $handle = fopen('/path/to/csv/file/', 'w');
    while (false !== ($row = $results->next())) {
        fputcsv($handle, $row[0]->toArray());
        $em->detach($row[0]);
    }
    fclose($handle);
 2nd attempt I retrieved the total of rows and then, did a loop to make the same number of queries to retrieve rows one by one. But after having written ~260K rows into the .csv file, PHP runs out of memory and throws the same error as above : Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted.     ini_set('memory_limit', '1024M');
    ini_set('max_execution_time', -1);

    $total = (int) $em
        ->getRepository('MyBundle:Entity')
        ->countAll();
    $csv = '/path/to/csv/file';
    $handle = fopen($csv, 'w');
    for($i = 1; $i < $total; $i++)
    {
        $entity = $em->getRepository('MyBundle:Entity')->findOneById($i);
        fputcsv($handle, $entity->toArray());
        $em->detach($entity);
    }
    fclose($handle);
 3rd attempt I have thought of the use of the exec() function to run the MySQL command line that would export the table. However, my manager seems not to like this option. So am I making a fool of myself thinking that dumping ~9.5M of rows using PHP into a .csv file is even possible? Are there any other way I'm not yet aware of? Thanks for your help on this one.

@TITLE:how do I get rid of random background grid from arrangeGrob
@CONTENT:I need to wrap several plots in a grid, often an uneven number, so there'll often be an "empty spot". I need to use arrangeGrob() -- not grid.arrange() -- because I want to save the plot for later, not plot() it right away. This works fine, but oddly, arrangeGrob() leaves some weird background in the empty spots. Like so: library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=factor(cyl), y=mpg)) + geom_boxplot()
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=factor(cyl), y=wt)) + geom_boxplot()
p3 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x =factor(cyl), y=disp)) + geom_boxplot()
library(gridExtra)
y <- arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2)
plot(y)
 yields a plot with some weird gray stuff in the bottom right corner: Compare this to grid.arrange(): grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2)
 yields a pretty plot with no grey weirdness: Where does this gray stuff in the bottom right corner come from? And how do I get rid of it? Notice that I cannot avoid the empty spots by changing ncol; I sometimes have an uneven number of plots, so there'll always be empty spots. I'm ok with empty spots, I just like them to be clean. (In isolation, that last sentence sounds pretty OCD-ish. UPDATE The package author (?) answered below: I should have used grid.draw(y). A similar problem remains (maybe the same root cause?): if you plot some object before, the "empty spot" remains occupied by that past plot. Weird. Like so: plot(p1)
grid.draw(y)
 yields:
@CODE:arrangeGrob() grid.arrange() plot() arrangeGrob() library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=factor(cyl), y=mpg)) + geom_boxplot()
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=factor(cyl), y=wt)) + geom_boxplot()
p3 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x =factor(cyl), y=disp)) + geom_boxplot()
library(gridExtra)
y <- arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2)
plot(y) grid.arrange() grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2) ncol grid.draw(y) plot(p1)
grid.draw(y) plot(y) print(y) gridExtra grid.draw() grid.newpage() grid arrangeGrob grid.arrange ggplot

@TITLE:Spark UI on AWS EMR
@CONTENT:I am running a AWS EMR cluster with Spark (1.3.1) installed via the EMR console dropdown. Spark is current and processing data but I am trying to find which port has been assigned to the WebUI. I've tried port forwarding both 4040 and 8080 with no connection. I'm forwarding like so ssh -i ~/KEY.pem -L 8080:localhost:8080 hadoop@EMR_DNS
 1) How do I find out what the Spark WebUI's assigned port is? 2) How do I verify the Spark WebUI is running?

@LINK:/questions/31456483/bug-in-python-threading-thread-start-does-not-always-return
@TITLE:Bug in Python? threading.Thread.start() does not always return
@CONTENT:I have a tiny Python script which (in my eyes) makes threading.Thread.start() behave unexpectedly since it does not return immediately. Inside a thread I want to call a method from a boost::python based object which will not return immediately. To do so I wrap the object/method like this: import threading
import time
import my_boostpython_lib

my_cpp_object = my_boostpython_lib.my_cpp_class()

def some_fn():
    # has to be here - otherwise .start() does not return
    # time.sleep(1)  
    my_cpp_object.non_terminating_fn() # blocks

print("%x: 1" % threading.get_ident())
threading.Thread(target=some_fn).start()
print("%x: 2" % threading.get_ident())  # will not always be called!!
 And everything works fine as long as I run some code before my_cpp_object.non_terminating_fn(). If I don't, .start() will block the same way as calling .run() directly would. Printing just a line before calling the boost::python function is not enough, but e.g. printing two lines or calling time.sleep() makes start() return immediately as expected. Can you explain this behavior? How would I avoid this (apart from calling sleep() before calling a boost::python function)?
@CODE:threading.Thread.start() boost::python import threading
import time
import my_boostpython_lib

my_cpp_object = my_boostpython_lib.my_cpp_class()

def some_fn():
    # has to be here - otherwise .start() does not return
    # time.sleep(1)  
    my_cpp_object.non_terminating_fn() # blocks

print("%x: 1" % threading.get_ident())
threading.Thread(target=some_fn).start()
print("%x: 2" % threading.get_ident())  # will not always be called!! my_cpp_object.non_terminating_fn() .start() .run() boost::python time.sleep() start() sleep() boost::python

 So it is clear to me that my tests blow up while the test database is being setup. Specifically, the attempt to create a foreign key constraint between the otp_static_staticdevice table and my app's app_user table fails. My immediate question is, why does django create the OTP table before my app's table? My assumption is that the OTP app is listed first in my INSTALLED_APPS. But this is not the case: INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.humanize',
    'app',
    ...
    'django_otp',
    'django_otp.plugins.otp_static',
    'django_otp.plugins.otp_totp',
    'two_factor',
    ...
]
 Next, I look at django/core/management/commands/migrate.py, trying to find out how django determines its order for migrating apps. Plopping a pdb.set_trace() statement on line 264 (https://github.com/django/django/blob/1.8.3/django/core/management/commands/migrate.py#L264) and looking to see what app_labels contains, I get: set(['djangosaml2', 'django_ace', 'recurly', 'staticfiles', 'distributedlock', 'app_overrides', 'messages', 'django_otp', 'kombu_transport_django', 'otp_totp', 'compressor', 'otp_static', 'humanize', 'ajax_select', 'django_extensions', 'import_export', 'raven_compat', 'crispy_forms', 'emoji'])
 This is as far as I have gotten before I decided to ask for help. Does anyone know how Django might end up not creating all the project's apps in the correct order so that decency conflicts do not occur?

@CONTENT:I started working with the new Lwjgl 3 which uses GLFW for its Display/mouse/keyboard handling and I'm really liking it! However today i hit a brick. I had a simple rendering animation going but when I dragged the screen it stopped rendering until i let go again. According to: http://www.glfw.org/faq.html The problem arises due to windows. 3.5 - Why does my application freeze when I move or resize the window? The Windows event loop is blocked by certain actions like dragging or resizing a window, or opening the window menu. This is part of the design of Windows and cannot be changed by GLFW. If you wish to keep rendering during such actions, you should render from a secondary thread. --http://www.glfw.org/faq.html Ive done multi threaded things before in Java. But im not sure what goes in its own thread for this case. Should I have the opengl code and the GLFW code in seperate threads? I'm also having trouble thinking of a way to word my concerns.

@TITLE:TCL max size of array
@CONTENT:I'm working on an engineering application, and the interface is written in TCL TK. Everything went fine until I need to use a (extremely) large array. 370.000.000 of elements, each element from 2 to 10 characters length (linear grown). My question is, ?where is the size limit for TCL arrays? I've been reading and investigating and the only I've found is "2GB" of string data, but I dont know if it's reliable because it doesn't explain the reason. I did an experiment: set lista [list ]
catch {
    for {set i 0} {$i < 370000000} {incr i} {
        lappend lista $i
    }
}
puts $i
 returns $i = 50.000.000 more or less on a 32 bits Windows 7

@TITLE:Inconsistent gcc diagnostic for string initialization
@CONTENT:I'm using gcc 4.9.1/Mingw and compiling the code with: gcc test.c -otest.exe -std=c11 -pedantic-errors -Wall -Wextra This code gives a diagnostic: int main (void)
{
  char a[5] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'};
}
 error: excess elements in array initializer char a[5] However, this code does not yield a warning: int main (void)
{
  char b[5] = "hello";
}
 I thought the two forms were 100% equivalent. Is there any reason or subtlety in the C standard etc why the latter should not give a warning? Or is this a compiler bug? I know that the C standard allows excess initializers, unlike C++, so formally I don't believe gcc is required to give a diagnostic. But I would expect the compiler to give warnings consistently.

@CONTENT:I would like to ask- is it possible to connect to MySql database in DNX Core 5.0? In my project I need to do web api and I have vNext Class Library project that should connect to MySql database and manipulate the data in this database. But... I have the newest .net/connector installed. I have downloaded the MySql.Data NuGet package and in references it is added to both- DNX 4.5.1 and Core 5.0 as well. But I get error- functions such as open the connection to my database, execute query etc are not available in DNX Core 5.0. The code is working in Visual Studio 2013 and in DNX 4.5.1 as well. I am not able to find any answer how to connect in DNX Core 5.0 to MySql (neither if it is even possible). I was advised to downolad the source code of the newest connector/net and copy the code for MySql.Data to new vNext Class Library project and add reference to my Class Library that is supposed to access the database. But I have approx 1600 errors. I was told to solve them one by one. But that seems to be even bigger problem. It looks like it would be possible to solve by adding several references but I cannot find the equivalent reference that would work for DNX Core 5.0. Is this a good approach? I would appreciate any help. Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/31268002/using-java-card-instead-of-sim-in-android-with-seek
@TITLE:using java card instead of SIM in android with SEEK
@CONTENT:I've patched android with SEEK for Galaxy S3 and after some struggle I'm now able to send APDUs to SIM card and get proper responses. I want to place my own applet inside SIM but since there is no way we can get the access to do so, I start to wonder if there is anyway we can issue a java card to work like a SIM card. All I need is a java card that the phone can't distinguish from a SIM, no network coverage is needed and I know it is almost impossible to create a SIM that works OK with operator and gives network coverage. The reason for all this is I need to send APDUs and work with my applet, but if I insert a java card instead of a SIM card in GS3, it gives me no access at all. So my question is this: Is it possible to issue a java card so that it looks like a SIM by the phone (and not the operator)? or Is it possible to change android so that it gives needed access when there is a java card in it, i.e. RIL works as usual? EDIT Okay, I think I'll try to issue a Java Card with following properties: First, it will have an auto selected applet (default applet) that from now on will be call fake-UICC. Second, in fake-UICC we'll emulate the file system of UICC (according to http://www.in2eps.com/fo-uicc/tk-fo-uicc-mf.html). Third, since different class is used for SIM APDUs (0xA0) so All APDUs sent from RIL will be directed to fake-UICC by JCRE, since class+instruction is not recognized by normal Java Card. e.g. 0xA0A4 is select for SIM but 0x00A4 is select command for Java Card. In last step, we will try to send exact same responses a real SIM would send to each APDU. Maybe it won't work but I think it's worth a try.

@TITLE:Unexpected Scalability results in Java Fork-Join (Java 8)
@CONTENT:Recently, I was running some scalability experiments using Java Fork-Join. Here, I used the non-default ForkJoinPool constructor ForkJoinPool(int parallelism), passing the desired parallelism (# workers) as constructor argument. Specifically, using the following piece of code: public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool(Integer.parseInt(args[0]));
    pool.invoke(new ParallelLoopTask());    
}

static class ParallelLoopTask extends RecursiveAction {

    final int n = 1000;

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        RecursiveAction[] T = new RecursiveAction[n];
        for(int p = 0; p < n; p++){
            T[p] = new DummyTask();
            T[p].fork();
        }
        for(int p = 0; p < n; p++){
            T[p].join();
        }
        /*
        //The problem does not occur when tasks are joined in the reverse order, i.e.
        for(int p = n-1; p >= 0; p--){
            T[p].join();
        }
        */
    }
}


static public class DummyTask extends RecursiveAction {
    //performs some dummy work

    final int N = 10000000;

    //avoid memory bus contention by restricting access to cache (which is distributed)
    double val = 1;

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        for(int j = 0; j < N; j++){
            if(val < 11){
                val *= 1.1;
            }else{
                val = 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
 I got these results on a processor with 4 physical and 8 logical cores (Using java 8: jre1.8.0_45): T1: 11730 T2: 2381 (speedup: 4,93) T4: 2463 (speedup: 4,76) T8: 2418 (speedup: 4,85) While when using java 7 (jre1.7.0), I get T1: 11938 T2: 11843 (speedup: 1,01) T4: 5133 (speedup: 2,33) T8: 2607 (speedup: 4,58) (where TP is the execution time in ms, using parallelism level P) While both results surprise me, the latter I can understand (the join will cause 1 worker (executing the loop) to block, as it fails to recognize that it could, while waiting, process other pending dummy tasks from its local queue). The former, however, got me puzzled. BTW: When counting the number of started, but not yet completed dummy tasks, I found that up to 24 such tasks existed in a pool with parallelism 2 at some point in time...?

 At first sight one would think these scalability results are closer to what one would expect i.e. T1 < T2 < T4 ~ T8. However, what still bugs me is the following: The difference for T2 between java 7 and 8. I guess one explanation would be that the worker executing the parallel loop does not go idle in java 8, but instead finds other work to perform. The super-linear speedup (3x) with 2 workers. Also, note that T2 seems to increase with every iteration (see below, note that this is also the case, although to a smaller extent with P=4,8). The times in the first iterations of the warmup are similar to those mentioned above. Maybe the warmup period should be longer, but still, isn't it strange that execution time increases, i.e. I'd rather expect it to decrease? Finally, I still find the observation that there are a lot more started & not completed dummy tasks than worker threads curious. > Run progress: 0,00% complete, ETA 00:00:40

@TITLE:CSS flexbox: difference between align-items and align-content [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Flexbox ask: What's the difference between align-content and align-items 2 answers I find the difference between align-items and align-content in CSS flexbox properties extremely confusing. I've been looking at the docs, and several examples online for hours, but still can't fully grasp it. To be more precise, align-items makes total sense to me and it's completely clear how it behaves. On the other hand, align-content is not clear at all. In particular, I don't understand why we should use two different properties depending on whether the content all fits in one line or multiple ones. Can anyone help explaining it in layman's terms? Thanks!

@TITLE:Swift 2.0 'inout' function parameters and computed properties
@CONTENT:I'm testing Swift 2.0 beta right now and have found strange behaviour. Here is a sample code: private func someFunc(inout someString: String) {
    print("Inside \'someFunc()\'")

    print(someString)
    someString = "Some another string"
}

private var someAncillaryInt = 42

print(someAncillaryInt)

private var someString: String {
    get {
        print("Inside \'getter\'")

        return "Some string"
    }
    set {
        print("Inside \'setter\'")
        someAncillaryInt = 24
    }
}

someFunc(&someString)
print(someAncillaryInt)
 Output: 42 Inside 'getter' Inside 'someFunc()' Some string Inside 'setter' 24 I don't understand why wasn't getter called while printing someString inside someFunc() and why was it when someFunc() got passed with someString. One can assume that I don't understand intricacies of inout parameters yet and after being passed as inout parameter computed property stops being, em, "computed", but why then was 'setter' called when we set another value to someString? Thanks! UPD: I added answer below. UPDATE 18/11/2015: Apple has updated their manual with detailed explanation of how inout params work.
@CODE:private func someFunc(inout someString: String) {
    print("Inside \'someFunc()\'")

    print(someString)
    someString = "Some another string"
}

private var someAncillaryInt = 42

print(someAncillaryInt)

private var someString: String {
    get {
        print("Inside \'getter\'")

        return "Some string"
    }

Before I used xlrd and xlsxwriter and I did manage to make some useful programs. But right now I need a .xlsx reader&writer. There is a File which I need to read and edit with data already stored in the code. Let's suppose the .xlsx has five columns with data: A, B, C, D, E. In column A, I've over 1000 rows with data. On Column D, I've 150 rows with data. Basically, I want the program to find the last row with data on a given column (say D). Then, write the stored variable data in the next available row (last row + 1) in column D. The problem is that I can't use ws.get_highest_row() because it returns the row 1000 on column A. Basically, so far this is all I've got: data = 'xxx'
from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('book.xlsx', use_iterators=True)
ws = wb.get_sheet_by_name('Sheet1')
last_row = ws.get_highest_row()

@TITLE:Oracle 11G - Performance effect of indexing at insert
@CONTENT:Objective Verify if it is true that insert records without PK/index plus create thme later is faster than insert with PK/Index. Note The point here is not about indexing takes more time (it is obvious), but the total cost (Insert without index + create index) is higher than (Insert with index). Because I was taught to insert without index and create index later as it should be faster. Environment Windows 7 64 bit on DELL Latitude core i7 2.8GHz 8G memory & SSD HDD Oracle 11G R2 64 bit Background I was taught that insert records without PK/Index and create them after insert would be faster than insert with PK/Index. However 1 million record inserts with PK/Index was actually faster than creating PK/Index later, approx 4.5 seconds vs 6 seconds, with the experiments below. By increasing the records to 3 million (999000 -> 2999000), the result was the same. Conditions The table DDL is below. One bigfile table space for both data and index. (Tested a separate index tablespace with the same result & inferior overall perforemace) Flush the buffer/spool before each run. Run the experiment 3 times each and made sure the results were similar. SQL to flush: ALTER SYSTEM CHECKPOINT;
ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH SHARED_POOL;
ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH BUFFER_CACHE;
 Question Would it be actually true that "insert witout PK/Index + PK/Index creation later" is faster than "insert with PK/Index"? Did I make mistakes or missed some conditions in the experiment? Insert records with PK/Index TRUNCATE TABLE TBL2;

@TITLE:Alexa not finding my Skill
@CONTENT:I created my Alexa Skill as an AWS Lambda Node.js app based on one of the provided examples in the Alexa Skills Kit. I followed all the instructions: My Echo is registered with the same account as my developer account on AWS I configured my Skill on the Amazon developer console I put my application ID from the console into my application code I uploaded my code to the AWS Lambda service (set to N. Virginia, as instructed) I tested my service and it returned the expected JSON I entered my ARN as the endpoint back in the developer console On the next step in the console it tells me to test the skill with Echo by saying "Alexa, ask HelloWorld". When I do this, she replies "There was a problem communicating with the requested application." In the Echo app it says: Unexpected Communication Issue HelloWorld Request Identifier: amzn1.echo-api.request.e2d17280-592a-474f-a6b1-d1a9d8ff816d There was a problem communicating with the requested application I can see from my AWS Lambda functions list that no requests have reached the service. I restarted Echo. I gave it an hour in case it just needed time to propagate somewhere, but it still gives the same response. So this is a pretty ambiguous dead end. Has anyone ran into this? Any ideas what to try?

@TITLE:Play Framework: Dependecy Inject Action Builder
@CONTENT:since Play Framework 2.4 there is the possibility to use dependency injection (with Guice). Before I used objects (for example AuthenticationService) in my ActionBuilders: object AuthenticatedAction extends ActionBuilder[AuthenticatedRequest] {
  override def invokeBlock[A](request: Request[A], block: (AuthenticatedRequest[A]) => Future[Result]): Future[Result] = {
    ...
    AuthenticationService.authenticate (...)
    ...
  }
}
 Now AuthenticationService is not an object anymore, but a class. How can I still use the AuthenticationService in my ActionBuilder?
@CODE:AuthenticationService object AuthenticatedAction extends ActionBuilder[AuthenticatedRequest] {
  override def invokeBlock[A](request: Request[A], block: (AuthenticatedRequest[A]) => Future[Result]): Future[Result] = {
    ...
    AuthenticationService.authenticate (...)

@TITLE:Subsampling a huge json array with Haskell
@CONTENT:I have a huge Json file that I would like to avoid loading entirely to memory. Its structure is pretty simple: it consists of a large array with arbitrary elements inside. I'd simply like to transform the array by randomly dropping most of the elements, and simply outputting the transformed Json. Haskell seems well suited to this problem with all the laziness, and I thought it would make a nice Haskell exercise (I'm not an expert, and I don't know much FP theory). I've found pipes-aeson [1] which seems to be what I want, but after trying for a while, I have to admit I'm stuck. There are almost no examples, and while I can work with Pipes to downsample data, working with a Parser object seems more complicated. The option I've found (evalStateT) is strict and parses the whole thing, without letting me intervene. Maybe Lenses would be the solution to my problem, but they're very abstract I don't get what they are nor how to use them. Could someone more knowledgeable than I am provide a little guidance?

@TITLE:Looping over the map function in protractor
@CONTENT:I have an angular application where I have a timeline with list event dates and the respective event description. This is the Html source code.   <!-- timeline -->
  <h4 class="font-thin m-t-lg m-b-lg text-primary-lt">Historical Timeline</h4>
  <p></p>
  <div id="timeline"class="timeline m-l-sm m-r-sm b-info b-l">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- / timeline -->
 Now I am basically trying to make use protractor to ensure that the correct event date matches the event description. So i decided to use a map function. The issue is I would have a variable x which would tell me how many events there are . For example there can be 2 events, 6 events, etc. Events are dynamically generated dynamically as you can tell by looking at html code also. Here is the code for my test I wrote. it('FOO TEST', function(){


    var x = 0;
    while(x<4){
   var timeline = element.all(by.css('#timeline')).map(function (timeline) {
       return {
          date: timeline.element(by.css('#eventDate'+x)).getText(),
          events: timeline.element(by.css('#eventDescription'+x)).getText()
     }

   });
      x++
  }

   timeline.then(function (Value) {
    console.log(Value);  
  });

});
 The issue is that for some reason in command line it only prints the last event out of 5 events. It does not print other events. I am definitely doing something wrong. I am brand new to promises so any suggestion here is appreciated. And yes i want to do like a individual test for each event in the timeline.
@CODE:<!-- timeline -->
  <h4 class="font-thin m-t-lg m-b-lg text-primary-lt">Historical Timeline</h4>
  <p></p>
  <div id="timeline"class="timeline m-l-sm m-r-sm b-info b-l">
    <div  ng-repeat = "timeline in formattedTimelineData | orderBy : '-eventDate'">
      <div class = "tl-item">
        <i class="pull-left timeline-badge {{timeline.class}} "></i>
        <div class="m-l-lg">
          <div id="eventDate{{$index}}" class="timeline-title">{{timeline.eventDate}}</div>
          <p id="eventDescription{{$index}}" class="timeline-body">{{timeline.description}}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- / timeline --> it('FOO TEST', function(){


    var x = 0;
    while(x<4){
   var timeline = element.all(by.css('#timeline')).map(function (timeline) {
       return {
          date: timeline.element(by.css('#eventDate'+x)).getText(),
          events: timeline.element(by.css('#eventDescription'+x)).getText()
     }

   });
      x++
  }

   timeline.then(function (Value) {
    console.log(Value);  
  });

});

@TITLE:Statsmodels mosaic plot ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
@CONTENT:I have a simple pandas DataFrame, for which I would like to create a mosaic plot. Here is my code: import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot import mosaic 

mydata = pd.DataFrame({'id2': {64: 'Angelica', 
                               65: 'DXW_UID', 66: 'casuid01', 
                               67: 'casuid01', 68: 'EC93_uid', 
                               69: 'EC93_uid', 70: 'EC93_uid', 
                               60: 'DXW_UID',  61: 'AtmosFox', 
                               62: 'DXW_UID', 63: 'DXW_UID'}, 
                       'id1': {64: 'TGP', 
                               65: 'Retention01', 66: 'default',
                               67: 'default', 68: 'Musa_EC_9_3', 
                               69: 'Musa_EC_9_3', 70: 'Musa_EC_9_3', 
                               60: 'default', 61: 'default', 
                               62: 'default', 63: 'default'}})

mydata
            id1       id2
60      default   DXW_UID
61      default  AtmosFox
62      default   DXW_UID

69  Musa_EC_9_3  EC93_uid
70  Musa_EC_9_3  EC93_uid

[11 rows x 2 columns]
 I can create a mosaic plot just fine when I exclude row 64. mosaic(mydata[mydata.id1!='TGP'], ['id1','id2'])

 The plot comes out fine (with the exception of some of the labels looking a little funny--but that's not the issue). The errors occur when I include row 64. My questions are, why does this row cause this error, and how can I fix it? I can see that the error occurs when trying to draw the image, but it is not at all obvious where the NaN is coming from, especially since the plot before worked just fine. mosaic(mydata, ['id1','id2'])

 I ran the above code in the spyder IDE, with default settings. A similar issue was addressed here, and numerical underflow was the culprit. However, if that is the case here, it is not at all obvious why.

@TITLE:How does publishing android libraries that can be imported easily by other people work?
@CONTENT:It is possible to easily use third party libraries with gradle. For example, the following allows me to use Retrofit in my app.    dependencies {
       compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:1.9.0'
   }
 How does this work? Where does the library come from? In general terms, how would I go about publishing a library so that other people can import it like this? Note: this is not a duplicate of Publish jar library to bintray using gradle/publish-jar-library-to-bintray-using-gradle. That question was asking a spefic question about one particular way to publish libraries.

@LINK:/questions/31010659/phonegap-mobile-app-tapping-while-scrolling-selects-incorrect-item
@TITLE:Phonegap mobile app tapping while scrolling selects incorrect item
@CONTENT:I have a hybrid mobile app developed with phone gap and targeted for iOS only devices. I use Backbone.js as my MVC framework, jQuery, FastClick.js and Hammer.js for events. I have a list of items which is vertically scrollable. If I tap on an item, it should open the details view. This works fine if I tap on the item when the list is not scrolling. But if I tap on an item while the list is scrolling or decelerating, it selects the wrong item and shows its details. I looked at Tapping on scrolled list generates tap event for wrong element, javascript scroll event for iPhone/iPad? and other sites which suggest that I listen to the onscroll event of my scrolling list. This event is fired whenever the user scrolls the list. I disable the tap event in the callback for onscroll. I set a timer in the callback with timeout of 300ms and then enable the tap event in that callback which executes after 300 ms. If I get another scroll event before the timer fires, I cancel the earlier timer and set it again to fire after 300ms. There is no other event that gets fired when the scrolling stops completely. So, I have to rely on this event only. The issue is the event fires even when the scrolling is decelerating and not completely stopped. Due to this, the timer gets fired even while the list is decelerating and not stopped and I run into the wrong details selection issue again. The event fires again when the scroll stops completely as well. If I increase my timer to be >300ms, then in case of non-momentum scroll, it takes longer for the tap to be enabled and the user will keep tapping multiple times. Below are the code snippets: When view loads, bind the tap event and the onscroll event: that.$('.scrollListItem').hammer().bind('tap',$.proxy(that.showDetail,that));
this.$('#scrollList').bind('scroll',$.proxy(this.checkscroll,this));
 checkscroll function checkScroll: function(e){
  this.$('.scrollListItem').hammer().unbind('tap');
  clearTimeout(myGlobalScrollTimer);
  var that = this;
  myGlobalScrollTimer = setTimeout(function(){              
    that.$('.scrollListItem').hammer().bind('tap',$.proxy(that.showDetail,that));
  },300);
}
 The checkScroll function is firing currently even while the scroll list is decelerating and it hasn't stopped completely. How do I detect that the scrolling is completely stopped and the UI is no longer decelerating and only then enable the tap event? Is there any other way to solution this? Please advice.
@CODE:onscroll tap onscroll that.$('.scrollListItem').hammer().bind('tap',$.proxy(that.showDetail,that));
this.$('#scrollList').bind('scroll',$.proxy(this.checkscroll,this)); checkscroll checkScroll: function(e){
  this.$('.scrollListItem').hammer().unbind('tap');
  clearTimeout(myGlobalScrollTimer);
  var that = this;
  myGlobalScrollTimer = setTimeout(function(){

@TITLE:Circular dependency in pandas dataframe
@CONTENT:The following code places bets on coin flip results. You start with ?100 and risk 5% on each flip, but because my code calculates bet size based on your starting balance, the bet is always ?5. import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

start_bal = 100.0 #start off with ?100
risk = 0.05 # risk 5% on each bet

#create an empty data frame.
a = pandas.DataFrame()

#create a list of coin toss results, 1 is win, -1 is lose
a['Result'] = [1,1,1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,1]

#your bet size is a % of your starting balance
a['bet'] = start_bal*risk
#record profit or loss based on coin toss
a['pnl'] = a.Result * a.bet
#increase/decrease balance
a['bal'] = start_bal + a.pnl.cumsum()

#plot balance
plt.plot(a.bal)
 What I would like to do is re-calculate bet size after each bet depending on your balance at that time so you're betting more when your balance increases and less when it decreases. This would mean that 'bal' depends on the 'bet', which in turn depends on 'bal' so I end up with a circular relationship. Is this possible to do? Would I need to iterate through the dataframe one row at a time, re-calculating the 'bal' and 'bet' at that particular index? Thanks.

How come ? I come from python/sphinx, and sites like readthedocs.org manage perfectly mobile friendliness in the HTML generation (IMO), whereas the most popular documentation system around can't ? I must be missing something. I tried looking around the interwebs for some HTML theme minimising problems, but no one even mentions the pain of trying to browse API references from a phone (yes, I do that :p) Anyone experience the same problems or has a solution / workaround ?

 The output is: Deduced type for T is: 4TypeI**PKi**E
 So T is actually deduced as a pointer to a constant integer. The fact that the argument is a reference-to-const does not change the deduction, which is what one would expect because the constness of the pointer is low-level. but with array of const Nonetheless, if following statements are executed: const int ia[3] = {3, 2, 1};

 So T is actually deduced as an array of 3 non-const integers. The fact that the argument is a reference-to-const does change the deduction, as if the const was slipping into the array elements. Actually, versions of CL up to 18 were deducing T as array of 3 const integers was what I expected to be standard, but it seems that since v19 it converged to what GCC and Clang are doing (i.e., deducing as non-const). Thus, I assume the later behaviour to be standard, but was is the rationale ? It could seem surprising that it does not behave like with pointers. Edit: Following dip comment, I will report here pointers to CWG issues related to this behaviour, pointers he actually posted as a comment on this answer (answer that actually raised this new question... C++ feels like a deep tunnel) CWG 1059 CWG 1610 CWG 112

@LINK:/questions/30880827/how-to-obtain-deep-copies-of-julia-composite-types
@TITLE:How to obtain deep copies of Julia composite types?
@CONTENT:So here is the setting. I have multiple composite types defined with their own fields and constructors. Lets show two simplified components here: type component1
    x
    y
end

type component2
    x
    y
    z
end
 Now I want to define a new type such that It can save an array of size K of previously defined composite types in it. So it is a parametric composite type with two fields: one is an integer K, and the other is an array of size K of the type passed. type mixture{T}
    components::Array{T, 1}
    K::Int64

    function mixture(qq::T, K::Int64)
        components = Array{typeof(qq), K}
        for k in 1:K
            components[k] = qq
        end
        new(components, K)
    end
end
 But this is not the correct way to do it. Because all the K components are referring to one object and manipulating mixture.components[k] will affect all K components. In python I can remedy this with deepcopy. But the deepcopy in Julia is not defined for composite types. How do I solve this problem?
@CODE:type component1
    x
    y
end

type component2
    x
    y
    z
end type mixture{T}
    components::Array{T, 1}
    K::Int64

    function mixture(qq::T, K::Int64)
        components = Array{typeof(qq), K}
        for k in 1:K
            components[k] = qq
        end
        new(components, K)
    end

@TITLE:Why doesn't CSS transition get applied?
@CONTENT:I've built a small stacked bar visual just using floated divs that underneath is bound to some data using knockout. What I want to be able to do is to animate changes in the size of these stacks when the data changes. I've managed to do this in the general case, so of the 4 bars that I've got, 3 of them transition correctly. The problem is my final bar seems to ignore the transition and instantly re-sizes and I can't understand why. Here's a picture of the before/during/after states: The way that I've defined this transition is simply via css -webkit-transition: width 1s;
transition: width 1s;
 The width of the bars is a computed value, calculating the percentage of items, so each bar should have it's width defined as a percentage. Although the red bar is calculated differently to the other 3 bars, I don't see why that should affect the transition. What I find quite strange, is that if I modify the width through the developer console for example, then the bar does correctly animate. I'm wondering if anyone can suggest why this might be the case? var vm = (function generateModel() {

@TITLE:Docker container http requests limit
@CONTENT:I'm new to Docker so, most likely, I'm missing something. I'm running a container with Elasticsearch, using this image. I'm able to setup everyhing correctly. After that I was a using a script developed by a collegue in order to insert some data, basically querying a MySQL database and making HTTP requests . Problem is, many of those requests get stuck until it fails. If I do netstat -tn | grep 9200 I get: tcp6       0      0 ::1:58436               ::1:9200                TIME_WAIT  
tcp6       0      0 ::1:59274               ::1:9200                TIME_WAIT 

...
tcp6       0      0 ::1:58436               ::1:9200                TIME_WAIT

 with a lot of requests. At this point I'm not sure if it's something related to elastic search or docker. This does not happen if Elasticsearch is instaleld on my machine. Some info: $ docker version

@LINK:/questions/30835980/c-error-deduced-conflicting-types-for-parameter-t-string-vs-const-char
@TITLE:C++ error: deduced conflicting types for parameter 'T' string vs const char *
@CONTENT:So, I am writing a simple, templated search function for deque container. Here's the code:     template <typename T>
    void searchInDequeFor(std::deque<T> Deque, T searchValue)
    {
        for(const auto & element : Deque)
        {
            if(Deque.empty())
            {
                std::cout << "Deque is empty, nothing to search for..." << "\n";
            }
            else if(element==searchValue)
            {
                std::cout << searchValue << " matches " << element << ", an element in the deque" << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
 And, here's how I am calling the function in main:         deque<string> myDeque={"apple", "banana", "pear", "blueberry"};
        searchInDequeFor(myDeque,"pear");
 This is the error I am getting: candidate template ignored: deduced conflicting types for parameter 'T' ('std::__1::basic_string<char>' vs. 'const char *')
 Now, I've tested this function with integers, floats, doubles, etc., and it runs fine with those types, meaning my templating is working (for these types). This makes me wonder why I am getting this error when the function clearly knows that I am passing in a deque of type string and not of type const char *. Any help would be brilliant. Thanks!

    void searchInDequeFor(std::deque<T> Deque, T searchValue)
    {

            if(Deque.empty())
            {

            {

@TITLE:Pass parameters while instantiating of the controller class in JavaFX
@CONTENT:I am working on JavaFX application right now. All my gui is in .fxml format and through controller class manages all gui components. However, I have difficulties with instantiating the controller class before I load FXML loader. The reason why I am instantiating the controller class is that I want to pass some parameters so that these parameters will be displayed in GUI. I am loading an FXML file the following way: /*

@FXML
private void pressWorkOrder() throws Exception{ 
    WorkOrderController wo = new WorkOrderController("ashdkjhsahd");    //instantiating constructor     

    Parent parent = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("/fxml/WorkOrder.fxml"));        
    Scene scene = new Scene(parent);
    Stage stage = new Stage();
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.setTitle("Word Order");
    stage.setResizable(false);
    stage.show();
}
 And here is my actual Controller class: public class WorkOrderController implements Initializable{

     @FXML
     private Button summary;
     private String m,n;

     public WorkOrderController(String str) {
         // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub

     }  

     //for testing
     public void set(String str){
         m = str;
     }  

     @FXML
     public void check(){
         System.out.println("Output after constructor was initialized " + m);
     }

     @Override
     public void initialize(URL location, ResourceBundle resources) {

@TITLE:CSS family tree alignment issues with name length
@CONTENT:I started with the experimental multi-parent version of the CSS3 Family Tree: http://thecodeplayer.com/experiment/css3-family-tree/2 However I am having some alignment issues with multiple parents (partners in a family tree), which seem to be caused by the length of the text in boxes. If two boxes have the same length text they line up, otherwise the longer one is higher, and the difference in height is proportional to the difference in length. Also, any child on there own seems to float off to the left rather than sitting centrally as they should. EDIT: THIS PART HAS BEEN ANSWERED Examples here: http://jsfiddle.net/7g7fz2tL/5/ * {

@TITLE:Common regex for multiple data format strings
@CONTENT:I have the data in the below format. The strings can be in any order, but a max of two entries on a line. It can also have only one entry in a line. I'm trying hard from past two days to write a regex for the below conditions. If I split the string with the number of spaces, the value is getting split. If I split the string with ) if the value comes first before the occurrence of ) as in line 1 or two, the string will not be split. Any advice? I defined the below regex that captures different part of the string. \(([^)]+)\)
\(.+\)
 However, I'm unable to build a regex that matches the data as below. Note: Out of the 7 lines shown below, each line is an input string and not everything as a whole. VALUE1                                PARAMETER(VALUE2)

@TITLE:Dynamic update of dom-repeat templates by changing the underlying array
@CONTENT:Is there a Polymer dom api method or other ways to automatically update the repeated template with additional elements, should the underlying array gets updated? I have a dynamic array that gets updated through ajax calls repeatedly. This array keeps changing its length (elements get incrementally appended or removed based on the ajax response). The array is reflected in the document through <template is="dom-repeat">. Is there a way to automatically update the dom when the underlying array gets updated? At present, the only ways I can see are Identifying the incremental updates and manually append or delete the nodes. Delete the entire repeat template container and restamp a new template. I do not know of anyway to stamp a new template dynamically either. Is this possible? One way I can think of achieving this is having another custom element that does repeat template stamping and whenever there is an array update, delete the current element, append a new element by passing the updated array to the element. By using 2, I will not be able to use the transition effects of the list automatically updating in the view. I want to be able to use these effects.

@TITLE:Generating a short[] using streams
@CONTENT:Building upon Populating a List with a contiguous range of shorts I tried generating an array of primitive shorts. This turned out to be surprisingly harder than expected. Short[] range = IntStream.range(0, 500).mapToObj(value -> (short) value).toArray(Short[]::new) worked but: short[] range = IntStream.range(0, 500).mapToObj(value -> (short) value).toArray(short[]::new) generated a compiler error: method toArray in interface Stream<T> cannot be applied to given types;
  required: IntFunction<A[]>
  found: short[]::new
  reason: inference variable A has incompatible bounds
    equality constraints: short
    upper bounds: Object
  where A,T are type-variables:
    A extends Object declared in method <A>toArray(IntFunction<A[]>)
    T extends Object declared in interface Stream
 This seems to be an intersection of two problems: The primitive Stream APIs do not provide an implementation for shorts. The non-primitive Stream APIs do not seem to provide a mechanism to return a primitive array. Any ideas?
@CODE:Short[] range = IntStream.range(0, 500).mapToObj(value -> (short) value).toArray(Short[]::new) short[] range = IntStream.range(0, 500).mapToObj(value -> (short) value).toArray(short[]::new) method toArray in interface Stream<T> cannot be applied to given types;

@TITLE:Testing postMessage with Jasmine async doesn't work
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Jasmine 2.0 to write unit tests for some logic in an AngularJS app, but the logic is inside an event listener. From the controller:   window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    if (e.data === "sendMessage()") {
      $scope.submit();
    }
  }, false);
 And from the test file:   describe("post message", function() {
    beforeEach(function(done) {
      var controller = createController(controllerParams);
      spyOn($scope, 'submit');
      window.postMessage('sendMessage()', '*');

    });

    it('should submit on a sent message', function (done) {
      expect($scope.submit).toHaveBeenCalled();
      done();
    });
  });
 But the test fails, the spy never being hit. Extra info from putting in console debug statements: window.addEventListener in the controller IS getting called. The beforeEach and it block are both getting called. The above message handler in the controller is not getting called during the test. The message sent in this test is eventually being receievd by the message handler, several times, but not until after the test ends. What is my test missing here?
@CODE:window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {

@TITLE:SQL execution time much slower in a Tomcat Servlet than in a normal Java program
@CONTENT:For inexplicable reasons however, this morning the performance increased for two of my Queries that used to be slow. I have no idea why. I have no authority over the server, maybe someone changed something. The problem is no more. In a nutshell: s.executeQuery(sql) runs extremely slowly within a tomcat servlet on server Same query runs fine without servlet (simple java program) on the same machine Not all queries are slow within the servlet. Only a few bigger ones do Same servlet runs fast on another machine UPDATES Please read the updates below the text ! I have a servlet that executes SQL requests and sends back the results via JSON. For some reason, some requests take a huge amount of time to execute, but when I run them in any Oracle SQL Client, they are executed in no time. I am talking about a difference of 1 second vs 5 minutes for the same SQL (that is not that complex). How can this be explained ? Is there a way to improve the performance of a java based SQL request ? I am using the traditional way of executing queries: java.sql.Connection conn = null;
java.sql.Statement s = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

String dbDriver = "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver";
String dbConnectionString = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@" + dbHost + ":" + dbPort + ":" + dbSid;

Class.forName(dbDriver).newInstance();
conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbConnectionString, dbUser, dbPass);
s = conn.createStatement();
s.setQueryTimeout(9999);
rs = s.executeQuery(newStatement);
ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();

// Get the results
while (rs.next()) {
// collect the results
}

// close connections
 I tried with ojdbc14 and ojdbc6 but there was no difference. UPDATE 1: I tried the same SQL in a local Java project (not a servlet) on my client machine, and I get the results immediately. So I assume the problem is coming from my servlet or the tomcat configuration ? UPDATE 2: The culprit is indeed rs = s.executeQuery(mySql); I tried to use preparedStatement instead, but there is no difference. UPDATE 3: I created a new Servlet running on a local Tomcat and the Query comes back fast. The problem is therefore coming from my production server or Tomcat config. Any ideas what config items could affect this ? UPDATE 4: I tried the same code in a normal java program instead of a servlet (still on the same server) and the results are coming fast. Ergo the problem comes from the Servlet itself (or Tomcat ?). Still don't know what to do, but I narrowed it down :) UPDATE 5: Jstack shows the following (It starts where my servlet is, I cut the rest)     "http-8080-3" daemon prio=3 tid=0x00eabc00 nid=0x2e runnable [0xaa9ee000]

@LINK:/questions/30738584/openpyxl-returning-empty-cell-values-for-formula-series
@TITLE:openpyxl returning empty cell values for formula series
@CONTENT:Vitals: python 3.4.3 | openpyxl 2.2.3 | Excel 2013 Like everyone knows you can use Excel's fill handle to quickly set up a number series down a column [1,2,3,4,5,6,etc] and this works with formula as well [=sum(B1,C1), =sum(B2,C2), =sum(B3,C3), etc]. However when I attempt to use openpyxl to nab formula added using the fill handle in Excel, those cells are reported to be empty. It didn't work with my original code so I created a simple script containing this: for row in ws.rows:
  for cell in row:
    print('my value is:',cell.value)
 And ran it against this tiny (aww) Excel file. I used the fill handle on A1 to populate A2-A5 with formulas. (I'm just showing the formula for clarity, what I actually see in column A are the results.) #      A       B   C
1 =SUM(B1:C1)  1   2
2 =SUM(B2:C2)  10  20
3 =SUM(B3:C3)  20  25
4 =SUM(B4:C4)  90  42
5 =SUM(B5:C5)  64  4
 This was the output in console: my value is: =SUM(B1:C1)
my value is: 1
my value is: 2
my value is: =SUM(B2:C2)
my value is: 10
my value is: 20
my value is: =
my value is: 20
my value is: 25
my value is: =
my value is: 90
my value is: 42
my value is: =
my value is: 64
my value is: 4
 openpyxl reads the formula in A1 and A2 but not A3-A5. I tried this snippet against a couple of simple number series and openpyxl didn't have a problem reading those cells...the issue just seems to be with formulas. Am I missing something obvious?
@CODE:for row in ws.rows:

    print('my value is:',cell.value) #      A       B   C

@TITLE:How to specify which start event should be called from a BPMN callActivity
@CONTENT:From http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/PDF on page 238: If the Process is used as a global Process (a callable Process that can be invoked from Call Activities of other Processes) and there are multiple None Start Events, then when flow is transferred from the parent Process to the global Process, only one of the global Process¡¦s Start Events will be triggered. The targetRef attribute of a Sequence Flow incoming to the Call Activity object can be extended to identify the appropriate Start Event. How does one go about extending the targetRef attribute? Doesn't it have to be a valid IDREF? Maybe they mean the sequenceFlow element should be extended with a custom attribute? Are there any examples of such an extension?

@TITLE:Override Spree Commerce's Bootstrap Variables
@CONTENT:I'm having an issue with deploying a customized _variables.scss to my production server as a compiled asset. Everything is fine on my development environment, it's in production that my variables are being overwritten. I'm using Rails 4.2.1 with Spree 3.0 Stable branch. I have the following structure: Files created in vendor/assets/stylesheets/frontend _variables.scss (my custom app variables) all.css (generated by Spree) frontend_bootstrap.css.scss (override Spree) navbar.scss (my customization) The _variables.scss contains the following: // Place all Sass variables here.

// Colors
$brand-primary: green;
$gray: #aaa;

// Navbar
$navbar-default-bg: #fff;
$navbar-height: 100px;
$navbar-border-radius: 0;
$navbar-default-border: none;
$navbar-default-toggle-hover-bg: $navbar-default-bg;
$navbar-default-toggle-icon-bar-bg: lighten($gray, 60%);
$navbar-default-toggle-border-color: $navbar-default-bg;
$navbar-default-link-active-bg: $brand-primary;
 The frontend_boostrap.css.scss contains the following: // Spree Bootstrap Override

// Core
@import "variables";
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";

// Custom Overrides
@import "navbar";
 The navbar.scss contains the following: // Navbar Customization

.navbar-myapp {
  margin-bottom: 40px;
  border-top: none;
  border-bottom: 1px solid $navbar-default-toggle-icon-bar-bg;

  .navbar-brand {
    padding: 15px;
  }
}
 The Rails standard app/assets/stylesheets/application.css manifest isn't being used/I haven't declared anything specfic in there. The produced HTML head code shows all.css and frontend. <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="/assets/spree/frontend/all.self-33fc4a513acb9a5f3fd4ba26b89c94184e5d028c4bd40eee6736d3ccfea5c140.css?body=1">

 All is well in development but when I deploy this to my test server, some of the variables are being overwritten by the default, this includes the navbar configuration and a color. I'm not sure if this is because of asset compilation order; or if it's how bootstrap-sass is imported. Any suggestion on how I can go about using _variables.scss without it being overwritten? I didn't want any duplication, that's why I wanted to change the navbar and colors in the the variables sass file.

@TITLE:Is JavaScript a Context Free Language?
@CONTENT:This article on how browsers work explains how CSS is context free, while HTML is not. But what about JavaScript, is JavaScript context free? I am learning about CFG and formal proofs, but am a long way away from understanding how to figure this out. Does anyone know if JavaScript is context free or not?

@CONTENT:I modified a huge C++ project with lots of files and functions. The problem is, that now there are tons of useless files, includes, global variables and functions. Removing them by hand would be a pain. Is there a tool that analyzes the code like a compiler does and deletes all unused stuff? I would prefer a tool for unix. Also a way to remove only one or a few of the useless components named above would help.

@TITLE:Is Silent Remote Notifications possible if user has disabled push for the app?
@CONTENT:In my settings tabbar: I have a feature specific switch which can be turned OFF or ON based on API response. From website only admin is authorized to turn ON/OFF. I can make /user API call everytime on settings tap to check the current settings for the user but there are couple of disadvantage like if user is already on setting then it will not update the UI and calling api everytime on settings tap doesn't sounds a perfect solution. I think better solution is to send a silent push notification which i can use to make the API call to update the settings UI whenever needed. But if user has disabled the push notification will I still receive silent push ? What is the recommended approach to handle such situations ?

@TITLE:Polymer 1.0 - paper-ripple goes all over the screen instead fit in the element
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the ripple effect on a clickable list of items but I'm facing the issue that the ripple effect goes all over the screen when I encapsulate that list into a custom element. It works great if I place it in my index.html but fails when I create a custom element that is included there. See an image of the issue: I've been reading similar questions where the answer is to make the container relative, which should be already done. So I'm wondering if it is required to set any special attribute in the host when using the ripple effect from a custom element. My example code is as follow. Index.html <!doctype html>
<html lang="">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="description" content="">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

 When replacing the in the index.html by the section tag content (the section tag included) of my-list.html, the ripple effect works fine. The fit property in the ripple didn't solve the problem either. What am I missing in the custom component?

@TITLE:Remote Debugging with XDebug from inside a Docker Container does not work
@CONTENT:I'm trying to setup a dockered AMP environment and can't get the remote debugger working. My setup is as follows: I have a database container running mysql which is working like a charm. I built a Docker image 'phpmysqli' with the following Dockerfile FROM php:apache

 I call docker run --rm -ti  --name web -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 -v /path/to/projects:/var/www/html --link db:db  phpmysqli
 After this phpinfo respectively php -i shows that xdebug 2.3.2 is up and running. Next I setup a Server inside IntelliJ IDEA called 'Docker' with Host 127.0.0.1, Port 8080 and Debugger Xdebug. I setup the path mapping analogous to the Volume mapping in the docker run statement. In the PHP->Debug settings I checked that I use port 9000 for incoming connections, that I will accept external connections and that I will not ignore connections from unregistered servers. After this I created a new PHP Remote Debug Configuration called Docker, too. Server is Docker, session id is XDEBUG_IDEA. I can call PHP files on the Container, I can connect to the db via the link... but for some reason nothing whatsoever happens when I try to start a debug session. I tried using a cookie (and yes, I set XDEBUG_IDEA as session id in xdebug helper). I tried sending XDEBUG_SESSION_START=XDEBUG_IDEA as GET... Can you smart people out there tell me what I missed?

            android:inputType="text"/>
</android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout>

I don't mean a java callout to the shell through the Process object but a way such that when I run my app, the server starts, and when my app is killed, the server is killed. I can live with an embedded database if such a mode exists, though something that reflects server consistency semantics would be ideal.

@LINK:/questions/30564737/android-orientation-change-different-layout-same-fragments
@TITLE:Android Orientation Change: Different Layout, Same Fragments
@CONTENT:This is pretty much a classic Android use case. Say we have 2 fragments: FragmentA and FragmentB. In landscape mode, FragmentA and FragmentB sit side by side. In portrait mode, they each take up the full screen when in use. (See this image but replace tablet->landscape and handset->portrait) As explained here (Supporting Single-Pane and Multi-Pane Layouts), there are 2 ways to achieve this: 1- Multiple fragments, one activity: Use one activity regardless of the device size, but decide at runtime whether to combine fragments in the layout (to create a multiple-pane design) or swap fragments (to create a single-pane design). 2- Multiple fragments, multiple activities: On a tablet, place multiple fragments in one activity; on a handset, use separate activities to host each fragment. For example, when the tablet design uses two fragments in an activity, use the same activity for handsets, but supply an alternative layout that includes just the first fragment. When running on a handset and you need to switch fragments (such as when the user selects an item), start another activity that hosts the second fragment. This makes a lot of sense in theory, but I'm hitting some hurdles in trying to actually implement either of these approaches in a way that restores the state of the Fragments when the orientation changes and on back button press. I tried the first approach and got quite far, but found it messy because it required managing all the fragment transactions manually, in particular because the container of a Fragment cannot be changed easily. It is also a pain to decide what to do on back pressed because the last transaction on the backstack might belong to the other orientation. Now I am trying the second option. It seems cleaner so far but the Fragments get recreated from scratch on every orientation change (because each orientation uses a different Activity). I would like to have a way to restore the Fragment state from the other Activity/orientation. Can anyone explain how this can be done, or point me to an appropriate tutorial or sample application?

@TITLE:Can't setup VPN connection using Network Extension Framework iOS 8 in Swift
@CONTENT:So I've been trying to use the iOS 8 Network Extension Framework to setup a VPN connection when the users presses a UIButton. I've used the following tutorial: http://ramezanpour.net/post/2014/08/03/configure-and-manage-vpn-connections-programmatically-in-ios-8/ But for some reason it keeps asking for the vpn password and shared secret. Even though I set the passwordReference and sharedSecretReference. And if I enter these details when installing the profile it will still not work. It just doesn't do anything when starting the connection using the framework. When trying to connect using the settings app it gives a "there's no sharedSecret" error. This is the code I use to set up the connection. func toggleConnection(sender: UIButton) {
    if(!self.connected){
        self.manager.loadFromPreferencesWithCompletionHandler { (error) -> Void in
            if((error) != nil) {

@TITLE:openpyxl returning empty cell values for formula series
@CONTENT:Vitals: python 3.4.3 | openpyxl 2.2.3 | Excel 2013 Like everyone knows you can use Excel's fill handle to quickly set up a number series down a column [1,2,3,4,5,6,etc] and this works with formula as well [=sum(B1,C1), =sum(B2,C2), =sum(B3,C3), etc]. However when I attempt to use openpyxl to nab formula added using the fill handle in Excel, those cells are reported to be empty. It didn't work with my original code so I created a simple script containing this: for row in ws.rows:
  for cell in row:
    print('my value is:',cell.value)
 And ran it against this tiny (aww) Excel file. I used the fill handle on A1 to populate A2-A5 with formulas. (I'm just showing the formula for clarity, what I actually see in column A are the results.) #      A       B   C
1 =SUM(B1:C1)  1   2
2 =SUM(B2:C2)  10  20
3 =SUM(B3:C3)  20  25
4 =SUM(B4:C4)  90  42
5 =SUM(B5:C5)  64  4
 This was the output in console: my value is: =SUM(B1:C1)

 openpyxl reads the formula in A1 and A2 but not A3-A5. I tried this snippet against a couple of simple number series and openpyxl didn't have a problem reading those cells...the issue just seems to be with formulas. Am I missing something obvious?

@TITLE:How to specify which start event should be called from a BPMN callActivity
@CONTENT:From http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/PDF on page 238: If the Process is used as a global Process (a callable Process that can be invoked from Call Activities of other Processes) and there are multiple None Start Events, then when flow is transferred from the parent Process to the global Process, only one of the global Process¡¦s Start Events will be triggered. The targetRef attribute of a Sequence Flow incoming to the Call Activity object can be extended to identify the appropriate Start Event. How does one go about extending the targetRef attribute? Doesn't it have to be a valid IDREF? Maybe they mean the sequenceFlow element should be extended with a custom attribute? Are there any examples of such an extension?

 All is well in development but when I deploy this to my test server, some of the variables are being overwritten by the default, this includes the navbar configuration and a color. I'm not sure if this is because of asset compilation order; or if it's how bootstrap-sass is imported. Any suggestion on how I can go about using _variables.scss without it being overwritten? I didn't want any duplication, that's why I wanted to change the navbar and colors in the the variables sass file.

@CONTENT:In my settings tabbar: I have a feature specific switch which can be turned OFF or ON based on API response. From website only admin is authorized to turn ON/OFF. I can make /user API call everytime on settings tap to check the current settings for the user but there are couple of disadvantage like if user is already on setting then it will not update the UI and calling api everytime on settings tap doesn't sounds a perfect solution. I think better solution is to send a silent push notification which i can use to make the API call to update the settings UI whenever needed. But if user has disabled the push notification will I still receive silent push ? What is the recommended approach to handle such situations ?

@TITLE:Polymer 1.0 - paper-ripple goes all over the screen instead fit in the element
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the ripple effect on a clickable list of items but I'm facing the issue that the ripple effect goes all over the screen when I encapsulate that list into a custom element. It works great if I place it in my index.html but fails when I create a custom element that is included there. See an image of the issue: I've been reading similar questions where the answer is to make the container relative, which should be already done. So I'm wondering if it is required to set any special attribute in the host when using the ripple effect from a custom element. My example code is as follow. Index.html <!doctype html>
<html lang="">

 When replacing the in the index.html by the section tag content (the section tag included) of my-list.html, the ripple effect works fine. The fit property in the ripple didn't solve the problem either. What am I missing in the custom component?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to setup a dockered AMP environment and can't get the remote debugger working. My setup is as follows: I have a database container running mysql which is working like a charm. I built a Docker image 'phpmysqli' with the following Dockerfile FROM php:apache

 I call docker run --rm -ti  --name web -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 -v /path/to/projects:/var/www/html --link db:db  phpmysqli
 After this phpinfo respectively php -i shows that xdebug 2.3.2 is up and running. Next I setup a Server inside IntelliJ IDEA called 'Docker' with Host 127.0.0.1, Port 8080 and Debugger Xdebug. I setup the path mapping analogous to the Volume mapping in the docker run statement. In the PHP->Debug settings I checked that I use port 9000 for incoming connections, that I will accept external connections and that I will not ignore connections from unregistered servers. After this I created a new PHP Remote Debug Configuration called Docker, too. Server is Docker, session id is XDEBUG_IDEA. I can call PHP files on the Container, I can connect to the db via the link... but for some reason nothing whatsoever happens when I try to start a debug session. I tried using a cookie (and yes, I set XDEBUG_IDEA as session id in xdebug helper). I tried sending XDEBUG_SESSION_START=XDEBUG_IDEA as GET... Can you smart people out there tell me what I missed?

@TITLE:TextInputLayout hint color
@CONTENT:I'm using new Google design library (com.android.support:design:22.2.0) and I have problem with android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout. If I set its EditText programmatically, floating hint color is gray instead of accent color. It works if user fills field (EditText) itself or if he changes preddefined value of field. This is my code: <android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_width="match_parent">
        <EditText
            android:id="@+id/register_username"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:hint="@string/register_username"
            android:inputType="text"/>
</android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout>
 After user clicks some button it fill field via setText() method of EditText and floating hint becomes gray. Is it bug or I'm missing something?
@CODE:<android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_width="match_parent">
        <EditText

@TITLE:How to launch local DynamoDB programmatically?
@CONTENT:I am able to launch a local DynamoDB server from bash through this command: java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb &
 Is there not a pure-java way to start the server in one's code? I don't mean a java callout to the shell through the Process object but a way such that when I run my app, the server starts, and when my app is killed, the server is killed. I can live with an embedded database if such a mode exists, though something that reflects server consistency semantics would be ideal.

@LINK:/questions/30564737/android-orientation-change-different-layout-same-fragments
@TITLE:Android Orientation Change: Different Layout, Same Fragments
@CONTENT:This is pretty much a classic Android use case. Say we have 2 fragments: FragmentA and FragmentB. In landscape mode, FragmentA and FragmentB sit side by side. In portrait mode, they each take up the full screen when in use. (See this image but replace tablet->landscape and handset->portrait) As explained here (Supporting Single-Pane and Multi-Pane Layouts), there are 2 ways to achieve this: 1- Multiple fragments, one activity: Use one activity regardless of the device size, but decide at runtime whether to combine fragments in the layout (to create a multiple-pane design) or swap fragments (to create a single-pane design). 2- Multiple fragments, multiple activities: On a tablet, place multiple fragments in one activity; on a handset, use separate activities to host each fragment. For example, when the tablet design uses two fragments in an activity, use the same activity for handsets, but supply an alternative layout that includes just the first fragment. When running on a handset and you need to switch fragments (such as when the user selects an item), start another activity that hosts the second fragment. This makes a lot of sense in theory, but I'm hitting some hurdles in trying to actually implement either of these approaches in a way that restores the state of the Fragments when the orientation changes and on back button press. I tried the first approach and got quite far, but found it messy because it required managing all the fragment transactions manually, in particular because the container of a Fragment cannot be changed easily. It is also a pain to decide what to do on back pressed because the last transaction on the backstack might belong to the other orientation. Now I am trying the second option. It seems cleaner so far but the Fragments get recreated from scratch on every orientation change (because each orientation uses a different Activity). I would like to have a way to restore the Fragment state from the other Activity/orientation. Can anyone explain how this can be done, or point me to an appropriate tutorial or sample application?

@TITLE:Can't setup VPN connection using Network Extension Framework iOS 8 in Swift
@CONTENT:So I've been trying to use the iOS 8 Network Extension Framework to setup a VPN connection when the users presses a UIButton. I've used the following tutorial: http://ramezanpour.net/post/2014/08/03/configure-and-manage-vpn-connections-programmatically-in-ios-8/ But for some reason it keeps asking for the vpn password and shared secret. Even though I set the passwordReference and sharedSecretReference. And if I enter these details when installing the profile it will still not work. It just doesn't do anything when starting the connection using the framework. When trying to connect using the settings app it gives a "there's no sharedSecret" error. This is the code I use to set up the connection. func toggleConnection(sender: UIButton) {
    if(!self.connected){
        self.manager.loadFromPreferencesWithCompletionHandler { (error) -> Void in
            if((error) != nil) {
                println("VPN Preferences error: 1")
            }
            else {
                var p = NEVPNProtocolIPSec()
                p.username = "$username"

@TITLE:awk Program File execution
@CONTENT:As my last question was getting to long, here is a condensed version with the current code level. Summary: I need to take in a pipe-delimited input file, check to ensure all applicable record types are present, add any that are missing, and verify/correct the number of subfields within each record type. Input records: AA|1234|ABCD|EDGFT|TR56BE|~BB||E5TGE|~CC|253641|84597|~DD|78HND|ACBE|||43|~EE|HISBL|78943|~FF|12345|SKIP|~GG|||TYBGFR

 Record type and subfield count validation file known_flds entries: AA~5~req
BB~2~opt
CC~3~opt
DD~6~opt
EE~4~opt
FF~2~skp
GG~4~opt
 Current script, without the subfield correction: #!/usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN { FS=OFS="~" }

FNR==NR {
    dflts[$1] = create_empty_field($1,$2)
    if( $3 ~ /req|opt/ ) fld_order[++fld_cnt] = $1
    fld_rule[$1] = $3
    next
}

{
    flds = ""
    j = 1
    for(i=1; i<=fld_cnt; i++) {
        j = skip_flds( j )

        if($j !~ ("^" fld_order[i])) fld = dflts[fld_order[i]]
        else { fld = $j; j++ }
        flds = flds (flds=="" ? "" : OFS) fld
    }
    print flds
}

function create_empty_field(name, cnt,     fld, i) {
    fld = name
    for(i=1; i<=cnt; i++) { fld = fld "|" }
    return( fld )
}

function skip_flds(fnum,     name) {
    name = $fnum
    sub(/\|.*$/, "", name)
    while(fld_rule[name] == "skp") {
        fnum++
        name = $fnum
        sub(/\|.*$/, "", name)
    }
    return( fnum )
}
 My initial attempt at performing the validation and correction of the subfields: #!/usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN { FS=OFS="~" }

FNR==NR {
    dflts[$1] = create_empty_field($1,$2)
    if( $3 ~ /req|opt/ ) fld_order[++fld_cnt] = $1
    fld_rule[$1] = $3
    next
}

{
    flds = ""
    j = 1
    for(i=1; i<=fld_cnt; i++) {
        j = skip_flds( j )
        if($j !~ ("^" fld_order[i])) fld = dflts[fld_order[i]]
        else { fld = fix_sub($j,$2); j++ }
        flds = flds (flds=="" ? "" : OFS) fld
    }
    print flds
}

function create_empty_field(name, cnt,     fld, i) {
    fld = name
    for(i=1; i<=cnt; i++) { fld = fld "|" }
    return( fld )
}

function skip_flds(fnum,     name) {
    name = $fnum
    sub(/\|.*$/, "", name)
    while(fld_rule[name] == "skp") {
        fnum++
        name = $fnum
        sub(/\|.*$/, "", name)
    }
    return( fnum )
}

function fix_sub(rec, num,  upd, cnt) {
    cnt=split(rec,a,"|")-1
    upd=""
    if(cnt != num) 
      {for(i=1;i<=$num;i++) 
       upd = upd a[i] "|" }
    else { upd=$rec }
    return(upd)
}
 The above resulted in errors when it reached the second record type. So now I know that I need to capture the 2nd value from the known_flds file in order to pass that through to the fix_sub function. I will be adding:         sub_fld[$1] = $2
 In the FNR==NRsection, but beyond that, my brain is simply fried and I cannot move forward. I know as a standalone, the fix_sub area works. Now I just need to get the value read from known_flds to pass through. The desired output is: AA|1234|ABCD|EDGFT|TR56BE|~BB||~CC|253641|84597|~DD|78HND|ACBE|||43|~EE|HISBL|78943||~GG|||TYBGFR

@TITLE:Microsoft AlwaysOn failover solution and Delphi
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a Delphi application to work with AlwaysOn solution. I found on Google that I have to use MultiSubnetFailover=True in the connection string. Application is compiled in Delphi XE3 and uses TADOConnection. If I use Provider=SQLOLEDB in the connection string, application starts but it looks like MultiSubnetFailover=True has no effect. If I use Provider=SQLNCLI11 (I found on Google that OLEDB doesn't support AlwaysOn solution and I have to use SQL Native client) I get invalid attribute when trying to open the connection. The connection string is: Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Password="password here";Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Initial Catalog="DB here";Data Source="SQL Instance here";MultiSubnetFailover=True
 Do I have to upgrade to a newer version on Delphi to use this failover solution or is something that I'm missing in the connection string?

I'm a bit lost with this so I'm following some tutorials to implement things like Toolbar, Navigation Drawer, etc. I have to say that I'm doing it providing compatibility to pre-lollipop android versions, so I'm using support libraries. What concers to my question, is that I have just implemented the Navigation Drawer following one of this tutorials and using the following libraries for compatibility: support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout
support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
 I think that the code implementation is too long to put it here, so I'll provide the link to this tutorial, I have done it exactly as is said here. My problem is that, when I select one item from the navigation drawer's row, it perfectly opens it correspondant frament, but, it doesn't show any ripple effect, or simply any touch effect, when touching it. Something like this: I have taken a look to some other tutorials, for example, to the one to which belongs the attached gif, to see if they use any method or implementation to provide that efect to the touch, but nothing is implemented to get that effect, just the onclick method. So, what's wrong with this code, and how could I modify it, or what could I add to get that effect?

@TITLE:Regular expression validating PAN card number
@CONTENT:I have seen this question and this blog for the PAN regex. [A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1}. But my question is a little bit more extended than that. In a PAN card number: 1) The first three letters are sequence of alphabets from AAA to zzz
2) The fourth character informs about the type of holder of the Card. Each assesse is unique:`

    C ¡X Company
    P ¡X Person
    H ¡X HUF(Hindu Undivided Family)
    F ¡X Firm
    A ¡X Association of Persons (AOP)
    T ¡X AOP (Trust)
    B ¡X Body of Individuals (BOI)
    L ¡X Local Authority
    J ¡X Artificial Judicial Person
    G ¡X Government


3) The fifth character of the PAN is the first character
    (a) of the surname / last name of the person, in the case of 
a "Personal" PAN card, where the fourth character is "P" or
    (b) of the name of the Entity/ Trust/ Society/ Organisation
in the case of Company/ HUF/ Firm/ AOP/ BOI/ Local Authority/ Artificial Jurdical Person/ Govt,
where the fourth character is "C","H","F","A","T","B","L","J","G".

4) The last character is a alphabetic check digit.
 I want the regex to be checking on the basis of that. Since I get Name of the person, or the Organization in another EditText, I needed to further verify the 4th and 5th letter. It turns out to be [A-Z]{3}[C,H,F,A,T,B,L,J,G,P]{1}**something for the fifth character**[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1} I'm not able to figure out how that something has to be written. Programmatically, it can be done, someone has done it in rails but can it be done through regex? How?

Each has the following format and nothing else (example): 03 A0 15 B7 ... At the moment I am not getting any syntax errors however I had to define three registers each having 50x50 = 2500 bits and it is compiling quite slower, and I am getting "Timing requirements are not met" warning. When I want to use a file with better resolution (640x480 would be great but its off limits, it seems) it is significantly lot worse. It took 15 minutes to get 200x200 pixel image and .sof file is around 6MB. Isn't there a way to use readmemh for large inputs? that is what I did to read ...
reg [7:0] mem_R[0:2499];
reg [7:0] mem_G[0:2499];
reg [7:0] mem_B[0:2499];

initial begin

...

$readmemh("menuR.txt", mem_R);
$readmemh("menuG.txt", mem_G);
$readmemh("menuB.txt", mem_B);

end
 and I access it as follows if( mem_R[total_current-127510] > 0)
begin
menu_red   = 1;
end
@CODE:...
reg [7:0] mem_R[0:2499];
reg [7:0] mem_G[0:2499];
reg [7:0] mem_B[0:2499];

initial begin

...

$readmemh("menuR.txt", mem_R);
$readmemh("menuG.txt", mem_G);
$readmemh("menuB.txt", mem_B);

end if( mem_R[total_current-127510] > 0)
begin
menu_red   = 1;
end Ex: Set(0, 6) to color 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

@TITLE:Parsing nested key value pairs in Boost Spirit
@CONTENT:I am having trouble writing what I think should be a simple parser using Boost::Spirit. (I'm using Spirit instead of just using string functions as this is partly a learning exercise for me). Data The data to parse takes the form of key value pairs, where a value can itself be a key value pair. Keys are alphanumeric (with underscores and no digit as first character); values are alphanumeric plus .-_ - the values can be dates in the format DD-MMM-YYYY e.g. 01-Jan-2015 and floating point numbers like 3.1415 in addition to plain old alphanumeric strings. Keys and values are separated with =; pairs are separated with ;; structured values are delimited with {...}. At the moment I am erasing all spaces from the user input before passing it to Spirit. Example input: Key1 = Value1; Key2 = { NestedKey1=Alan; NestedKey2 = 43.1232; }; Key3 = 15-Jul-1974 ; I would then strip all spaces to give Key1=Value1;Key2={NestedKey1=Alan;NestedKey2=43.1232;};Key3=15-Jul-1974; and then I actually pass it to Spirit. Problem What I currently have works just dandy when values are simply values. When I start encoding structured values in the input then Spirit stops after the first structured value. A workaround if there is only one structured value is to put it at the end of the input... but I will need two or more structured values on occasion.

 I'm not sure if the problem is down to my ignorance of BNF, my ignorance of Spirit, or perhaps my ignorance of both at this point. Any help appreciated. I've read e.g. Spirit Qi sequence parsing issues and links therein but I still can't figure out what I am doing wrong.

@TITLE:Visual Studio 2015, Nuget and ¡§same key has already been added.¡¨
@CONTENT:I have Visual Studio 2015 RC. When I open a console app or a Windows Phone 8 Silverlight project, everything works fine, I can use Nuget without problems. When I open a Universal App project (Windows 8.1 + Windows Phone 8.1), Nuget breaks. When I open the Nuget console, I see When I try to install a Nuget package using the Nuget GUI, I get the same error. One more strange thing. When I open VS2015 RC without any projects and open the Nuget console, I do not get the error. Then when I open my Universal App project, the error appears. I am pretty sure it is connected to the Universal App project. I testes the Universal App project in VS2013 and everything works fine there, no problems with Nuget. I tried all the steps in installing nuget package "same key has already been added." but it did not help. I guess it is because another folder may be corrupted in my case. Happens to me on two separate machines, both run Windows 8.1 Pro, one has only VS2015 RC and on has both VS2013 Pro and VS2015 Pro.

Partition table entries are not in disk order.
 As you see, the resize2fs does not have effect. I also cannot create a swap partition with more space than 1M. This problem occurs on all my instances. Although they all have 30-35GB EBS volumes, I cannot resize them and they stay at 8GB. When I attach just an additional volume besides the root mounted one, it works fine. Can you help me?

(every thing is ok here) Now I need to to get the lines of that "textblock" according to the previous specified properties. I mean I need the lines that TextWrapping algorithms will result. In other words, I need each line in separated string or I need a one string with Scape Sequence "\n". Any Idea to do that ??

@TITLE:Close opened pop-up window on form submission and trigger click on the parent window
@CONTENT:I have a parent window from where I am opening a pop-up window using window.open() and I am monitoring the return of that pop-up window using the window.opener method. I have two queries here: On my pop-up window, there is a submit button that takes care of the submit functionality of the form and I would like to wait for the submit to complete and close this pop-up window on submission. When the form is submitted and the pop-up window is closed, I am fetching one of the text box values and using that in my parent window to simulate a search automatically as soon as the pop-up window is closed. Code: // parent window handling of information returned from the pop-up window
function HandlePopupResult(value) {
    alert("The field value is: " + value);
    $("input[value='Search']").trigger("click");
}

//pop-up window handling of information to be returned to the parent window on submission
$("#myForm").submit(function() {
    window.opener.HandlePopupResult($("#field").val());
    window.close();
});
 So my question is: How can I make sure that the submit is completed in order for me to trigger a search click in my parent window and close this pop-up window? Kindly let me know. I am able to finally send information back to my parent form properly but I just need to make sure that my submit gets completed. Any suggestions on making sure that I fire my events only after the submit is successful? Cheers.

@TITLE:How to close/retry/manage a WebSocket using Koush AndroidAsync?
@CONTENT:I'm using Koush's AndroidAsync for a WebSocket client. My code follows the example at https://github.com/koush/AndroidAsync and works. (Example copied below.) I need my app to open a websocket when it starts, however, I need to handle a few issues: A) I need to allow the user to change the address of the websocket server. In this case, I need to close the existing websocket (which may have failed) and open a websocket to the new server. B) The Server may be down or unavailable. In this case I'd like to report that back to the activity. Currently it simply silently fails. So in order of importance: How do I close the websocket? How do I efficiently open a websocket to a new address? (Can I just reuse my AsyncHttpClient?) How do I retry on a failed or lost connection? How do I provide notification that the connection failed/closed? If this is documented somewhere please let me know. Example code from the website copied below: AsyncHttpClient.getDefaultInstance().websocket(get,"my-protocol",new WebSocketConnectCallback(){

@CONTENT:According to this isuue issue and this answered question it is not possible to simply define a trait alias like: trait Alias = Foo + Bar;
 The workaround is a bit ugly: trait Alias : Foo + Bar {}
impl<T: Foo + Bar> Alias for T {}
 Therefore I want to define a macro for this. I tried macro_rules! trait_alias {
    ( $name : ident, $base : expr ) => {

        impl<T: $base> $name for T {}

trait Foo {}
trait Bar {}

trait_alias!(Alias, Foo + Bar);
 But it fails with error: src\main.rs:5:17: 5:22 error: expected one of `?`, `where`, or `{`, found `Foo + Bar`

 Probably Foo + Bar is not an expression. I tried several other variations but with no luck. Is it possible to define such a macro? How should it look like?

@LINK:/questions/30188387/using-a-decorator-to-get-list-of-implemented-interfaces
@TITLE:Using a Decorator to get list of implemented interfaces
@CONTENT:Do you know if it is possible to get the array of interfaces implemented by a class using a decorator: interface IWarrior {
  // ...
}

interface INinja {
  // ...
}
 So If I do something like: @somedecorator
class Ninja implements INinja, IWarrior {
 // ...
}
 At run-time Ninja will have an annotation which contains ["INinja", "IWarrior"] ? Thanks Update My understanding is that it may be possible to achieve this without having to manually pass the interfaces as strings to the decorator (like in @max-brodin's answer) @interfaces(["INinja", "IWarrior"])
class Ninja implements INinja, IWarrior {

}
 Some of the early decorator proposals allowed the following decorators: List of supported decorators @type ¡V The serialized form of the type of the decorator target @returnType ¡V The serialized form of the return type of the decorator target if it is a function type, undefined otherwise @parameterTypes ¡V A list of serialized types of the decorator target¡¦s arguments if it is a function type, undefined otherwise @name ¡V The name of the decorator target But after some problems the TypeScript team decided to use another approach: Reflect.metadata. The other option was to put it on call sites, which adds a lot of work on the decorator users instead of authors. So we went back to the drawing board and landed on the Reflect.metadata approach instead. I have found an example that allows to identify the types of the parameters of a class constructor. If a developer uses Aurelia's inject decorator, then it will trigger the compiler to generate the metadata: @inject
class Foo {
    constructor(a: A, b: B) {}
}

@inject
class Bar {
    constructor(a: number, b: B) {}
}
 Apparently it is possible to create a decorator and use the --emitDecoratorMetadata flag to generate this kind of metadata. The --emitDecoratorMetadata experimental flag is currently an opt-in feature and only adds metadata to decorated entities. reflect.metadata('desing:paramtypes', [A, B])      // for Foo
reflect.metadata('desing:paramtypes', [Number, B]) // for Bar
 I assume that we can use the reflection API to access all the metadata from the "list of supported decorators" above (@type @returnType @parameterTypes & @name). The only parameter that may contain the information that i'm looking for (the interfaces) is @type but I have not been able to do it myself or find answers in the internet. Update 2 In case it might help somebody in the future. There are plans to add support for complex types (Including interfaces) metadata to TypeScript in the future: /** 
  * Basic shape for a type.
  */
interface _Type {
  /** 
    * Describes the specific shape of the type.
    * @remarks

@LINK:/questions/30178954/dynamic-data-point-label-positioning-in-ggmap
@TITLE:Dynamic data point label Positioning in ggmap
@CONTENT:I'm working with the ggmap package in R and I am relatively new to geospatial data visualizations. I have a data frame of eleven latitude and longitude pairs that I would like to plot on a map, each with a label. Here is the dummy data: lat<- c(47.597157,47.656322,47.685928,47.752365,47.689297,47.628128,47.627071,47.586349,47.512684,47.571232,47.562283)

lon<-c(-122.312187,-122.318039,-122.31472,-122.345345,-122.377045,-122.370117,-122.368462,-122.331734,-122.294395,-122.33606,-122.379745)

labels<-c("Site 1A","Site 1B","Site 1C","Site 2A","Site 3A","Site 1D","Site 2C","Site 1E","Site 2B","Site 1G","Site 2G")

df<-data.frame(lat,lon,labels)
 Now I use annotate to create the data point labels and plot these on a map; map.data <- get_map(location = c(lon=-122.3485,lat=47.6200), 
                    maptype = 'roadmap', zoom = 11)

pointLabels<-annotate("text",x=uniqueReach$lon,y=c(uniqueReach$lat),size=5,font=3,fontface="bold",family="Helvetica",label=as.vector(uniqueReach$label))

dataPlot <- ggmap(map.data) +
 geom_point(data = uniqueReach,aes(x = df$lon, y = df$lat), alpha = 1,fill="red",pch=21,size = 6) + labs(x = 'Longitude', y = 'Latitude')+pointLabels
 This produces a plot of the data points As you can see, there are two data points that overlap around (-122.44,47.63), and their labels also overlap. Now I can manually add a shift to each label point to keep the labels from overlapping (see this post), but this is not a great technique when I need to produce many of these plots for different sets of latitude and longitude pairs. Is there a way I can automatically keep data labels from overlapping? I realize whether the labels overlap is dependent on the actual figure size, so I'm open to fixing the figure size at certain dimensions if need be. Thank you in advance for any insights! EDIT The following is modified code using the answer given by Sandy Mupratt # Defining function to draw text boxes
draw.rects.modified <- function(d,...){
  if(is.null(d$box.color))d$box.color <- NA
  if(is.null(d$fill))d$fill <- "grey95"
  for(i in 1:nrow(d)){
    with(d[i,],{
      grid.rect(gp = gpar(col = box.color, fill = fill,alpha=0.7),
                vp = viewport(x, y, w, h, "cm", c(hjust, vjust=0.25), angle=rot))
    })
  }
  d
}


# Defining function to determine text box borders
enlarge.box.modified <- function(d,...){
  if(!"h"%in%names(d))stop("need to have already calculated height and width.")
  calc.borders(within(d,{
    w <- 0.9*w
    h <- 1.1*h
  }))
}
 Generating the plot: dataplot<-ggmap(map.data) + 
                 geom_point(data = df,aes(x = df$lon, y = df$lat), 
                            alpha = 1, fill = "red", pch = 21, size = 6) + 
                  labs(x = 'Longitude', y = 'Latitude') +
                  geom_dl(data = df, 
                      aes(label = labels), 
                      list(dl.trans(y = y + 0.3), "boxes", cex = .8, fontface = "bold"))
 This is a MUCH more readable plot, but with one outstanding issue. You'll note that the label "Site 1E" begins to overlap the data point associated with "Site 1A". Does directlabels have a way with dealing with labels overlapping data points belonging to another label? A final question I have regarding this is how can I plot several duplicate labels using this method. Suppose the labels for data.frame are all the same: df$labels<-rep("test",dim(df)[1])
 When I use the same code, directlabels removes the duplicate label names: But I want each data point to have a label of "test". Any suggestions?

@TITLE:Why do numbers in a string become ¡§x0n¡¨ when a backslash precedes them?
@CONTENT:I was doing a few experiments with escape backslashes in the Python 3.4 shell and noticed something quite strange. >>> string = "\test\test\1\2\3"
>>> string
'\test\test\x01\x02\x03'
>>> string = "5"
>>> string
'5'
>>> string = "5\6\7"
>>> string
'5\x06\x07'
 As you can see in the above code, I defined a variable string as "\test\test\1\2\3". However, when I entered string in the console, instead of printing "\test\test\1\2\3", it printed "\test\test\x01\x02\x03". Why does this occur, and what is it used for?
@CODE:>>> string = "\test\test\1\2\3"
>>> string
'\test\test\x01\x02\x03'
>>> string = "5"
>>> string
'5'
>>> string = "5\6\7"
>>> string

 If the status = bad then build out num to 50 and impute 0 in the value. So for id 'b' and 'c', I'd produce 44 and 43 additional rows, numbered sequentially in num, respectively. And the value for those new rows would be 0... Any and all help is much appreciated.

@TITLE:UITableView powered by FetchedResultsController with UITableViewAutomaticDimension - Cells move when table is reloaded
@CONTENT:Current set up: TableView with automatically calculated heights: self.tableView.sectionHeaderHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension;
self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension;
self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 152.0;
self.tableView.estimatedSectionHeaderHeight = 50.0;
 Whenever the fetched results controller updates its data the tableview is reloaded:  - (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller {
    [self.tableView reloadData]; 
}
 The cell is configured using a Xib. The first label is pinned to the top of the cell, each following label is pinned to the top of the label above it and the label at the bottom is pinned to the bottom of the cell. The Issue: Each time i set a "Favourite" property on an item in the table view, the fetched results controller is fired to reload the table and the scroll position is changed. It is this change in the scroll position that i am trying to fix. Additional Info If i use fixed cell heights it resolves the issue BUT i require UITableViewAutomaticDimension because the first label can wrap over two lines and the remaining labels may or may not be present. Example Note - As i select the Fav button it sets the fav property in Core data and reloads the table. Why is the table jumping around?
@CODE:self.tableView.sectionHeaderHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension;

I've tried implementing a custom ErrorController, but that doesn't seem to work.

@LINK:/questions/30089084/android-issue-with-implementing-flings-in-nestedscrollview
@TITLE:Android issue with implementing flings in NestedScrollView
@CONTENT:I'm having a bit of an issue using NestedScrollView. My use case uses 2 NestedScrollView, a parent and a child. I have overridden the parent's onNestedPreScroll method to sometimes consume scroll pixels before the child: @Override
public void onNestedPreScroll(View target, int dx, int dy, int[] consumed) {
    if (dy > 0 && getScrollY() < getScrollRange()) {
        int oldScrollY = getScrollY();
        scrollBy(0, dy);
        consumed[1] = getScrollY() - oldScrollY;
    }
}
 I have also overridden the parent's onNestedPreFling to consume fling before the child: @Override
public boolean onNestedPreFling(View target, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
    if (velocityY > 0 && getScrollY() < getScrollRange()) {
        fling((int) velocityY);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
 However, I noticed that when the parent consumes the entirety of a scroll in onNestedPreScroll, the parent's onNestedPreFling is not being called. From my investigation, it appears that if the parent consumes the entire scroll, the child reacts as if an ACTION_MOVE event with deltaY=0 has occurred. This causes the absolute value deltaY to be less than mTouchSlop and mIsBeingDragged would remain being set to false. Since mTouchSlop is false, no fling calculation is made when an ACTION_UP event occurs in the child. Is there a different approach I could be using to get the fling velocity for the parent NestedScrollView? NestedScrollView: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/NestedScrollView.html
@CODE:NestedScrollView NestedScrollView onNestedPreScroll @Override

        scrollBy(0, dy);
        consumed[1] = getScrollY() - oldScrollY;
    }
} onNestedPreFling @Override

    if (velocityY > 0 && getScrollY() < getScrollRange()) {

        return true;

@TITLE:Flatten Observable<Observable<Cursor>> to Observable<Cursor>
@CONTENT:I've an Observable that returns a single Cursor instance (Observable<Cursor>). I'm trying to utilize ContentObservable.fromCursor to obtain every cursor's row in onNext callback. One of the solutions I've figured out is such construction: ContentObservable.fromCursor(cursorObservable.toBlocking().first())
    .subscribe(cursor -> {
        // map to object 
        // add to outer collection
    }, e -> {}, () -> { 
        // do something with list of objects (outer collection)
    });
 This looks rather like a hack because of toBlocking().first(), but it works. I don't like it because most of the processing is done in onNext callback and we've to create outer collection to hold the intermediate results. I wanted to use it like this: cursorObservable.map(ContentObservable::fromCursor)
    .map(fromCursor -> fromCursor.toBlocking().first())
    .map(/* map to object */)
    .toList()
    .subscribe(objects -> {
        // do something with list of objects
    }
 This still utilizes toBlocking().first() and doesn't work because once the fromCursor observable has finished the cursor is closed so there's no way to map it to object. Is there a better way to flatten Observable<Observable<Cursor>> to Observable<Cursor>?
@CODE:Observable Cursor Observable<Cursor> ContentObservable.fromCursor onNext ContentObservable.fromCursor(cursorObservable.toBlocking().first())
    .subscribe(cursor -> {
        // map to object 
        // add to outer collection
    }, e -> {}, () -> { 
        // do something with list of objects (outer collection)
    }); toBlocking().first() onNext cursorObservable.map(ContentObservable::fromCursor)
    .map(fromCursor -> fromCursor.toBlocking().first())
    .map(/* map to object */)
    .toList()

@QREC:30072281
@LINK:/questions/30072281/using-go-on-existing-c-project
@TITLE:Using Go on existing C project
@CONTENT:I have a program entirely written in C that uses multiple object (.o) files in it. These files are all packed inside an archive file (.a) which, in turn, is used at compile-time of the program's main (.c) file. I want to write a new file for this project in Go. My idea is to write this .go file and then create an object (.o) file from it. Afterwards, I want to put this object file inside the already mentioned archive (.a) file. This basically means that I want to call Go functions from a C program. I've read this question, and while it showed me that what I want is possible via GCCGO, it's not 100% clear as to how to do it. Even with the most basic of tests, I get errors during the linking phase. More specifically, here's one of such basic example: printString.go package main

import
(
    "fmt"
)

func PrintString(buff string) int {
    fmt.Printf(buff)
    return 1
}
 c_caller.c #define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>

extern int PrintString(char*) __asm__ ("print.main.PrintString");

int main() {
    char *string_to_pass= NULL;
    asprintf(&string_to_pass, "This is a test.");

    int result= PrintString(string_to_pass);
    if(result) {printf("Everything went as expected!\n");}
    else       {printf("Uh oh, something went wrong!\n");}

    return result;
}
 Compiling In order to compile the Go file, I used this command: gccgo -c printString.go -o printString.o -fgo-prefix=print -Wall -Werror -march=native
 In order to compile the entire thing, I used this command: gccgo -o main c_caller.c printString.o -Wall -Werror -march=native
 The return message I'm getting is: /usr/lib64/libgo.so.4.0.0: undefined reference to `main.main'
/usr/lib64/libgo.so.4.0.0: undefined reference to `__go_init_main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 Which means that GCCGO's expecting a main function in the Go file instead of the C one. Using the --static-libgo, -static and -Wl,-R,/path/to/libgo.so's_folder options on the second command yield a different result: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgo
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 Which makes no sense, since I have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable properly pointing to libgo.so's folder. I realize that I'm probably doing something wrong here, but I just can't see what that is. There's next to no examples of GCCGO and its interaction with C out there, and the only reference I could find was this page, which I personally feel like it's not enough. I ask kindly for some advice on this matter and thank you for your time. :)

@TITLE:Side effects from Chartjs for only *some* clients
@CONTENT:I was working on a couple of Chart.js charts and have found some strange behavior. In this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/h42tv3xv/ people have been getting a variety of side effects when pressing the buttons "Day", "Week", or "Month". What it should do: Simply refresh the chart with potentially new information displayed(the pie and doughnut actually don't have anything new) What it should not do: As a side effect for some, it is growing the size of the <canvas> on each click. It does it for me. But it doesn't do it for a lot of other people accessing this fiddle. Here is a screen shot: Why is it doing this for some people and not others? How can I remedy this problem? If you are curious, I initially asked a question about something else about these charts, but this could be somewhat related. Any clue what could be causing this in my browser and other browsers/computers? Edit, I realize the fiddle is large, so this is what I am doing essentially: // Assign and Create all canvas contexts 
    var ctx = $("#graph1").get(0).getContext("2d");
    var ctx2 =  $("#graph2").get(0).getContext("2d");
    var ctx3 =  $("#graph3").get(0).getContext("2d");

// Instantiate new charts and pass in generated data
    var myChart = new Chart(ctx).Line(graph1Generator("day"));
    var myDoughnutChart = new Chart(ctx2).Doughnut(graph2Generator("day"));
    var myPieChart = new Chart(ctx3).Pie(graph3Generator("day"));
 then I am adding (for each button) an event listener that destroys each canvas, and creates a new one with new information. Here is an example of the "week" button: weekButton.addEventListener("click", function(){

    myChart.destroy();
    myChart = new Chart(ctx).Line(graph2Generator("Week"));

    myDoughnutChart.destroy();
    myDoughnutChart = new Chart(ctx2).Doughnut(graph2Generator("week"));

    myPieChart.destroy();
    myPieChart = new Chart(ctx3).Pie(graph3Generator("week"));


});
@CODE:<canvas> // Assign and Create all canvas contexts

@TITLE:Is this a secure way to prevent Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks?
@CONTENT:Our app is thus: Every user must login login page posts back to server and if an authorized user a SPA app is returned. SPA app is totally AJAX HTTPS Normally we would send a sessionid cookie and a csrftoken cookie. The token cookie value would get included as an x-header on any AJAX posts and everything verified on the server on each request. As the SPA page is built before returning it to the browser we can embed whatever we like in it. We'd like the end user to be able to log in on multiple tabs, with one not affecting the others. What we would rather do: send the sessionid as a cookie, like before, but the cookie name would be random. no csrftoken, but instead embed the random cookie name in the javascript routine that added the x-header to the AJAX post requests. the server would get the sessionid from the x-header. This gives us the opportunity to allow multiple logons, with each logon having a unique sessionid cookie name, but every post request having a standardized x-header name. Would this be as safe as the sessionid cookie, csrftoken cookie/x-header method?

@TITLE:Why is filtering by primality in an inifinite stream of numbers taking forever if processed in parallel?
@CONTENT:I'm creating an infinite stream of Integers starting at 200 Million, filter this stream using a naive primality test implementation to generate load and limit the result to 10. Predicate<Integer> isPrime = new Predicate<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public boolean test(Integer n) {
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;   
        }
        return true;
    }
};

Stream.iterate(200_000_000, n -> ++n)
    .filter(isPrime)
    .limit(10)
    .forEach(i -> System.out.print(i + " "));
 This works as expected. Now, if I add a call to parallel() before filtering, nothing is produced and the processing does not complete. Stream.iterate(200_000_000, n -> ++n)
    .parallel()
    .filter(isPrime)
    .limit(10)
    .forEach(i -> System.out.print(i + " "));
 Can someone point me in the right direction of what's happening here? EDIT: I am not looking for better primality test implementations (it is intended to be a long running implementation) but for an explanation of the negative impact of using a parallel stream.
@CODE:Predicate<Integer> isPrime = new Predicate<Integer>() {

@TITLE:How to hide a Gtk+ FileChooserDialog in Python 3.4?
@CONTENT:I have a program set up so that it displays a FileChooserDialog all by itself (no main Gtk window, just the dialog). The problem I'm having is that the dialog doesn't disappear, even after the user has selected the file and the program has seemingly continued executing. Here's a snippet that showcases this issue: from gi.repository import Gtk

class FileChooser():

    def __init__(self):

        global path

        dia = Gtk.FileChooserDialog("Please choose a file", None,
            Gtk.FileChooserAction.OPEN,
            (Gtk.STOCK_CANCEL, Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL,
             Gtk.STOCK_OPEN, Gtk.ResponseType.OK))

        self.add_filters(dia)

        response = dia.run()

        if response == Gtk.ResponseType.OK:
            print("Open clicked")
            print("File selected: " + dia.get_filename())
            path = dia.get_filename()
        elif response == Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL:
            print("Cancel clicked")

        dia.destroy()

    def add_filters(self, dia):
        filter_any = Gtk.FileFilter()
        filter_any.set_name("Any files")
        filter_any.add_pattern("*")
        dia.add_filter(filter_any)

dialog = FileChooser()

print(path)

input()
quit()
 The dialog only disappears when the program exits with the quit() function call. I've also tried dia.hide(), but that doesn't work either - the dialog is still visible while code continues running. What would the proper way to make the dialog disappear? EDIT: I've since learned that it's discouraged to make a Gtk dialog without a parent window. However, I don't want to deal with having to have the user close a window that has nothing in it and simply stands as the parent for the dialog. Is there a way to make an invisible parent window and then quit the Gtk main loop when the dialog disappears?
@CODE:from gi.repository import Gtk

@TITLE:UOW and Repository Pattern in EF5
@CONTENT:This is about some confusion I have about some of the entity framework material I have found from here: https://www.asp.net/ On this Page it explains how to wrap a dbcontext using a repository and to wrap a repository using a a unit of work class: http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application However, on this page it states that a dbcontext is already a combination of both the UOW pattern and the repository pattern: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext(v=vs.103).aspx So if the problem that these patterns solve are already solved by dbcontext, why re-implement these patterns with EF5? Also, in the tutorial, the UnitOfWork class doesn't seem to show any benefit that UOW is supposed to give. for instance it states: "That way, when a unit of work is complete you can call the SaveChanges method on that instance of the context and be assured that all related changes will be coordinated. " but all it seems to do is wrap the dbcontext for no reason. I think I am missing something. I don't see any co-ordination in this implementation... And how do thing "rollback" if something goes wrong?

 Sails v 0.11, Waterlock v 0.1.0 How can I register user now? UPDATE: This happens due to register action is not yet implemented in waterlock-local-auth module I use for authentication.

@TITLE:SSE intrinsics: Convert 32-bit floats to UNSIGNED 8-bit integers
@CONTENT:Using SSE intrinsics, I've gotten a vector of four 32-bit floats clamped to the range 0-255 and rounded to nearest integer. I'd now like to write those four out as bytes. There is an intrinsic _mm_cvtps_pi8 that will convert 32-bit to 8-bit signed int, but the problem there is that any value over 127 gets clamped to 127. I can't find any instructions that will clamp to unsigned 8-bit values. I have an intuition that what I may want to do is some combination of _mm_cvtps_pi16 and _mm_shuffle_pi8 followed by move instruction to get the four bytes I care about into memory. Is that the best way to do it? I'm going to see if I can figure out how to encode the shuffle control mask. UPDATE: The following appears to do exactly what I want. Is there a better way? #include <tmmintrin.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char out[8];
unsigned char shuf[8] = { 0, 2, 4, 6, 128, 128, 128, 128 };
float ins[4] = {500, 0, 120, 240};

int main()
{
    __m128 x = _mm_load_ps(ins);    // Load the floats
    __m64 y = _mm_cvtps_pi16(x);    // Convert them to 16-bit ints
    __m64 sh = *(__m64*)shuf;       // Get the shuffle mask into a register
    y = _mm_shuffle_pi8(y, sh);     // Shuffle the lower byte of each into the first four bytes
    *(int*)out = _mm_cvtsi64_si32(y); // Store the lower 32 bits

@TITLE:Python Anaconda: how to test if updated libraries are compatible with my existing code?
@CONTENT:I am using a Python 2.7 Anaconda installation on a Windows 7 machine for data analysis and scientific computing. When new libraries are released (e.g. a new version of pandas, patsy, etc), how would you recommend I test the compatibility of the new version with my existing code? Is it possible to have two Anaconda installations on the same machine? Would you recommend some kind of virtual environment? Is there an easy way to roll back to previous versions of a library with Anaconda? I ask because have spent the best part of the last week trying to figure out why my previous code no longer works with the new versions of pandas and patsy. No need to comment how mad I am because of this... Incidentally, this also goes to show that Python is a potentially interesting language for data analysis and scientific computing, but only potentially. The main libraries are too unstable and immature. Pandas was released about 3 1/2 years ago and we're still very far from a v 1.0, so I'm not hopeful that things will get better with time. Imagine if every new release of Matlab required a major rewrite of all your code: Mathworks would have gone out of business long ago!

@LINK:/questions/29833494/pymc-estimating-population-parameters-where-each-observation-is-the-sum-of-two
@TITLE:PyMC: Estimating population parameters where each observation is the sum of two Weibull-distributed variables
@CONTENT:I have a list of n observations, each of which is the sum of two Weibull-distributed variables: x[i] = t1[i] + t2[i]
t1[i] ~ Weibull(shape1, scale1)
t2[i] ~ Weibull(shape2, scale2)
 My goal is: 1) Estimate the shape and scale parameters for both Weibull distributions (shape1, scale1, shape2, scale2), 2) For each observation x[i], estimate t1[i] (and t2[i] follows from this). (Aside: Each observation x[i] is the age of cancer diagnosis, and t1[i] and t2[i] are two different time periods in the development of the tumor. The actual model involves mutation data as well, but before I try that out, I want to make sure that I can use PyMC for this simpler problem.) I am using PyMC2 to make these estimates, and it looks like the run converges, but to incorrect results. I do not know whether there is a problem with my PyMC model syntax, with the MCMC settings, or both. I tried adapting this advice on using Potentials to model latent variables. First I define x[i] and t1[i] for each observation: for i in xrange(n):
    x[i] = pm.Index('x_%i'%i, x=data, index=i) # data is a list of observations
    t1[i] = pm.Weibull('t1_%i'%i, alpha=shape1, beta=scale1)
    # Ensure that initial guess for t1 is not more than the observed sum:
    if t1[i].value >= x[i].value:
        t1[i].value = 0.95 * x[i].value
 Then I define a Deterministic for t2[i] = x[i] - t1[i]: for i in xrange(n):
    def subtractfunc(t1=t1, x=x, ii=i):
        return x[ii] - t1[ii]
    t2[i] = pm.Lambda('t2_%i'%i, subtractfunc)
 And last I define the Potential for t2[i]: t2dist = np.empty(n, dtype=object)
for i in xrange(n):
    def weibfunc(t2=t2, shape2=shape2, scale2=scale2, ii=i):
        return pm.weibull_like(t2[ii], alpha=shape2, beta=scale2)
    t2dist[i] = pm.Potential(logp = weibfunc,
                               name = 't2dist_%i'%i,
                               parents = {'shape2':shape2, 'scale2':scale2, 't2':t2},
                               doc = 'weibull potential for t2',
                               verbose = 0,
                               cache_depth = 2)
 You can see my full code here. I test by simulating 60 independent observations, with shape1 = 1, scale1 = 30, shape2 = 6.5, scale2 = 10, and I run 1e5 iterations of AdaptiveMetropolis. The results converge to a mean of shape1=1.94, scale1=37.9, shape2=0.55, scale2=36.1, and the 95% HPDs do not include the true values. This resulting distribution is not even in the right ballpark, as this histogram shows. (Blue shows the simulated data x[i] that I used, while the red shows the completely different inferred distribution from a representative iteration in the MCMC run.) Running again with a different random seed, I get shape1=4.65, scale1=23.3, shape2=0.83, scale2=21.3. This distribution is somewhat closer to the truth. Is there some way to change the MCMC settings to consistently get decent results for this sort of problem? Any advice about using PyMC more effectively is much appreciated. Update -- tried an "assisted" MCMC run: I also tried assisting the MCMC run by initializing population-level parameters with values close to the truth. The results are somewhat better, but I now find a systematic bias. The histogram below shows the true distribution of observations (blue) against the fitted distribution (red). The right tail fits nicely, but the fit fails to capture the sharp peak at the left side. This bias occurs consistently, for population sizes n = 60 and 100. I am not sure if this is more of a PyMC question or a general MCMC algorithm issue.
@CODE:x[i] = t1[i] + t2[i]
t1[i] ~ Weibull(shape1, scale1)
t2[i] ~ Weibull(shape2, scale2) for i in xrange(n):
    x[i] = pm.Index('x_%i'%i, x=data, index=i) # data is a list of observations
    t1[i] = pm.Weibull('t1_%i'%i, alpha=shape1, beta=scale1)
    # Ensure that initial guess for t1 is not more than the observed sum:
    if t1[i].value >= x[i].value:
        t1[i].value = 0.95 * x[i].value for i in xrange(n):
    def subtractfunc(t1=t1, x=x, ii=i):
        return x[ii] - t1[ii]
    t2[i] = pm.Lambda('t2_%i'%i, subtractfunc) t2dist = np.empty(n, dtype=object)

@TITLE:Get browser.element into page objects with children
@CONTENT:I am doing testing when I fork a driver instance to send messages between browsers. I also use page objects for mapping the view. In my page objects I have other page objects, some of who inherits from another page object. Though, when I have forked a driver instance and have two browsers to work with, it's troublesome to get the element function from the forked driver in the page objects. Especially for the page object who other PO inherits from. This is a sample from my code: var NavBar = function () {  
    this.button = element(by.buttonText('Click'));
};

var MySiteElement = function () {
    this.someElement = element(by.name('hiddenElement'));
};

NavBar.prototype = new MySiteElement();

var HomeView = function (element) {
    this.navbar = new NavBar()
};

module.exports = HomeView;
 Let's say my spec looks like this: describe('Home View', funciton () {
    it('should get text from right browser', function () {
        browser.get('http://localhost:3000/#/home');
        var browser2 = browser.forkNewDriverInstance(true);
        var view = new HomeView(browser.element);
        var view2 = new HomeView(browser2.element);
        view2.navbar.content.click()
        expect(view.navbar.someElement.getText()).toBe('unchanged')
        expect(view2.navbar.someElement.getText()).toBe('changed')
    });
});
 Let's say that my site is composed so that when the navbar button is clicked, the someElement's text change to 'changed'. But I have to click on the right element, and it's not right to use just element when I have a forked browser that I want to interact with. But I don't know how to set the right element variable inside the HomeView page object. I now that browser2.element get me the element variable from the forked driver, but how do I expose that to all the page object. Currently I pass the browser instance's element property as an argument to the page object, but I don't know how to go further. Please help, this has got me crazy!
@CODE:var NavBar = function () {  
    this.button = element(by.buttonText('Click'));

@TITLE:How to send javascript variable to PHP server as $_FILE
@CONTENT:We have PHP code on a server that receives files into $_FILE and then stores them based on user/security considerations. On the client, we can currently send the file to the server as-is or we would like to process the file locally (in memory in js in the browser) and then deliver the file to the server. We can POST the processed file to the server using JSON, however there are issues with that. We would much prefer to send the contents of the client's javascript variable to the server to be received in $_FILE. (We cannot assume client will have the ability to save the file locally.) Do we have to imitate a FORM submission somehow? How to we send a javascript variable to be received as a PHP $_FILE? Thanks! UPDATE Blob definitely appears to be the right direction, but we are noticing that the Blob size is coming out 50% larger than the file that goes in to it. The file in $_FILE is also 50% larger. We have tried overriding the file type at Blob creation, based on other posts such as BlobBuilder ruins binary data, however it hasn't fixed the 50% increase in size. We are setting the Blob file type based on the drag and drop file type we receive. For example, we upload a 900K PDF file. Type was something like 'application/pdf'. The resultant blob was like 1,400K. Also tried with PNG.

@TITLE:When should I be using `sparse`?
@CONTENT:I've been looking through Matlab's sparse documentation trying to find whether there are any guidelines for when it makes sense to use a sparse representation rather than a full representation. For example, I have a matrix data with around 30% nonzero entries. I can check the memory used. whos data
  Name             Size                 Bytes  Class     Attributes

  data      84143929x11            4394073488  double    sparse    
 data = full(data);
whos data
  Name             Size                 Bytes  Class     Attributes

  data      84143929x11            7404665752  double              
 Here, I'm clearly saving memory, but would this be true of any matrix with 30% nonzero entries? What about 50% nonzero entries? Is there a rule of thumb for at what percentage I should switch to a full matrix? What about computationally? Is it as a rule slower or faster to do a matrix multiplication with a sparse matrix? Sparse Matrix Operations says that The computational complexity of sparse operations is proportional to nnz, the number of nonzero elements in the matrix. Computational complexity also depends linearly on the row size m and column size n of the matrix, but is independent of the product m*n, the total number of zero and nonzero elements. This is difficult to compare to a full matrix without knowing more details. Scipy's sparse matrix library explains pros and cons of each sparse format. For example for the csc_matrix Advantages of the CSC format efficient arithmetic operations CSC + CSC, CSC * CSC, etc. efficient column slicing fast matrix vector products (CSR, BSR may be faster) Disadvantages of the CSC format slow row slicing operations (consider CSR) changes to the sparsity structure are expensive (consider LIL or DOK) Does similar information about Matlab's sparse implementation exist? If so where can I find it?

@TITLE:How to set an Observer to Update Navigation Drawer after onActivityResult method's received an Intent result
@CONTENT:In my app I want to update the Navigation Drawer with the username's nickname and email after he's logged in. From my MainActivity I am starting a LoginActivity with the startActivityForResult(intent, PICK_ACCOUNT_REQUEST); method to get the users registered or logged in. After the LoginActivity returns the Intent data result (his NAME and EMAIL) back to MainActivity, the method onActivityResult() is called and there I try to update the class' global variables NAME and EMAIL with the newly received data, with no success: after every registration or log the two fields never show in the navigation drawer. Here's my code: In the beginning of the MainActivity class I assign two variables: String NAME = "Sign in", EMAIL = "";
 These two values are inserted in my navigation drawer. After I receive the result from LoginActivity I want to update these two fields in the onActivityResult() method. This way: @Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){
    // Check which request we're responding to
    if (requestCode == PICK_ACCOUNT_REQUEST) {
        // Make sure the request was successful
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            // The user picked a contact.
            String usr = data.getStringExtra("username");
            String mal = data.getStringExtra("email");
            this.NAME = usr;this.EMAIL=mal;
        }
    }
}
 with no success, in fact after completion of LoginActivity I still visualize the old values within the Navigation Drawer because I'm not able to access the 2 EditText holding Username and Password from MainActivity. In fact the 2 EditText are managed inside RecyclerView.ViewHolder. How can I set an Observer or something similar to dinamically update my Navigation Drawer's RecyclerView.Adapter? More details below * EDIT * Ps. My Navigation Drawer is implemented with RecyclerView, I therefore have a RecyclerView.Adapter class and a RecyclerView.ViewHolder class inside the adapter. In MainActivity I have this code: public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity{

@TITLE:Monomorphism restriction triggered when generic instance defined
@CONTENT:Consider the following: {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies, FlexibleContexts, GADTs, MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

type family F r

class (Functor t) => T t r where
  fromScalar :: r -> t r

data Foo t r where
  Foo :: t (F r) -> Foo t r
  Scalar :: r -> Foo t r

toF :: r -> F r
toF = undefined

convert :: (T t (F r))
  => Foo t r -> Foo t r
convert (Scalar c) = 
  let fromScalar' = fromScalar
  in Foo $ fromScalar' $ toF c
 This code compiles with GHC 7.8.4. When I add a generic instance for T (which requires FlexibleInstances): instance (Functor t, Num r) => T t r
 GHC complains: Could not deduce (Num (F r)) arising from a use of ¡¥fromScalar¡¦
    from the context (T t (F r))
      bound by the type signature for
                 convert :: (T t (F r)) => Foo t r -> Foo t r
      at Main.hs:(17,12)-(18,23)

    In an equation for ¡¥fromScalar'¡¦: fromScalar' = fromScalar
    In the expression:
      let fromScalar' = fromScalar in Foo $ fromScalar' $ toF c
 I remembered this question, but there seem to be some key differences. First and most important, GHC didn't complain pre-instance. Second, I don't have RankNTypes, which seemed to be at the core of the problem with that question. Finally, adding NoMonoLocalBinds doesn't help. Strangely, adding NoMonomorphismRestriction does change the error message from complaining about fromScalar to the same message about fromScalar'. Of course the problem can be fixed by adding a type signature to fromScalar and adding ScopedTypeVariables: convert :: forall t r . (T t (F r))
  => Foo t r -> Foo t r
convert (Scalar c) = 
  let fromScalar' = fromScalar :: F r -> t (F r)
  in Foo $ fromScalar' $ toF c
 I'm willing to concede something screwy with monomorphic types is at work here, even though removing the restrictions didn't help. My question is: why is the restriction triggered by the addition of a generic instance? More importantly, why does GHC try to match the generic instance instead of using the T (F r) constraint? That seems plain wrong, and smells of this bug.

@TITLE:ggplot2: How to match legend height to plot area?
@CONTENT:I am trying to use ggplot to plot a heatmap and a linechart in one image with the heatmap on the bottom and the chart on top. I have succeeded in aligning the plot areas of the two plots but still have some difficulty with the legend of the heatmap. What I want to accomplish is that the legend has the same height as the plot area of the heatmap. In other words: the same length as the y-axis. I know that I can change the height and size of the legend using theme(legend.key.height=unit(...)), but this would take many trial and errors before I find an adequate setting. I have already messed with this for hours, but can't get it to work. Is there a way to specify the height of the legend so that it is exactly the same height of the plot area of the heatmap and would retain that ratio when plotting to a pdf? See some example code below. #Create some test data

@TITLE:Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (BPMF) with PyMC3: PositiveDefiniteError using `NUTS`
@CONTENT:I've implemented the Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization algorithm using pymc3 in Python. I also implemented it's precursor, Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). See my previous question for a reference to the data used here. I'm having trouble drawing MCMC samples using the NUTS sampler. I initialize the model parameters using the MAP from PMF, and the hyperparameters using Gaussian random draws sprinkled around 0. However, I get a PositiveDefiniteError when setting up the step object for the sampler. I've verified that the MAP estimate from PMF is reasonable, so I expect it has something to do with the way the hyperparameters are being initialized. Here is the PMF model: import pymc3 as pm
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import theano
import scipy as sp

data = pd.read_csv('jester-dense-subset-100x20.csv')    
n, m = data.shape
test_size = m / 10
train_size = m - test_size

train = data.copy()
train.ix[:,train_size:] = np.nan  # remove test set data
train[train.isnull()] = train.mean().mean()  # mean value imputation
train = train.values

test = data.copy()
test.ix[:,:train_size] = np.nan  # remove train set data
test = test.values    

# Low precision reflects uncertainty; prevents overfitting
alpha_u = alpha_v = 1/np.var(train)
alpha = np.ones((n,m)) * 2  # fixed precision for likelihood function
dim = 10  # dimensionality

# Specify the model.
with pm.Model() as pmf:
    pmf_U = pm.MvNormal('U', mu=0, tau=alpha_u * np.eye(dim),
                        shape=(n, dim), testval=np.random.randn(n, dim)*.01)
    pmf_V = pm.MvNormal('V', mu=0, tau=alpha_v * np.eye(dim),
                        shape=(m, dim), testval=np.random.randn(m, dim)*.01)
    pmf_R = pm.Normal('R', mu=theano.tensor.dot(pmf_U, pmf_V.T),
                      tau=alpha, observed=train)

    # Find mode of posterior using optimization
    start = pm.find_MAP(fmin=sp.optimize.fmin_powell)
 And here is BPMF: n, m = data.shape
dim = 10  # dimensionality
beta_0 = 1  # scaling factor for lambdas; unclear on its use
alpha = np.ones((n,m)) * 2  # fixed precision for likelihood function

        start[key] = bpmf.test_point[key]

with bpmf:
    step = pm.NUTS(scaling=start)
 At the last line, I get the following error: PositiveDefiniteError: Scaling is not positive definite. Simple check failed. Diagonal contains negatives. Check indexes [   0    2   ...  2206  2207  ]
 As I understand it, I can't use find_MAP with models that have hyperpriors like BPMF. This is why I'm attempting to initialize with the MAP values from PMF, which uses point estimates for the parameters on U and V rather than parameterized hyperpriors.

@TITLE:How to use ES6 with PhantomJS
@CONTENT:Is there a way to use ES6 and modules with PhantomJS? I can transpile each file from ES6 to ES5 using Babel, but it's awkward to maintain parallel trees (one in ES6 and another in ES5) and write the imports to require the ES5 modules. I'm looking for a cleaner solution. I can remove all import and export code, concatenate the modules together, transpile the result into a single file, then run in through PhantomJS, but I'd prefer to use imports and exports if possible. I tried using Browserify with the babelify transform to transpile the ES6 dependency tree into a single ES5 file, but Browserify can't find PhantomJS-provided modules like webpage. I've tried ignoring those modules by putting in my package.json: "browser": {
  "webpage": false
}
 but importing webpage returns an empty object instead of the PhantomJS module. Is there a clean way to use ES6 modules with PhantomJS?

@TITLE:How do I differentiate an lvalue and rvalue member function pointer for overloaded functions?
@CONTENT:I know that I can do this to differentiate a rvalue function name and an lvalue function pointer: template <typename RET_TYPE, typename...ARGs>
void takeFunction(RET_TYPE(& function)(ARGs...))
{
    cout << "RValue function" << endl;
}

template <typename RET_TYPE, typename...ARGs>

}

void function()
{
}

void testFn()
{
    void(*f)() = function;
    takeFunction(function);
    takeFunction(f);
}
 And I wish to do the same for member functions. However, it doesn't seem to translate: struct S;
void takeMemberFunction(void(S::&function)()) // error C2589: '&' : illegal token on right side of '::'
{
    cout << "RValue member function" << endl;
}

void takeMemberFunction(void(S::*&function)())
{
    cout << "LValue member function" << endl;
}

struct S
{
    void memberFunction()
    {
    }
};

void testMemberFn()
{
    void(S::*mf)() = &S::memberFunction;
    takeMemberFunction(S::memberFunction);
    takeMemberFunction(mf);
}
 Why? An alternative I know is to do this for regular functions: void takeFunction(void(*&& function)())
{
    cout << "RValue function" << endl;
}

void takeFunction(void(*& function)())
{
    cout << "LValue function" << endl;
}

void function()
{
}

void testFn()
{
    void(*f)() = function;
    takeFunction(&function);
    takeFunction(f);
}
 Which does translate to member functions: struct S;
void takeMemberFunction(void(S::*&&function)())
{
    cout << "RValue member function" << endl;
}

void takeMemberFunction(void(S::*&function)())
{
    cout << "LValue member function" << endl;
}

struct S
{
    void memberFunction()
    {
    }
};

void testMemberFn()
{
    void(S::*mf)() = &S::memberFunction;
    takeMemberFunction(&S::memberFunction); // error C2664: 'void takeMemberFunction(void (__thiscall S::* &)(void))' : cannot convert argument 1 from 'void (__thiscall S::* )(void)' to 'void (__thiscall S::* &)(void)'
    takeMemberFunction(mf);
}
 But I would like to know the discrepancy for my first example not translating.
@CODE:template <typename RET_TYPE, typename...ARGs>
void takeFunction(RET_TYPE(& function)(ARGs...))
{
    cout << "RValue function" << endl;

# How to choose a different type of plot?
 /edit. So I found out that you can use custom plotters with dygraphs like on here: http://blog.dygraphs.com/2012/08/introducing-custom-plotters.html. Is there any way to get that in R?

@TITLE:How to add to a list type in Python Eve without replacing old values
@CONTENT:I have a very similar setup to the person in this question: How do I update a list data_relation in Python Eve with a users resource and a friends sub-resource of list type. users = {

 However, when I try to add a new value to the friends list, the other values in the list get replaced by the new value. How do I add a single value to the list and keep the old values? GET /users/5522987f893e3902048c55ff

 I have to create a loop which: a) Calculates the upper and lower limit (UL and LL) for each column from the third column onwards. b) Only includes rows that fall outside of the UL and LL (Zoutliers). c) Then count the number of rows where the Zoutlier is the same direction (i.e. positive or negative) as the previous or the subsequent row for the same chr. The output would therefore be:  ZScore1    TBGGT     12_try      324Gtt       AMN2
 nrow        4         6            4           4
 So far I have code as follows:   library(data.table)#v1.9.5
  f1 <- function(df, ZCol){

  #A) Determine the UL and LL and then generate the Zoutliers
  UL = median(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE) + alpha*IQR(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE)
  LL = median(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE) - alpha*IQR(ZCol, na.rm = TRUE)
  Zoutliers <- which(ZCol > UL | ZCol < LL)

  #B) Exclude Zoutliers per chr if same direction as previous or subsequent row
  na.omit(as.data.table(df)[, {tmp = sign(eval(as.name(ZCol)))
  .SD[tmp==shift(tmp) | tmp==shift(tmp, type='lead')]},
  by=chr])[, list(.N)]}

  nm1 <- paste0(names(df)
  setnames(do.call(cbind,lapply(nm1, function(x) f1(df, x))), nm1)[]

@TITLE:Stored procedure SQL execution plan
@CONTENT:I'm a bit stuck with a stored procedure that is executing really slow. The stored procedure basically contains a query that uses an incoming parameter (in_id) and is put in a cursor like this: open tmp_cursor for 
select col1, col2, col3
from table1 tab
where ((in_id is null) or (tab.id = in_id));  -- tab.id is the PK
 When I get an execution plan for the SQL query separately with predefined value, I get good results with the query using an index. However when I call the procedure from my application, I see that no index is being used and the table gets full scan, thus giving slow performance. If I remove the first part of WHERE clause "(in_id is null)" the performance from the application is fast again. How come the index isn't used during the call from my application (in_id is passed in)?

@CONTENT:I am coding outside the kernel source tree. There are two modules, the first one printt have a function printtty() to print string to the current tty, and the second module hello which invokes printtty() during initialization. I have added EXPORT_SYMBOL(printtty) in module printt, and after insmod ./printt.ko, the information of printtty() can be seen in /proc/kallsyms. The make process of module hello goes all right. But insmod ./hello.ko will cause an error like: insmod: ERROR: could not insert module hello.ko: Invalid parameters
 and dmesg shows hello: no symbol version for printtty
hello: Unknown symbol printtty (err -22)`.
 I've fixed this by (1) Copy the .ko file to a location beneath /lib/modules/version/kernel (2) Add the exported symbols to /lib/modules/version/build/Module.symvers But I wonder is there any way to export a symbol just from an external module(without modifying kernel source tree)?

I have no idea if this is a problem with the website host or something I can do in my app. Basically I have an online portfolio I'm making for university and I want to make myself look better by building it into an app. The portfolio site includes a mobile version so it's already set up for that and works fine in the chrome browser on my phone. It used to work with an old site and it loads google so I know I have the internet permission right. Not sure if it's something to do with my new site or I just need to change something to make it work. In the chrome browser it looks as it should, which isn't good at the moment because I wanted to do this first before I added content to it. This is how it looks. (Can't post a screenshot directly as I don't have enough rep, sorry) Here is my main app code: package com.broadbentstudios;

import android.annotation.SuppressLint;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.KeyEvent;
import android.webkit.WebView;
import android.webkit.WebViewClient;
import com.parse.ParseAnalytics;

@SuppressLint("SetJavaScriptEnabled")
public class ParseStarterProjectActivity extends Activity {

    WebView webView;
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        webView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.mainWebView);
        webView.setBackgroundColor(0x00000000);
        webView.setHorizontalScrollBarEnabled(false);
        webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
        webView.getSettings().setUseWideViewPort(true);
        webView.loadUrl("http://www.broadbentstudios.com/");

        webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
            @Override
            public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url)
            {
                view.loadUrl(url);
                return true;
            }                
        });
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
        if ((keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK) && webView!=null && webView.canGoBack()) {
            webView.goBack();
            return true;
        }
        return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
    }        
    {
        ParseAnalytics.trackAppOpenedInBackground(getIntent());
    }       
}

@TITLE:no more offline speech recognition?
@CONTENT:Today I noticed that offline speech recognition doesn't work anymore. It worked before because I was able to use it for my app and I'm completely sure that I was offline and everything was working fine then. I wanted to test my app today and it couldn't understand what I said no matter how loud I said it. Then I turned the wifi on and it was working perfectly. I'm using the same phone though, sony xperia L, same OS, Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2. I have no idea what happened. Has Google changed something or what? And it's not just my app, other apps that need speech recognition won't work offline as well. Can someone explain this and tell me if there something I can do to get offline speech recognition again, or at least make it work for my app? Thanks in advance! EDIT: i've tested it on xperia z2 now and it has the same problem, so it's not only my phone, i believe there was an update with some bugs from google, what do you think? is it going to be fixed or do i have to fix it? i want my app to work offline EDIT 2: i solved my problem by uninstalling all updates on Google App and getting back its factory version.

@TITLE:Awaited Async method not returning before result is required
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble getting my head round an issue I'm having with async / await. in a nutshell, I have a controller, decorated with an attribute. This attribute gets the specified content from an i/o intensive process (filesystem / db / api etc...) It then sets the returned content as a Dictionary<string, string> on the ViewBag Then, in a view, I can do something like this, to retrieve the content: @(ViewBag.SystemContent["Common/Footer"])
 The issue I'm having, is the first time it runs, the content hasn't returned, and the call to retrieve the value by string index fails, as it doesn't exist. Hit F5, and it's fine. Controller action is pretty simple: [ProvideContent("Common/Footer")]
public class ContactDetailsController : Controller
{
    public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
    {
        //omitted for brevity - awaits some other async methods
        return View();
    }
}
 The attribute public override async void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
{
    if (filterContext.Result is ViewResult)
    {
        var localPath = filterContext.RouteData.Values["controller"] + "/" + filterContext.RouteData.Values["action"];

        if (!_useControllerActionAsPath)
            localPath = _path;

        var viewResult = filterContext.Result as ViewResult;

        //this seems to go off and come back AFTER the view requests it from the dictionary
        var content = await _contentManager.GetContent(localPath);

        if (viewResult.ViewBag.SystemContent == null)
            viewResult.ViewBag.SystemContent = new Dictionary<string, MvcHtmlString>();

        viewResult.ViewBag.SystemContent[localPath] = new DisplayContentItem(content, localPath);
    }
 EDIT Changing the following line in my Attribute: var content = await _contentManager.GetContent(localPath);
 To var content = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
            manager.GetContent(localPath).Result, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning).Result;
 solves the problem, but I feel it goes against everything I've read on Stephen Clearys blog...

@TITLE:Kafka: Get broker host from ZooKeeper
@CONTENT:For particular reasons I need to use both - ConsumerGroup (a.k.a. high-level consumer) and SimpleConsumer (a.k.a. low-level consumer) to read from Kafka. For ConsumerGroup I use ZooKeeper-based config and am completely satisfied with it, but SimpleConsumer requires seed brokers to be instantiated. I don't want to keep list of both - ZooKeeper and broker hosts. Thus, I'm looking for a way to automatically discover brokers for a particular topic from ZooKeeper. Because of some indirect information I belief that these data is stored in ZooKeeper under one of the following paths: /brokers/topics/<topic>/partitions/<partition-id>/state /brokers/ids/ However, when I try to read data from these nodes, I'm getting serialization error (I'm using com.101tec.zkclient for this): org.I0Itec.zkclient.exception.ZkMarshallingError: java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 7B226A6D at org.I0Itec.zkclient.serialize.SerializableSerializer.deserialize(SerializableSerializer.java:37) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient.derializable(ZkClient.java:740) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient.readData(ZkClient.java:773) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient.readData(ZkClient.java:761) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient.readData(ZkClient.java:750) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.ZkClient.readData(ZkClient.java:744) ... 64 elided Caused by: java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 7B226A6D at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readStreamHeader(ObjectInputStream.java:804) at java.io.ObjectInputStream.(ObjectInputStream.java:299) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.serialize.TcclAwareObjectIputStream.(TcclAwareObjectIputStream.java:30) at org.I0Itec.zkclient.serialize.SerializableSerializer.deserialize(SerializableSerializer.java:31) ... 69 more I can write and read custom Java objects (e.g. Strings) without any problem, so I believe it's not a problem of a client, but rather tricky encoding.

@LINK:/questions/29480426/how-to-override-a-calabash-predefined-step
@TITLE:How to override a Calabash predefined step?
@CONTENT:I'm defining custom calabash steps (to use on both iOS and Android) and would like to selectively override various predefined steps. An example is: Given /^I press the "([^\"]*)" button$/ do |text|
  tap_when_element_exists("android.widget.Button {text CONTAINS[c] '#{text}'}")
end
 Instead of using this implementation, I would like to provide my own. If I define and use a step with a matching regex I get an error: Ambiguous match of "I press the "big red" button"
 It also suggests using "--guess" but that didn't help, and I still get the Cucumber::Ambiguous error. I could make some arbitrary change to the regex for my step, ex: I tap the "big red" button
 But that feels like a poor solution for a few reasons Having to prevent usage of the built in step, especially since it may be the most natural phrasing If canned_steps adds a conflicting step in a future revision, I'd be forced to change my phrasing and all my scenarios It also appears that the phrasing is a bit different between the Android and iOS predefined steps. If I can't override, this means I need to avoid using the iOS predefined steps on Android, even though I will not get the Cucumber::Ambiguous error on Android. In general I don't like to tell the scenario authors (often QA) to not use a particular phrasing, I would rather add alternate phrasing than remove options Is there a way to un-define a built in step? The android canned_step documentation suggests there should be: You can add your own steps or change the ones you see here I don't want to lose ALL the predefined steps immediately either (ex: not require calabash_steps.rb). I'd rather phase them out only when they become a problem. And I don't want to directly edit the calabash code if I can help it, as that would require rolling my own calabash distro instead of using gem to install it.
@CODE:Given /^I press the "([^\"]*)" button$/ do |text|
  tap_when_element_exists("android.widget.Button {text CONTAINS[c] '#{text}'}")

@CONTENT:I'm on an EC2 instance and I wish to connect my PHP website with my Amazon S3 bucket, I already saw the API for PHP here: http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforphp/ but it's not clear. This is the code line I need to edit in my controller: thisFu['original_img']='/uploads/fufu/'.$_POST['cat'].'/original_'.uniqid('fu_').'.jpg';
 I need to connect to Amazon S3 and be able to change the code like this: $thisFu['original_img']='my_s3_bucket/uploads/fufu/'.$_POST['cat'].'/original_'.uniqid('fu_').'.jpg';
 I already configured an IAM user for the purpose but I don't know all the steps needed to accomplished the job. How could I connect and interact with Amazon S3 to upload and retrieve public images? UPDATE I decided to try using the s3fs as suggested, so I installed it as described here (my OS is Ubuntu 14.04) I run from console: sudo apt-get install build-essential git libfuse-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev mime-support automake libtool
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-openssl
make
sudo make install
 Everything was properly installed but what's next? Where should I declare credentials and how could I use this integration in my project? 2nd UPDATE I created a file called .passwd-s3fs with a single code line with my IAM credentials accessKeyId:secretAccessKey. I place it into my home/ubuntu directory and give it a 600 permission with chmod 600 ~/.passwd-s3fs Next from console I run /usr/bin/s3fs My_S3bucket /uploads/fufu Inside the /uploads/fufu there are all my bucket folders now. However when I try this command: s3fs -o nonempty allow_other My_S3bucket /uploads/fufu
 I get this error message: s3fs: unable to access MOUNTPOINT My_S3bucket : No such file or directory
 3rd UPDATE As suggested I run this fusermount -u /uploads/fufu, after that I checked the fufu folder and is empty as expected. After that I tried again this command (with one more -o): s3fs -o nonempty -o allow_other My_S3bucket /uploads/fufu
 and got this error message: fusermount: failed to open /etc/fuse.conf: Permission denied
fusermount: option allow_other only allowed if 'user_allow_other' is set in /etc/fuse.conf
 Any other suggestion? 4th UPDATE 18/04/15 Under suggestion from console I run sudo usermod -a -G fuse ubuntu and sudo vim /etc/fuse.conf where I uncommented mount_max = 1000 and user_allow_other Than I run s3fs -o nonempty -o allow_other My_S3bucket /uploads/fufu At first sight no errors, so I thought everythings fine but it's exactly the opposite. I'm a bit frustrated now, because I don't know what happened but my folder /uploads/fufu is hidden and using ls -Al I see only this d????????? ? ?        ?              ?            ? fufu

@TITLE:Why does the presence of primary key on the table significantly enhance the performance of column-store indexes?
@CONTENT:I was trying to see the kind of performance gains column-store indexes can provide on a table. The table has about a 3.7 million rows, 11 columns and is stored as a heap (i.e without a primary key). I create a column-store index on the table and run the following query: SELECT 
    [Area], [Family],
    AVG([Global Sales Value]) AS [Average GlobalSalesValue],
    COUNT([Projected Sales])
FROM 
    dbo.copy_Global_Previous5FullYearSales
WHERE 
    [Year] > 2012  
GROUP BY 
    [Area], [Family]
 The create table statement is as follows: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[copy_Global_Previous5FullYearSales]
(
    [SBU] [NVARCHAR](10) NULL,
    [Year] [INT] NULL,
    [Global Sales Value] [MONEY] NULL,
    [Area] [NVARCHAR](50) NULL,
    [Sub Area] [NVARCHAR](50) NULL,
    [Projected Sales] [MONEY] NULL,
    [Family] [NVARCHAR](50) NULL,
    [Sub Family 1] [NVARCHAR](50) NULL,
    [Sub Family 2] [NVARCHAR](50) NULL,
    [Manufacturer] [NVARCHAR](40) NULL,
    [rowguid] [UNIQUEIDENTIFIER] NOT NULL,
    [ID] [INT] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([ID] ASC)
        WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, 
              IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, 
              ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY]
 The performance gains I get from column-store index in this case is negligible. The query with the column-store index runs nearly as slow as the original query without an index, in some cases, even slower, even though batch mode is processing is used too. Surprisingly, when I create an ever increasing primary key - ID on the existing table and rebuild the column-store index, I get a 15X improvement on the CPU time and a 3X improvement on the elapsed time. I don't understand how the addition of a primary key could affect query performance for column-store indexes which store the data in a compressed format anyway. Also primary keys only change the ordering of the pages which in this case, would be none. Below is the execution plan
@CODE:SELECT 
    [Area], [Family],
    AVG([Global Sales Value]) AS [Average GlobalSalesValue],
    COUNT([Projected Sales])
FROM 
    dbo.copy_Global_Previous5FullYearSales

    [Year] > 2012

    [Area], [Family] CREATE TABLE [dbo].[copy_Global_Previous5FullYearSales]

    [SBU] [NVARCHAR](10) NULL,

@CONTENT:I'm trying to access to an IMAP account using MailKit (created by jstedfast) I manage to download the message (as a MimeMessage), and at some point I need to "forward" it to another account. How would be the best way to do it, in order to preserve all the information of the original email (adresses, headers, body content, etc). Thanks!

@TITLE:Java HTTP/2 Server Socket
@CONTENT:I want to get server sockets working for HTTP/2 in Java, preferably TLS/https. I've got a TLS server socket working fine, but browsers will only talk HTTP/1.1 to it. If I understand correctly, you need ALPN to get a HTTP/2 browser to connect to your TLS socket and start running HTTP/2 on it; browsers won't ask for upgrade to HTTP/2 on https. It seems Java8 does not do ALPN so far. Maybe there is some other way to coerce browsers to do HTTP/2, at least non-TLS. So, anybody know how to make a Java server socket for HTTP/2?

@LINK:/questions/29398202/how-to-get-a-multi-threaded-dot-function
@TITLE:How to get a multi-threaded dot() function?
@CONTENT:When I execute this in the REPL of Julia v0.3.7 on my 64-bit Windows 8.1 PC with 8 logical CPU cores: blas_set_num_threads(CPU_CORES)
const v=ones(Float64,100000)
@time for k=1:1000000;s=dot(v,v);end
 I observe in the CPU meter of Task Manager or Process Explorer that only 12.5% CPU (1 logical CPU core) is being used. I also observe the same thing with Julia v0.3.5, on both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. I also observe the same behavior by starting up with "Julia -p 8" on the command line. Returning to running the Julia REPL without the "-p 8" command-line option, I tried this test: blas_set_num_threads(CPU_CORES)
@time peakflops(10000)
 The CPU meter shows 100% CPU usage in this case. Since dot() and peakflops() both use BLAS (OpenBLAS in my case), I expect both to use the number of threads specified by blas_set_num_threads(). However, only the latter function actually does. Is the behavior of dot() due to a bug, maybe in OpenBLAS? I tried to work around Julia's shortcoming by using the matrix multiply function. However, I am iterating on dot() operations on subvectors of GB-size 2D arrays, where the subvectors use contiguous memory. Matrix multiply forces me to transpose each vector, which creates a copy. This is costly within the inner loop. Therefore, the choice for me seems to be either learn how to use Julia's parallel processing commands/macros or go back to Python (where Intel's MKL BLAS operates as expected for ddot()). Since dot() is the function that consumes 99% of the CPU in the routine I am trying to code, I was hoping that OpenBLAS would give me a user-friendly optimum solution in Julia without having to worry about all the parallel processing complexity under the hood. But maybe it isn't so bad... I could use some creating a multi-threaded dot() function. Some example code would be the best help. Do I need to use SharedArray when all threads run on the same machine? If so, does converting from Array to SharedArray create a copy? Since my arrays are very large, I don't want two copies in memory simultaneously. Because my vectors are about 100,000 in length, and vectors from one array are utilized in an unpredictable order, the best multi-threaded solution for me would be a dot() function that splits up the task among the available cores and sums the result from each core. How to do that in Julia as efficiently as BLAS? I saw Tim Holy's answer here: BLAS v. parallel updates for Julia SharedArray objects However, his example (I think) executes an entire dot() function on one core, and it doesn't answer my other questions. Edit 1: I tried running Julia with the "-p 8" command-line option and replacing dot() in my above example with innersimd() from here: http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/manual/performance-tips/ Still uses only 1 core. I modified innersimd() to type its arguments as ::Array{Float64, 1} and then ::SharedArray{Float64, 1}, but this still also uses 1 core. :( Edit 2: I tested Julia's matrix multiplication (BLAS' gemm!() function): blas_set_num_threads(CPU_CORES)
const A=ones(Float64,(4,100000))
const B=ones(Float64,(100000,4))
@time for k=1:100000;s=A*B;end
 Even with Julia started without the "-p" command line option, Julia uses only one core. Edit 3: Here is comparable test code for Python: import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg.blas import ddot
from timeit import default_timer as timer
v = np.ones(100000)
start = timer()
for k in range(1000000):
    s = ddot(v,v)
exec_time=(timer() - start)
print
print("Execution took", str(round(exec_time, 3)), "seconds")
 I got the same result on 64-bit Anaconda3 v2.1.0 and WinPython: 7.5 seconds. Compare to the first example in my question, using Julia 0.3.7 with OpenBLAS, executed in 28 seconds. That's makes Python about 4 times faster than Julia, which is explained by OpenBLAS' single-threaded implementation of ddot(). Edit 4: I did some testing in Python with effectively executing a (4xN)*(Nx2) matrix multiply in my inner loop (N=100000), and I found it to be more than twice as slow. I suspect that this is because the cache demands are now 8 times larger, so the cache hit rate is worse. To keep the cache demands the same in Julia as Python, the question for Julia is: how to break my 100000-length vectors into 4 chunks and execute OpenBLAS' single-threaded ddot() in parallel (and sum the results)? The length may not be exactly a multiple of 4. Since OpenBLAS would be single-threaded, I can run Julia with the "-p 8" command line argument and multi-thread other custom functions in the same session. Edit 5: Running Julia v0.3.7 with the "-p 8" command line argument, I observe that OpenBLAS gemm!() function does run as multithreaded (for certain matrix dimensions): blas_set_num_threads(CPU_CORES)
const a = rand(10000, 10000)
@time a * a
@CODE:blas_set_num_threads(CPU_CORES)

@TITLE:Google Cloud Storage Javascript Usage
@CONTENT:i am trying to upload images into buckets on Google Cloud Storage using the JSON API, using the Javascript sample: Api Javascript Sample I am able to upload pictures but it asks me to log in on my google account. Tthe sample has an Authorization button, which I understand manages the OAuth credentials.     function checkAuth() {
  gapi.auth.authorize({
    client_id: clientId,
    scope: scopes,
    immediate: true
  }, handleAuthResult);
}
 The problem is: I want to authenticate without having the pop up screen, that means without login in with Google. Because my client doesn't know the email or password, I want it to be automatically. How can I achieve this? Thanks! -----------------------------UPDATE-------------------- So following Brandon's answer i have done the following: I have created my policy document and signed it like this: var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var p12ToPem = require("./node_modules/p12-to-pem/p12ToPem.js");
var p12File = fs.readFileSync("./KEY.p12");
var pemKey = p12ToPem(p12File, "notasecret");
 var policyJson={"expiration": "2050-06-16T11:11:11Z",
"conditions": [["starts-with", "$key", "" ],
{"acl": "bucket-owner-read" },
{"bucket": "my-bucket'name"},
{"success_action_redirect":"http://www.example.com/success_notification.html" },
 ["eq", "$Content-Type", "image/jpeg" ],
 ["content-length-range", 0, 1000000]
 ]
};
var policyJson64 = new Buffer(''+policyJson).toString('base64');
var sign = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');
sign.update(policyJson64);
var sig = sign.sign(pemKey, 'base64')
console.log("policyJson64:"+policyJson64);
console.log("sig:"+sig);
 And my post form is the following:   <form action="http://my-bucket-name.storage.googleapis.com" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="text" name="key" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="bucket" value="my-bucket-name">

<input type="hidden" name="signature" value="NEITHER HERE">
<input name="file" type="file">
<input type="submit" value="Upload">
 No matter the combinations obtained in the javascrypt I cant seem to figure out what goes into policy and what into signature,and YES! I have read the API but it is not clear on what goes in those 2 inputs.. I have tried putting on the policy input the value of PolicyJson64 and sig as well. And I have tried putting on the signature input the value of sig and pemKey too. I get this error: <Error>

However, it's hard to get a closed boundary using canny edge detector. Result using Sobel filter is not that bad, however I don't how to proceed from there.

@CONTENT:Let's say I have two Proxy in Haskell Pipes. They represent external system processes. produce :: MonadIO m => Producer ByteString m ExitCode
consume :: MonadIO m => Consumer ByteString m ExitCode
 So I hook them into an Effect, like this: effect :: Effect m ExitCode
effect = produce >-> consume
 This Effect is going to give me the ExitCode from the first Proxy that terminates. Ordinarily this will be the produce, not the consume. What's the idiomatic Pipes way to get the return value of the consume even if it does not terminate first? So far I am thinking this is not possible without doing some sort of icky in-band signaling so the consume knows the stream is done. The only way the last Proxy knows to shut down is by getting something from an await, so I could send it an empty ByteString to signal that the stream is done. That just doesn't feel right though. What I've got now is a separate MVar that can provide the exit value but I'm thinking there has to be a more idiomatic way to do this.

   2:               A         3          19600  2005-03-31
   3:               B         3          18200  2005-06-30
   4:               B         4          1230   2005-09-30
   5:               C         2          8700   2005-12-31
 The difference is that every 'ida' has his own dates and there is at least one row where 'ida' appears with each date but not necessarily for all 'idb'. I want to insert every missing ('ida','idb') couple missing with the corresponding date and 0 as a value. Moreover, there is no periodicity for the dates. How would you do this ? Desired output :                    ida       idb         value     date

   4:               B         3            0    2005-09-30
   5:               B         4          1230   2005-09-30

   6:               C         2          8700   2005-12-31
 The order doesn't matter. Every date missing is filled with a 0 value.

@TITLE:How to add custom view inside another custom view?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to add CustomViewBeta (an extended RelativeLayout) to CustomViewAlpha (an extended LinearLayout) -- the idea being that the CustomViewAlpha will hold a bunch of CustomViewBetas a la a ListView. No matter what I try, it doesn't work. I either see nothing -- no CustomViewBetas, or it gives me an NPE when I try setText on one of the TextViews inside the CustomViewBeta CustomViewAlpha works fine since it's hard-coded in the Fragment's XML: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<FrameLayout
   ...>
    <com.path.CustomViewAlpha
        android:id="@+id/customviewalpha"
        android:orientation="vertical"
        android:layout_gravity="center_vertical"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
</FrameLayout>
 With the code being: public class CustomViewAlpha extends LinearLayout {
private Context mContext;

public CustomViewAlpha (Context context) {
    super(context);
    this.mContext = context;
}

public CustomViewAlpha (Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    super(context, attrs);
    this.mContext = context;
}

public CustomViewAlpha (Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle){
    super(context, attrs,defStyle);
    this.mContext = context;
}

public void addCustomViewBeta(String someString){
    CustomViewBeta customViewBeta = new CustomViewBeta(mContext);
    addView(customViewBeta);
}
 CustomViewBeta is not hard-coded in the Fragment's XML and get's added programmatically: public class CustomViewBeta extends RelativeLayout{ private Context mContext; private TextView textView;

public CustomViewBeta (Context context) {
    super(context);
    this.mContext = context;
    init();
}

public CustomViewBeta (Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    super(context, attrs);
    this.mContext = context;
    init();
}

public CustomViewBeta (Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle){
    super(context, attrs,defStyle);
    this.mContext = context;
    init();
}


private void init() {
    LayoutInflater.from(mContext).inflate(R.layout.customviewbeta, null, false);
    textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tripleexpandablelistview_category_name);
    textView.setText("ASDASDASDAD");
}
 With this XML being: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>

</com.path.CustomViewBeta>
 I usually get hit with a NPE on the "textView.setText("ASDASDASDAD");" line because the TextView is null. Is there something I'm missing? Should I not try to inflate an XML for the CustomViewBeta and just do it programmatically (adding the textviews one by one programmatically?)? Thanks.

@CONTENT:I'm implementing gesture catcher (swipe left/right) with MouseArea. It should work inside Flickable with vertical flickableDirection. Also it should propagate mouse events to other elements beneath it in visual stack order.

@LINK:/questions/29217361/recording-video-simultaneously-with-audio-in-chrome-blocks-on-main-thread-causi
@TITLE:Recording video simultaneously with audio in chrome blocks on main thread, causing invalid audio
@CONTENT:So, I have what I think is a fairly interesting and, hopefully, not intractable problem. I have an audio/video getUserMedia stream that I am recording in Chrome. Individually, the tracks record perfectly well. However, when attempting to record both, one blocks the main thread, hosing the other. I know that there is a way to resolve this. Muaz Khan has a few demos that seem to work without blocking. Audio is recorded via the web audio API. I am piping the audio track into a processor node which converts it to a 16b mono channel and streams it to a node.js server. Video is recorded via the usual canvas hack and Whammy.js. When recording, video frames are drawn to a canvas and then the resulting image data is pushed into a frames array which is later encoded into a webm container by Whammy, subsequently uploaded to the node.js server. The two are then muxed together via ffmpeg server-side and the result stored. The ideas I've had so far are: Delegate one to a worker thread. Unfortunately both the canvas and the stream are members of the DOM as far as I know. Install headless browser in node.js and establish an rtc connection with the client, thereby exposing the entire stream server-side The entire situation will eventually be solved by Audio Worker implementation. The working group seems to have stalled public progress updates on that while things are shuffled around a bit though. Any suggestions for resolving the thread blocking? Web Audio Connections: var context = new AudioContext();
var source = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
var node = context.createScriptProcessor(2048, 1, 1);
node.onaudioprocess = audioProcess;
source.connect(node);
node.connect(context.destination);
 Web Audio Processing: if (!recording.audio) return;
var leftChannel = e.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
Socket.emit('record-audio', convertFloat32ToInt16(leftChannel));
 Video Frame Buffering: if (recording.video) {
players.canvas.context.fillRect(0, 0, players.video.width, players.video.height);
players.canvas.context.drawImage(players.video.element, 0, 0, players.video.width, players.video.height);
    frames.push({
        duration: 100,
        image: players.canvas.element.toDataURL('image/webp')
    });
    lastTime = new Date().getTime();
    requestAnimationFrame(drawFrame);
} else {
    requestAnimationFrame(getBlob);
}
 Update: I've since managed to stop the two operations from completely blocking one another, but it's still doing it enough to distort my audio.
@CODE:var context = new AudioContext();
var source = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
var node = context.createScriptProcessor(2048, 1, 1);
node.onaudioprocess = audioProcess;

node.connect(context.destination); if (!recording.audio) return;

    });

@TITLE:How do I find cases of CoffeeScript 1.9.0 breaking change in my code?
@CONTENT:TL;DR: Is there any way to identify violations to CoffeeScript's new 1.9.0 behavior for @foo parameter naming? It is now illegal, and does not cause a warning/error, to use the bare foo variable in the function. In the 1.9.0 version of CoffeeScript is stated: Changed strategy for the generation of internal compiler variable names. Note that this means that @example function parameters are no longer available as naked example variables within the function body. This means class Animal
  constructor: (@name) ->
    console.log name
 .. will fail, silently. I.e the above will not print the new animal's name. The new correct solution is: class Animal
  constructor: (@name) ->
    console.log @name
 CoffeeLint does not catch this. Is there any known stunt for finding the now illegal bare parameter use? Maybe a nifty script running on the generated javascript? Here are 2 links about this: https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/coffeescript/SDRGFYXWBnQ https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/issues/3891

@TITLE:Azure webjob - graceful shutdown of a queue handling function
@CONTENT:I have a bunch of webjob queue handling functions: public static void ProcessSomething(
            [QueueTrigger("testrequest")] TestThing thing,
            TextWriter logger,
            CancellationToken token)
 I'm confused about graceful shutdown. So - when you shutdown the webjob (or re-deploy to it), it allows currently processing webjob to run and to complete - by default your Queue handler has 5 seconds to complete. You can pass a CancellationToken into the method to check for a cancellation request if it's likely that your webjob will take longer, as described in the 'Graceful Shutdown' section of this article. Ok, but what's weird is that I've found that when Queue handler is running during a shutdown, then the token has it's IsCancellationRequested set, but even if the function completes within, say a second, then that queue item is marked as "Never Finished", and in 10 mins (after the leasetime for that queue item expires), it comes back on the queue. Is that by design? Can I change that behavior? If for example your queue handler was sending an email, and it was firing during a shutdown, then it will send the email, then be marked as never finished, then send the email again 10 mins later. Help!

            [QueueTrigger("testrequest")] TestThing thing,

@TITLE:How to secure my Google Maps Javascript V3 API Key within an Ionic/Cordova App?
@CONTENT:I am currently developing an Ionic app where I have an embedded Google Map. The Google Maps V3 API recommends using an API key for tracking usage. The thing is when I create an API Key for browser usage I can only secure my API key by specifying referrers. Now I don't have a referrer on mobile devices so what can I do to avoid that other people can also use my API key?

@LINK:/questions/29148539/flux-react-js-callback-in-actions-is-good-or-bad
@TITLE:Flux + React.js - Callback in actions is good or bad?
@CONTENT:Let me explain the problem that I've faced recently. I have React.js + Flux powered application: There is a list view of articles (NOTE: there are multiple of of different lists in the app) and article details view inside it. But there is only one API endpoint per each list which returns array of articles. In order to display the details I need to find article by id in array. That works pretty fine. I trigger action which makes request to server and propagates store with data, when I go to details screen then I just get the necessary article from that array in store. When user lands on article details view before list (stores are empty) then I need to make a request. Flow looks like: User loads details view -> component did mount -> stores are empty -> rendered empty -> fetchArticles action is triggered -> request response is 200 -> stores now have list of articles -> component did update -> rendered with data successfully Component could look as follows: let DetailsComponent = React.createClass({
   _getStateFromStores() {
       let { articleId } = this.getParams();
       return {
           article: ArticleStore.getArticle(articleId)
       };
   },

   componentDidMount() {
       // fire only if user wasn't on the list before
       // stores are empty
       if (!this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchArticles('listType');
       }
   },

   render() {
      return <ArticleDetails article={this.state.article} />;
   }
});
 The interesting part comes next: Now I need to make another request to server but request options depend on the article details. That's why I need to make second request after the first one on the details view. I've tried several approaches but all of them look ugly. I don't like calling actions from stores that makes stores too complicated. Calling action inside action in this case doesn't work well because I will need to find article from store inside that action. Solution (?!) What I've came up with is to use callback in action inside component and it feels much more cleaner: let DetailsComponent = React.createClass({
   _getStateFromStores() {
       let { articleId } = this.getParams();
       return {
           article: ArticleStore.getArticle(articleId)
       };
   },

   componentDidMount() {
       if (!this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchArticles('listType', () => {
              this._requestAdditionalData();
          });
       }
       this._requestAdditionalData();
   },

   _requestAdditionalData() {
       if (this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchAdditional(this.state.article.property);
       }
   },

   render() {
      return <ArticleDetails article={this.state.article} />;
   }
});
 What's your input?
@CODE:find User loads details view component did mount stores are empty rendered empty fetchArticles action is triggered request response is 200 stores now have list of articles component did update rendered with data successfully let DetailsComponent = React.createClass({
   _getStateFromStores() {
       let { articleId } = this.getParams();
       return {
           article: ArticleStore.getArticle(articleId)
       };
   },

   componentDidMount() {
       // fire only if user wasn't on the list before
       // stores are empty
       if (!this.state.article) {
          ArticleActions.fetchArticles('listType');

@TITLE:How do I properly set an exception breakpoint in Android Studio?
@CONTENT:I have been trying for months to get my debugger to break on my own code, with no success. Every uncaught exception breaks in the ZygoteInit.run() method. Here is a list of actions I've taken. Added debug { debuggable true } to my app module's build.gradle file Manually added debuggable="true" to my AndroidManifest.xml file Checked the Any exception checkbox in the Breakpoints window Added relevant class filter patterns to the Any exception breakpoint this causes the debugger to completely skip all uncaught exceptions I have been debugging by looking at the stack trace in Logcat, which does show my classes in the stack trace. I have seen this version on current & previous builds in the stable AND canary channels. Is there something here I'm missing? EDIT: Just to clarify for people, the issue was that I had the "Caught exception" box unchecked. Checking this box fixed my issue.

@TITLE:Prediction in Caffe - Exception: Input blob arguments do not match net inputs
@CONTENT:I'm using Caffe for classifying non-image data using a quite simple CNN structure. I've had no problems training my network on my HDF5-data with dimensions n x 1 x 156 x 12. However, I'm having difficulties classifying new data. How do I do a simple forward pass without any preprocessing? My data has been normalized and have correct dimensions for Caffe (it's already been used to train the net). Below is my code and the CNN structure. EDIT: I've isolated the problem to the function '_Net_forward' in pycaffe.py and found that the issue arises as the self.input dict is empty. Can anyone explain why that is? The set is supposed to be equal to the set coming from the new test data: if set(kwargs.keys()) != set(self.inputs):
            raise Exception('Input blob arguments do not match net inputs.')
 My code has changed a bit as I now use the IO methods for converting the data into datum (see below). In that way I've filled the kwargs variable with the correct data. Even small hints would be greatly appreciated!     import numpy as np

@LINK:/questions/29124668/rendering-to-a-full-3d-render-target-in-one-pass
@TITLE:Rendering to a full 3D Render Target in one pass
@CONTENT:Using DirectX 11, I created a 3D volume texture that can be bound as a render target: D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC texDesc3d;
// ...
texDesc3d.Usage     = D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT;
texDesc3d.BindFlags = D3D11_BIND_RENDER_TARGET;

// Create volume texture and views
m_dxDevice->CreateTexture3D(&texDesc3d, nullptr, &m_tex3d);
m_dxDevice->CreateRenderTargetView(m_tex3d, nullptr, &m_tex3dRTView);
 I would now like to update the whole render target and fill it with procedural data generated in a pixel shader, similar to updating a 2D render target with a 'fullscreen pass'. Everything I need to generate the data is the UVW coordinates of the pixel in question. For 2D, a simple vertex shader that renders a full screen triangle can be built: struct VS_OUTPUT
{
    float4 position : SV_Position;
    float2 uv: TexCoord;
};

// input: three empty vertices
VS_OUTPUT main( uint vertexID : SV_VertexID )
{
    VS_OUTPUT result;
    result.uv = float2((vertexID << 1) & 2, vertexID & 2);
    result.position = float4(result.uv * float2(2.0f, -2.0f) + float2(-1.0f, 1.0f), 0.0f, 1.0f);
    return result;
}
 I have a hard time wrapping my head around how to adopt this principle for 3D. Is this even possible in DirectX 11, or do I have to render to individual slices of the volume texture as described here?

@TITLE:nohup doesn't work with OS X Yosmite - get error ¡§can't detach from console no such file or directory¡¨
@CONTENT:I use nohup to run a command from a php application (I have a web page that sends POST request to php server to start a shell script in background). It's something like exec('nohup /home/user/test.sh > /home/user/test.log 2>&1 &')
 This worked fine when I was using OS X Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6). However, recently I upgraded my MAC to OS X Yosemite (OS X 10.10) and now it doesn't work any more. In the test.log, I always get the message: nohup can't detach from console: no such file or directory. If I just run the same command in bash directly, it works fine. I did a lot of searching, but seems like I can't find anything useful for this issue. What I only see is a discussion regarding Jenkins, it seems like they also see similar issue. Anyone has any idea about why it starts to fail with Yosemite? Any input will be appreciated.

@TITLE:Is it useful to mark variables as volatile if they are shared across threads? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: When to use volatile with multi threading? 3 answers Notice! I'm obviously failing to make my point clearly to everyone here, and it's incredibly frustrating. My goal was to dispel the myth that volatile is effectively a no-op, that it does nothing. I was not trying to state that it should be used, that it is essential, that it is not redundant, etc. I have shown that volatile does still do a thing. I concede that it is redundant under certain circumstances, and that the multi-threaded example was a poor choice. I am also not trying to hide the fact that my answer's initial revisions contained errors. But this Q&A is not even coming close to fulfilling its intended purpose. To that end, I think it's time to chuck it away. Thanks to Kerrek and T.C. for their insights. I just don't think their responses fit the question that I wanted to ask. I'm sure that's my fault for asking it poorly. Therefore I am abandoning it! And closing it as a duplicate of the question not that it was intended as, but that it has been interpreted as. Cheers! (& hth.) I am writing to a variable in one thread and reading from it in another. I have been told that volatile is completely useless for this and that I do not need to use it in this day and age unless I am working with hardware. int x = 0;
void thread1()
{
   while (true) {
      sleep(1);
      if (x > 0)
         break;
   }
}

void thread2()
{
   while (true) {
      sleep(1);
      x++;
   }
}
 Do I gain anything by using volatile in this case? And how about if x is not a simple int but a class type?
@CODE:volatile volatile volatile int x = 0;

   while (true) {
      sleep(1);

@TITLE:DocumentDB call stored procedure from another stored procedure or itself
@CONTENT:Is there a way to recursively call stored procedures (or even UDFs if that will work) against DocumentDB documents? We have a document that looks something like this: {
  "docID" : "my_id",
  "owner" : "fred",
  "items" : [
    {
      "itemID" : "1",
      "type" : "item",
      "value" : 3
    },
    {
      "itemID" : "2",
      "type" : "group",
      "items" : [
        {
          "itemID" : "2.1",
          "type" : "group",
          "items" : [
            {
              "itemID" : "2.1.1",
              "type" : "item",
              "value" : 2
            },
            {
              "itemID" : "2.1.2",
              "type" : "item",
              "value" : 4
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "itemID" : "2.2",
          "type" : "item",
          "value" : 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
 Any time we have "items", that "items" array can contain entries that are a mix of "type" : "item" and "type" : "group". Entries that are of "type" : "item" have a simple "value" field that needs to be summed. Entries that are of "type" : "group" have an "items" array... and so on. In theory, there is no limit to the level of recursion, which I acknowledge is a problem, but in practice, the levels will rarely get below 4 or 5 deep. Pseudocode for what I'm trying to write looks something like this: function sumValues(items) {
    int total = 0;
    forEach(item in items) {
        if (item.type == "item") {
            total += item.value;
        } else {
            total += sumValues(item.items);
        }
    }
    return total;
}

function sumAllValues() {
  var ctx = getContext();
  var coll = ctx.getCollection();
  var response = ctx.getResponse();

  // query for docs by owner
  var filterQuery = 'SELECT * FROM Docs d where d.owner = \\\"fred\\\"';
  var done = coll.queryDocuments(coll.getSelfLink(), filterQuery, {},
    function (err, docs, options) {
      if (err) throw new Error ('Error' + err.message);

      var total = 0;
      docs.forEach(function(doc) {
        total += sumTotals(doc.items);
      });

      response.setBody('Total: ' + total);
    });
}
 Is this even possible? Does DocumentDB support calling a sproc from another sproc? Can a sproc call itself? I have found a few DocumentDB stored procedure references online, including this and this and this and this plus a host of other pages. If it's possible, I think I might have to somehow query the collection to get the sproc that I want to call, and then somehow reference the sproc, instead of just calling sumTotals() directly as you would with a standalone language. We're just starting to look at programming with DocumentDB, so we're not completely sure what we can do with it yet. Thanks for any assistance or advice.

@LINK:/questions/29104997/is-it-possible-to-pass-undeclared-variables-as-parameters-in-javascript
@TITLE:Is it possible to pass undeclared variables as parameters in Javascript?
@CONTENT:Let's say I have a variable myvar, and I don't have a variable myvar2. I can run the following without a problem: typeof myvar
// ? 'string'
typeof myvar2
// ? 'undefined'
 typeof and delete are the only functions I know of which don't throw errors when given an undefined parameter like this. I looked at the language spec for typeof and to my uninitiated eyes it seems to use internal functions like IsUnresolvableReference. Edit: I'd been working in a language that checks type with a synonymous function, and hadn't noticed typeof is actually an operator in JavaScript. I've removed parentheses from the code here but left the above as written. When I create a function: function myFunc(input_variable) {
  return("hello");
}
 ... as expected this throws a ReferenceError when passed myvar2 as a parameter, unless I run var myvar2;. If I wrap the return in a try/catch statement to handle the myvar2 not defined case, I still get the same error, as the variable seems to be checked for a resolvable reference upon entry into the function (upon runtime?) : function myFunc(input_var) {
  try {
    return "hello";
  } catch(error) {
    if (error.name === 'ReferenceError'){
      return "world";
    }
  }
}
 I was wondering how I can make a function that accepts unresolved references. My general guess is that, if it's a standard behaviour of functions, then perhaps I could modify some prototype for this construction specifically...? I'm aware prototypes are for objects, I'm wondering if this level of control over function is possible somehow? By way of context, I always find myself writing function(input_var) : if (typeof input_var == 'undefined' || my_settings.input_var_is_optional === true)
  var input_var = 'Sometimes variables are optional. This is my default value.';
  return dealWith(input_var);
} else if (typeof input_var == 'string') {
    return dealWith(input_var);
} else {
  // Already checked that input_var isn't optional, so we have a problem
  return false; // or throw a TypeError or something like that
}
 but the verbosity of all that plain puts me off writing type checking into my code, making it less robust to use functions more freely, or to pass onto other developers. I'd like to write a type handling function, e.g. For a function myFunc(input_var), if the variable passed in as parameter input_var has been defined, check if it's a string, else set it as "default_value". If it wasn't defined, also set it as "default_value", else it's a valid string, so just use input_var as is. ...but it's sabotaged by the fact that I can't actually pass anything in that's undefined, effectively stopping me from isolating this complexity in a separate function to which I could just pass 2 parameters: input_var (the real deal, not just its name), and expected_type. function typeTest(input_var, expected_type) {
  var is_optional_value = (typeof expected_type != 'undefined'
                                                 && expected_type === true);
  var optional_str = is_optional_value ? "|(undefined)" : ''
  var type_test_regex = RegExp('^(?!' + expected_type + optional_str + '$)');
  var is_expected_type = type_test_regex.test(typeof(input_var));
}
 For example, to check that an optional variable passed into a function was both defined, and was defined as a string, var myvar = 'abc'
//  myvar2 is never defined

// Mandatory type (expecting a string):
typeTest(myvar, 'string'); // true
// if (/^(?!string)$)/.test(typeof(myvar))
typeTest(myvar2, 'string'); // throws error

// Mandatory type (expecting a number):
typeTest(myvar, 'number'); // false
typeTest(myvar2, 'number'); // throws error

// Optional type ("expected is true"):
typeTest(myvar, true); // true
// if (/^(?!string|(undefined)$)/.test(typeof(myvar))
typeTest(myvar2, true); // throws error
@CODE:myvar myvar2 typeof myvar
// ? 'string'
typeof myvar2
// ? 'undefined' typeof delete typeof IsUnresolvableReference typeof function myFunc(input_variable) {
  return("hello");
} ReferenceError myvar2 var myvar2; try catch function myFunc(input_var) {
  try {
    return "hello";
  } catch(error) {
    if (error.name === 'ReferenceError'){
      return "world";
    }
  }

Following is the error, I'm getting it: Error CREATEing SolrCore 'testcore1': Unable to create core [testcore1] Caused by: Could not find configName for collection testcore1 found:null Note: I also seen Cloud tab on (ie. http://localhost:8983/solr/) left side of Solr UI and also don't know how it works? Meaning I don't know the location of the schema.xml, solrconfig.xml files due to lack of example folder (Collection1) and how to update those files? Is there any useful document or solution available to solve this error?

@TITLE:Are safari extensions subject to CSP?
@CONTENT:I was making a safari extension which injects iframes into webpages. On doing so, I came across an error. On some webpages, I get an error, Refused to frame 'safari-extension://abcdefgh/hello.html' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-src https: twitter:". I guess that this happens because safari extensions are subject to CSP. However, the same error is not seen in chrome extension when the iframe.src is set to a local file packaged in the extension. How can I resolve this issue? Also, does this have to do only with content-security-policy but also with X-Frame-Options?

@TITLE:javac classpath order contradicts Oracle documentation?
@CONTENT:In Sierra/Bates SCJP book page 797: "java and javac [...] first look in the directories that contain the classes that come standard with Java SE. Then they look in the directories defined by classpaths" Oracle documentation is stating the same order. (I know I shouldn't do that but...) To test this behaviour I implemented HashSet.java and Lol.java in directory: C:\dev\cmdline\TestProject\sources\java\util package java.util;
public class HashSet {}
 and package java.util;
import java.util.HashSet;
public class Lol {
    public static void main(String... x) {
        HashSet a = new HashSet();
        a.add("lol");
    }
}
 I get a compilation error when executing: C:\dev\cmdline\TestProject\sources>javac java/util/Lol.java java\util\Lol.java:6: error: cannot find symbol a.add("lol"); ^ symbol: method add(String) location: variable a of type HashSet ...which means that the default classpath (current directory) is first used. So, is the Oracle documentation wrong? How would you test the classpaths order?
@CODE:package java.util;
public class HashSet {} package java.util;
import java.util.HashSet;
public class Lol {
    public static void main(String... x) {

@TITLE:How to automatically play Playlist in Spotify Android app
@CONTENT:I'm trying to play a known playlist in the Spotify app. The best I've got is to load the playlist, but not play it. Two things I've tried. Firstly to play from search: Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.INTENT_ACTION_MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH);
intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.spotify.music",
    "com.spotify.music.MainActivity"));
intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS, 
    MediaStore.Audio.Playlists.ENTRY_CONTENT_TYPE);
intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_PLAYLIST, <PLAYLIST>);
intent.putExtra(SearchManager.QUERY, <PLAYLIST>);
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
context.startActivity(intent);
 I've tried replacing PLAYLIST with the name of a known playlist. Also tried things like "4Rj0zQ0Ux47upeqVSIuBx9", "spotify:user:11158272501:playlist:4Rj0zQ0Ux47upeqVSIuBx9" etc. All these do is a failed search for these strings. Second attempt is the View intent: String uri = "https://play.spotify.com/user/11158272501/playlist/4Rj0zQ0Ux47upeqVSIuBx9";
Intent intent= new Intent( Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(uri) );
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
context.startActivity(intent);
 This loads the playlist, but does not play. If I then use one of the many ways to send a KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY key, it just resumes the currently playing list, not this newly loaded list. Any help from anyone (including Spotify devs)? BTW I don't want to use the Spotify SDK to implement my own Spotify Player - it seems a shame to have to do this when a perfectly good player is already installed on a user's device.
@CODE:Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.INTENT_ACTION_MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH);
intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.spotify.music",
    "com.spotify.music.MainActivity"));

@LINK:/questions/28994567/postgresql-obtain-and-release-lock-inside-stored-function
@TITLE:PostgreSQL obtain and release LOCK inside stored function
@CONTENT:I have a function that needs to perform a long update on multiple large tables. During the update 2-3 tables at a time need to be locked in EXCLUSIVE mode. Since not all the tables need to be locked at the same time, ideally I'd want to LOCK only those tables I'm updating at the time, and then remove the lock once I'm done. Eg. -- Lock first pair of tables
LOCK TABLE tbl1_a IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
LOCK TABLE tbl1_b IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Perform the update on tbl1_a and tbl1_b

-- Release the locks on tbl1_a and tbl1_b
--  HOW???

-- Proceed to the next pair of tables
LOCK TABLE tbl2_a IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
LOCK TABLE tbl2_b IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
 Unfortunately, there's no the equivalent of UNLOCK statement in plpgsql. The normal way to remove LOCK is to COMMIT the transaction, but that is not possible inside a function. Is there any solution for this? Some way to explicitly release the lock before function is done? Or run some kind of sub-transaction (perhaps by running each update in a separate function)? UPDATE I accepted that there is no solution. I'll write each update into a separate function and coordinate from outside the db. Thanks everyone.
@CODE:-- Lock first pair of tables
LOCK TABLE tbl1_a IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
LOCK TABLE tbl1_b IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Perform the update on tbl1_a and tbl1_b

-- Release the locks on tbl1_a and tbl1_b
--  HOW???

template<typename T> void_t<typename T::foo> f();
f<int>(); // error, int does not have a nested type foo
 This is clear, but when I tried putting the void_t part in the parameter list it unexpectedly compiled: template<typename...> using void_t = void;
template<typename T> void f(void_t<typename T::foo>);
f<int>();
 It compiles on clang but not in gcc. Is this a bug?

 I have to call foo as foo(std::function<void(int, long, double, float)>(bar));
 which is too verbose. Even foo<int, long, double, float>(bar);
 would have been better. foo(bar);
 would be just ideal. Anyway, how can I make calls to foo to be less verbose? Edit: declaration of foo has to stay the same.

@TITLE:Adding value labels on a matplotlib bar chart
@CONTENT:I got stuck on something that feels like should be relatively easy. The code I bring below is a sample based on a larger project I'm working on. I saw no reason to post all the details, so please accept the data structures I bring as is. Basically, I'm creating a bar chart, and I just can figure out how to add value labels on the bars (in the center of the bar, or just above it). Been looking at samples around the web but with no success implementing on my own code. I believe the solution is either with 'text' or 'annotate', but I: a) don't know which one to use (and generally speaking, haven't figured out when to use which). b) can't see to get either to present the value labels. Would appreciate your help, my code below. Thanks in advance! import numpy as np

@TITLE:Spark MLlib / K-Means intuition
@CONTENT:I'm very new to machine learning algorithms and Spark. I'm follow the Twitter Streaming Language Classifier found here: http://databricks.gitbooks.io/databricks-spark-reference-applications/content/twitter_classifier/README.html Specifically this code: http://databricks.gitbooks.io/databricks-spark-reference-applications/content/twitter_classifier/scala/src/main/scala/com/databricks/apps/twitter_classifier/ExamineAndTrain.scala Except I'm trying to run it in batch mode on some tweets it pulls out of Cassandra, in this case 200 total tweets. As the example shows, I am using this object for "vectorizing" a set of tweets: object Utils{
  val numFeatures = 1000
  val tf = new HashingTF(numFeatures)

  /**
   * Create feature vectors by turning each tweet into bigrams of
   * characters (an n-gram model) and then hashing those to a
   * length-1000 feature vector that we can pass to MLlib.
   * This is a common way to decrease the number of features in a
   * model while still getting excellent accuracy (otherwise every
   * pair of Unicode characters would potentially be a feature).
   */
  def featurize(s: String): Vector = {
    tf.transform(s.sliding(2).toSeq)
  }
}
 Here is my code which is modified from ExaminAndTrain.scala:  val noSets = rawTweets.map(set => set.mkString("\n"))

val vectors = noSets.map(Utils.featurize).cache()
vectors.count()

val numClusters = 5
val numIterations = 30

val model = KMeans.train(vectors, numClusters, numIterations)

  for (i <- 0 until numClusters) {
    println(s"\nCLUSTER $i")
    noSets.foreach {
        t => if (model.predict(Utils.featurize(t)) == 1) {
          println(t)
        }
      }
    }
 This code runs and each Cluster prints "Cluster 0" "Cluster 1" etc with nothing printing beneath. If i flip models.predict(Utils.featurize(t)) == 1 
 to models.predict(Utils.featurize(t)) == 0
 the same thing happens except every tweet is printed beneath every cluster. Here is what I intuitively think is happening (please correct my thinking if its wrong): This code turns each tweet into a vector, randomly picks some clusters, then runs kmeans to group the tweets (at a really high level, the clusters, i assume, would be common "topics"). As such, when it checks each tweet to see if models.predict == 1, different sets of tweets should appear under each cluster (and because its checking the training set against itself, every tweet should be in a cluster). Why isn't it doing this? Either my understanding of what kmeans does is wrong, my training set is too small or I'm missing a step. Any help is greatly appreciated
@CODE:object Utils{
  val numFeatures = 1000

@TITLE:Add parameter to datatable ajax call before draw
@CONTENT:I am using DataTables 1.10 Does anyone know how to dynamically add a parameter to the ajax call before table.draw() so my request has new parameters? I've looked everywhere and cannot find an answer. I have buttons that a person can press and based on that button send different parameters to the server. $('#mytable').DataTable({
        iDisplayLength: 10,

        processing: true,
        serverSide: true,

@TITLE:How to handle specific hostname like -h option in Dockerfile
@CONTENT:I'm using CentOS 7 as docker daemon host and centos:6 Docker images. I want to install some software which requires resolvable hostname as non-loopback address. If I run a docker image with -h option like docker run -i -t -h myhost centos:6 /bin/bash
 Then I can install the software because /etc/hosts in the container automatically configured like [root@myhost /]# cat /etc/hosts

 But I cannot use same way if I create an image from Dockerfile. I tested creating an image using following Dockerfile FROM centos:6

ENV HOSTNAME myhost

@TITLE:(Python) How can I let a user open a text file and then change an integer / number
@CONTENT:I've asked a similar question but to no avail. I am a novice programming student and I've only been taught some basic techniques. Part of a task is to create a recipe program which I've mostly done, there is just one part preventing me from finishing. I am supposed to allow a user to call a previously created text file (I've done this bit), then after this the contents of this file should be displayed for them to see (I've also done this bit), however the user should be able to recalculate the servings and therefore change the quantity of the ingredients. So if the user entered: "I want 2 servings" and the original quantity for 1 serving was 100g it should now output 200g. It is really frustrating me and my teacher expects this work tomorrow. Below is what I am supposed to allow the user to do. The user should be able to retrieve the recipe and have the ingredients recalculated for a different number of people. ? The program should ask the user to input the number of people. ? The program should output: ? the recipe name ? the new number of people ? the revised quantities with units for this number of people. I will post my actual code below to show what I have done so far, which is to allow a user to view and make a new recipe. But the revised quantities bit is missing. I apologise if the code is messy or unorganised, I am new to this. Code so far: #!/usr/bin/env python

@TITLE:Higher-kinded types for multisets
@CONTENT:I would like to write a Multiset[T, S[_]] class in Scala, which takes 2 type parameters: T is the type of the element, whereas S is the underlying representation of the set. In this multiset, an instance of S[(T, Int)] is constructed (in each pair, T is the element and Int is its number of occurrence). This is possible in C++: template<typename T, template<typename> S>
 Two questions: How to declare the constraint on S that it must be a set? Does Multiset[T, S[_] <: Set[_]] work? Is it possible to declare the constraint that an instance of S[(T, Int)] can be instantiated? This can be done in C# using the where S: new() constraint.

@CONTENT:I am trying to raycast the mouse from my camera to do some hover and click events on meshes in my scene. My problem is, that my camera is currently the child object of another mesh (for easier camera movement/rotation) and now my raycasting doesn't work (I assume because the camera is a child of the mesh, and not the scene). This is parts of my code: //camera setup
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(60, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

var cameraTargetGeom = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5);
var cameraTargetMaterial = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({color: 0xff0000, ambient: 0xff0000});
var cameraTarget = new THREE.Mesh(cameraTargetGeom, cameraTargetMaterial);
cameraTarget.position.set(0.15, 0, 5);
scene.add(cameraTarget);
cameraTarget.add(camera);

camera.position.y = 18;
camera.rotation.x = Math.PI * -90 / 180;



// click event
renderer.domElement.addEventListener('click', clickedCanvas);

function clickedCanvas(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

 It was working fine before I added the camera to the cameraTarget object. How can I raycast from the camera now that it is a child of the cameraTarget?
@CODE://camera setup
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(60, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

var cameraTargetGeom = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5);
var cameraTargetMaterial = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({color: 0xff0000, ambient: 0xff0000});
var cameraTarget = new THREE.Mesh(cameraTargetGeom, cameraTargetMaterial);
cameraTarget.position.set(0.15, 0, 5);
scene.add(cameraTarget);
cameraTarget.add(camera);

camera.position.y = 18;
camera.rotation.x = Math.PI * -90 / 180;



// click event
renderer.domElement.addEventListener('click', clickedCanvas);

function clickedCanvas(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    mouse.x = (e.clientX / renderer.domElement.width) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(e.clientY / renderer.domElement.height) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

    var intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);
    console.log(intersects);

@TITLE:OSX Blocking JNLP Launch Java1.8U40 - Anyone Know Why?
@CONTENT:We deploy our application as a JNLP launch file and/or as a webpage applet. I have a customer that updated his MAC OSX system to the latest Java Version 1.8_40. After upgrading the JNLP launch stopped working. It seems to start Java (flashes blue java logo) then stops. No Exception is thrown. I suspect yet another OSX security hurdle. We adjusted his OSX Security settings to trust our application. We adjusted his Java security to trust our site. We also adjusted the Safari preferences to allow the application to run unrestricted ("unsafe mode"). The application is signed with a code signing certificate. The customer can use the Applet launch method using the safari Java plugin. All other customers (OSX & Windows) are generally fine. If this is a new MAC Java issue I'd like to get ahead of it. Anyone else out there see this? Any clues about what is causing the issue?

@TITLE:Best approach for Dependency Injection in Laravel 5 package
@CONTENT:I am developing a package for Laravel 5, and now I need to benefit from dependency injection to have a more scalable and relaible application, I don't know which approach is the best to take and why, this is a piece of my code and I need to injected the Lang class dependency  class MyController extends \App\Http\Controllers\Controller
 {        
    public $text;
    public $lang;

    public function __construct()
    {         
       // Some codes here                            
    }

    public function myFunction(){
       $this->text = \Lang::get('package::all.text1');           
     }
}
 In this link http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/ioc 2 approaches are suggested, Basic Usage and Automatic Resolution based on my understanding from the link taking the first approach I need to add  App::bind('lang', function($app)
{
    return new \Lang();
 });    
 to the register part of application and then in the function I'll have something like this :  public function myFunction()
{
  $lang = \App::make('lang');       
  $this->text = $lang::get('package::all.text1');           
 }
 The other way is to modify the constructor like   public function __construct(Lang $lang)
  {         
      $this->lang = $lang;
  }
 And then instantiate object from Class like   $myController = App::make('MyController');
 Which way is the better way to take for, considering that this class is a Controller and it will be called in the routes file, or please correct me if my understanding from the link is not right. please also inform me why you suggest any of those approaches.
@CODE:Lang class MyController extends \App\Http\Controllers\Controller
 {        
    public $text;
    public $lang;

    public function __construct()
    {         
       // Some codes here                            
    }

    public function myFunction(){
       $this->text = \Lang::get('package::all.text1');           
     }
} Basic Usage Automatic Resolution App::bind('lang', function($app)

 be better than if(condition):

@CONTENT:I am running WebLogic on JVM 1.7 with DCEVM (full implementation) and HotSwapAgent with custom plugin that gets triggered on every onClassLoad. I run into problems with Freemarker, which uses java.beans.Introspector. What I discovered is the fact that when I call Introspector.flushCaches on the method called by HotSwapAgent (through ReflectionCommand), then the BeanInfo in Introspector is invalidated properly (checked with debugger in that thread). However when I make request to the WLS appserver, then Introspector for the worker thread shows the old values! This seems like some thread-local implementation, but I was not able to find anything that would point to that assumption in java.beans.Introspector's documentation. Does anybody have any clue why this is happening and how to resolve that? Currently I store the information about reloaded classes in separate class and reload everything that's in that cache from the request thread, which works. Thanks for any clue.

@LINK:/questions/28761365/how-to-reject-and-properly-use-promises
@TITLE:How to reject (and properly use) Promises?
@CONTENT:Short story: Talking about Promises/A+, what is the proper way to reject a promise - throwing an error? But if I miss the catch - my whole app will blow! How to use promisify and what are the benefits of it (maybe you'll need to read the longer version)? Is .then(success, fail) really an anti-pattern and should I always use .then(success).catch(error)? Longer version, described as real life problem (would love someone to read): I have a library that uses Bluebird (A+ Promise implementation library), to fetch data from database (talking about Sequelize). Every query returns a result, but sometimes it's empty (tried to select something, but there wasn't any). The promise goes into the result function, because there is no reason for an error (not having results is not an error). Example: Entity.find(1).then(function(result) {
  // always ending here, despite result is {}
}).catch(function(error) {
  // never ends here
});
 I want to wrap this and check if the result is empty (can't check this everywhere in my code). I did this: function findFirst() {
  return Entity.find(1).then(function(result) {
    if (result) { // add proper checks if needed
      return result; // will invoke the success function
    } else {
      // I WANT TO INVOKE THE ERROR, HOW?! :)
    }
  }).catch(function(error) {
    // never ends here
  });
}

findFirst().then(function(result) {
  // I HAVE a result
}).catch(function(error) {
  // ERROR function - there's either sql error OR there is no result!
});
 If you are still with me - I hope you will understand what's up. I want somehow to fire up the error function (where "ERROR function" is). The thing is - I don't know how. I've tried these things: this.reject('reason'); // doesn't work, this is not a promise, Sequelize related
return new Error('reason'); // calls success function, with error argument
return false; // calls success function with false argument
throw new Error('reason'); // works, but if .catch is missing => BLOW!
 As you can see by my comments (and per spec), throwing an error works well. But, there's a big but - if I miss the .catch statement, my whole app blows up. Why I don't want this? Let's say I want to increment a counter in my database. I don't care about the result - I just make HTTP request.. So I can call incrementInDB(), which has the ability to return results (even for test reasons), so there is throw new Error if it failed. But since I don't care for response, sometimes I won't add .catch statement, right? But now - if I don't (on purpose or by fault) - I end up with your node app down. I don't find this very nice. Is there any better way to work it out, or I just have to deal with it? A friend of mine helped me out and I used a new promise to fix things up, like this: function findFirst() {
  var deferred = new Promise.pending(); // doesnt' matter if it's Bluebird or Q, just defer
  Entity.find(1).then(function(result) {
    if (result) { // add proper checks if needed
      deferred.resolve(result);
    } else {
      deferred.reject('no result');
    }
  }).catch(function(error) {
    deferred.reject('mysql error');
  );

  return deferred.promise; // return a promise, no matter of framework
}
 Works like a charm! But I got into this: Promise Anti Patterns - wiki article written by Petka Antonov, creator of Bluebird (A+ implementation). It's explicitly said that this is wrong. So my second question is - is it so? If yes - why? And what's the best way? Thanks a lot for reading this, I hope someone will spent time to answer it for me :) I should add that I didn't want to depend too much on frameworks, so Sequelize and Bluebird are just things that I ended up working with. My problem is with Promises as a global, not with this particular frameworks.
@CODE:catch promisify .then(success, fail) .then(success).catch(error) result Entity.find(1).then(function(result) {
  // always ending here, despite result is {}

  return Entity.find(1).then(function(result) {
    if (result) { // add proper checks if needed
      return result; // will invoke the success function
    } else {
      // I WANT TO INVOKE THE ERROR, HOW?! :)
    }

    // never ends here

@TITLE:Is there a bug in Internet Explorer 9/10 with innerHTML=¡§¡¨?
@CONTENT:I often use the following code to clear the content of an element : div.innerHTML = "";
 But I found a stange behaviour on Internet Explorer. It seems that all children of the div get their own children removed too! If I keep a reference to a child of the div above, after doing div.innerHTML = "";, the child's text node is no longer in the child. The following code is the proof of this behaviour (http://jsfiddle.net/Laudp273/): function createText() {
    var e = document.createElement("div");
    e.textContent = "Hello World!";
    return e;
}

var mrk = document.createElement("div");
mrk.appendChild(createText());
mrk.style.border = "4px solid yellow";

var container = null;

function addDiv() {
    if (container) {
        container.innerHTML = "";
    }
    var e = document.createElement("div");
    e.appendChild(mrk);
    container = e;
    document.body.appendChild(e);
}

var btn = document.createElement("button");
btn.textContent = "Add marker";
btn.addEventListener(
    "click",
    function() {
        addDiv();
    },
    false
);
document.body.appendChild(btn);
 If you click on the "Add Marker" button twice, you will see an empty yellow rectangle instead of one with the texte "Hello wordl!". Is this a bug or a specification not used by Firefox nor Google Chrome?
@CODE:div.innerHTML = ""; div.innerHTML = ""; function createText() {
    var e = document.createElement("div");
    e.textContent = "Hello World!";
    return e;
}

var mrk = document.createElement("div");
mrk.appendChild(createText());

I subclass UIView, to make my custom generic view for my app, and then I subclass this custom view. Now some of my subclasses override some method from UIView and some don't. I only want to call this method if it is actually overridden, I do not want the default UIView method being called. Is there a way to check this, i.e. with a method similar to respondsToSelector:? Edit: This question is different from the one asked in Objective-C detect if class overrides inherited method because I do not really know or do not want to care which superclass originally implements the method.

@LINK:/questions/28724105/deleting-a-camera-roll-asset-using-photos-framework
@TITLE:deleting a camera roll asset using Photos framework
@CONTENT:I'm writing a test application to see if it is possible to delete a "photo library" asset in iOS 8, using the Photos framework. Although I suspect it is not possible, I find the documentation to be unclear, and there are posts on this site that seem to indicate it is possible. See here for example. In my test app, I pick an asset from the library: var picker = UIImagePickerController()
picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary
picker.mediaTypes = [kUTTypeMovie]
 In the delegate callback, I get the NSURL of the asset, and put it into an array: let thePicked = info[UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL] as NSURL!
var videosToDelete: [NSURL] = [theURL]
 And here is the part I'm least confident about, where I get the PhotoLibrary, and do a change request to delete the asset: PHPhotoLibrary.sharedPhotoLibrary().performChanges( {
    let assetToDelete = PHAsset.fetchAssetsWithALAssetURLs(videosToDelete, options: nil)
    PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(assetToDelete)
},
    completionHandler: { success, error in
        NSLog("Finished deleting asset. %@", (success ? "Success" : error))
})
 The completion handler returns successfully, but the asset is never deleted. Am I doing something wrong? Or am I trying to do something inherently not allowed, and I'm not receiving the correct feedback for it?
@CODE:var picker = UIImagePickerController()
picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary
picker.mediaTypes = [kUTTypeMovie] let thePicked = info[UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL] as NSURL!
var videosToDelete: [NSURL] = [theURL] PHPhotoLibrary.sharedPhotoLibrary().performChanges( {
    let assetToDelete = PHAsset.fetchAssetsWithALAssetURLs(videosToDelete, options: nil)
    PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(assetToDelete)

 So, as you can see, it gets pretty long, pretty fast. I was thinking about shortening these ObjectIds. Idea is that I should add new field called "shortId" to every model in my database. So instead of having: var CompanySchema = mongoose.Schema({
  /* _id will be added automatically by mongoose */
  name:         {type: String},
  address:      {type: String},
  directorName: {type: String}
});
 we would have this: var CompanySchema = mongoose.Schema({
  /* _id will be added automatically by mongoose */
  shortId:      {type: String}, /* WE SHOULD ADD THIS */
  name:         {type: String},
  address:      {type: String},
  directorName: {type: String},
});
 I found a way to do it like this: // Encode
var b64 = new Buffer('47cc67093475061e3d95369d', 'hex')
  .toString('base64')
  .replace('+','-')
  .replace('/','_')
;
// -> shortID is now: R8xnCTR1Bh49lTad
 But I still think it could be shorter. Also, I found this npm module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/short-mongo-id but I don't see it's being used too much so I can't tell if it's reliable. Anyone has any suggestions?

@CONTENT:I've worked with OpenCV Stitching for a while. Now I want to do the last step of stitching: crop image. This leads to find the largest inscribed axis-parallel rectangle in general polygon. I've already googled it and found some answers (How do I crop to largest interior bounding box in OpenCV?). The quality of output image is good despite the program run slowly (it takes 15 sec to crop image quite takes only 47 sec to stitch 36 1600x1200 pictures into 1 panorama) since the used algorithm have bad time complexity (for each point in the contour, it scan all point in same row/column). Any way to improve this? Thanks.

@TITLE:AngularJS: Memory Leak with ng-repeat using custom objects (w/simple PLUNKR)
@CONTENT:(simple plunkr demo here) SUMMARY: There is a leak using ng-repeat after the 2nd wave iterating over an 'array' of custom objects like this :     <div ng-repeat="d_sampleObject in mySampleObjects">
        {{d_sampleObject.description}}
    </div>
 Memory profile reveals an extra 'd_sampleObject' left over and not de-referenced. More details (via a controller and an injected service) below. A simple demonstration also in the provided plunkr link. Any thoughts and help greatly appreciated in advance! NOTE: 'mySampleObjects' is an array of the following instances:         ml.MySampleObject = function (id) {

            this.id = id;
            this.description = 'this is object #:' + ' '+id;
        }
 DETAILS: I have a custom object model that reflects the business domain objects that we utilize in our AngularJS app. I have found that when I pass an instance of one of my custom objects to ng-repeat, a reference is kept to it (I think by Angular) and memory is not freed. This happens on the second 'wave' (click on 'refresh') of the ng-repeat as it iterates, again, over its array of objects. This leak is exposed in my Profile tests (in Chrome) . Here is a short example in plunkr. Click on 'refresh' button once (or more) to see the extra 'd_sampleObject' object instance that is leaked (in Chrome Profile Inspection). Note, the 'd_sampleObject' name is only used when passed to ng-repeat. I have included screenshots of the extra object instance ('d_sampleObject') that is being leaked further below. Why is there a leak and how can it be avoided? (Note, I have found if I don't iterate over my object collection (JS array) thru an object but rather thru a primitive index ('integer'), there is no leak. The leak seems to only happen when I use an object reference as a result of ng-repeat iterations) SIMPLE HTML: <!DOCTYPE html>
