@TITLE:Do redundant casts get optimized?
@CONTENT:I am updating some old code, and have found several instances where the same object is being cast repeatedly each time one of its properties or methods needs to be called. Example: if (recDate != null && recDate > ((System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker)ctrl).MinDate)
{
    ((System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker)ctrl).CustomFormat = "MM/dd/yyyy";
    ((System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker)ctrl).Value = recDate;
}
else
{
    (System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker)ctrl).CustomFormat = " ";
}
((System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker)ctrl).Format = DateTimePickerFormat.Custom;
 My inclination is to fix this monstrosity, but given my limited time I don't want to bother with anything that's not affecting functionality or performance. So what I'm wondering is, are these redundant casts getting optimized away by the compiler? I tried figuring it out myself by using ildasm on a simplified example, but not being familiar with IL I only ended up more confused. UPDATE So far, the consensus seems to be that a)no, the casts are not optimized, but b)while there may possibly be some small performance hit as a result, it is not likely significant, and c)I should consider fixing them anyway. I have come down on the side of resolving to fix these someday, if I have time. Meanwhile, I won't worry about them. Thanks everyone!

}
else
{
    (System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker)ctrl).CustomFormat = " ";

@LINK:/questions/4740806/native-way-to-merge-objects-in-javascript
@TITLE:Native way to merge objects in Javascript
@CONTENT:Javascript's Object doesn't have any native merge operation. If you have two objects, say {a:1, b:2}
{c:3, d:4}
 And want to get {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
 As far as I know, you have to iterate through the objects. That is to say that you decide on either a merge left or merge right strategy and then you do something like (simplified) for (key in object2) {
  object1[key] = object2[key];
}
 This is fine. However, Javascript has the call and prototype feature. For instance, turning arguments into an Array can be done with Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) This approach exploits existing native code, and so therefore is less susceptible to programmer folly and should run faster than a non-native implementation. The question Is there a trick to use this prototype/call pattern on perhaps the Attribute or Node traversal features of the DOM, or perhaps some of the generic String functions in order to do a native object merge? The code would look something like this: var merged = somethingrandom.obscuremethod.call(object1, object2) And as a result, you'd get a native merge without a traversal. A possible, sub-optimal solution If you could use the constructor property of an Object and then coerce one object to have a constructor of another object and then run new over the composite object, you may get a merge for free. But I don't have a firm grasp of the full implications of the constructor feature in javascript to make this call. Lemma The same question holds true for Arrays. A common problem is to take, say 7 arrays of numbers, then try to find out the intersection of those arrays. That is to say, which numbers exist in all 7 arrays. You could concat them together, then do a sort, and then do a traversal, surely. But it would be nice if there is a generic intersect tucked away somewhere that we can coerce an array to doing natively. Any thoughts? edit: Getting half way there For the array problem, you could do the following: array.concat(a, b, c).sort().join(':') and then use some tricky RegExp capture and repeat patterns in order to traverse. RegExp implementations, if you don't know, run on a very simple stack-based virtual machine. When you initialize your regular expression that's really a program that gets compiled (RegExp.compile is a deprecated JS method). Then the native runs over the string in a blisteringly fast way. Perhaps you could exploit that for membership thresholds and get better performance... It still doesn't go all the way though.
@CODE:{a:1, b:2}
{c:3, d:4} {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4} for (key in object2) {
  object1[key] = object2[key];
} call prototype arguments Array Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) Attribute Node String var merged = somethingrandom.obscuremethod.call(object1, object2) constructor Object new constructor Arrays RegExp

@LINK:/questions/8308812/why-is-c11-constexpr-so-restrictive
@TITLE:Why is C++11 constexpr so restrictive?
@CONTENT:As you probably know, C++11 introduces the constexpr keyword. C++11 introduced the keyword constexpr, which allows the user to guarantee that a function or object constructor is a compile-time constant. [...] This allows the compiler to understand, and verify, that [function name] is a compile-time constant. My question is why are there such strict restrictions on form of the functions that can be declared. I understand desire to guarantee that function is pure, but consider this: The use of constexpr on a function imposes some limitations on what that function can do. First, the function must have a non-void return type. Second, the function body cannot declare variables or define new types. Third, the body may only contain declarations, null statements and a single return statement. There must exist argument values such that, after argument substitution, the expression in the return statement produces a constant expression. That means that this pure function is illegal: constexpr int maybeInCppC1Y(int a, int b)
{
    if (a>0)
        return a+b;
    else
        return a-b;
  //can be written as   return  (a>0) ? (a+b):(a-b); but that isnt the point
}
 Also you cant define local variables... :( So I'm wondering is this a design decision, or do compilers suck when it comes to proving function a is pure?

If I type git checkout master (as I see in alot of tutorials or guides), I get error: pathspec 'master' did not match any file(s) known to git.

The code is to get the idea of what I'm trying to do across: ie. I want to be able to have table rows that are created using ng-repeat whose class is also based on a condition which depends on access to the scoped feature of row itself eg. person. I realise I could just add ng-class on the columns but that is boring. Anyone have any better ideas?

 is always called with begin == -1 and rows == -1, instead of getting real values to page through. In addition: public boolean useFillPage(List fillParameters)

    width : "1065px",
    height : "600px"

}
 Beyond that, I have other behaviors, logic, and a 'default' group of settings (which get overwritten by more specific ones). What I'm trying to do is push all the appropriate settings, from multiple objects, into a single Object so I can just call: $(this).colorbox(Settings);
 How would I transfer an unknown group of properties and their values (for example "width" and "height") from something like Type.video into Settings? The goal is to be able to call Settings.height and get back the value I pushed in.
@CODE:$(this).colorbox({
    width : "500px",
    height : "500px"
}); var Type = {
  video: {
    width : "500px",
    height : "500px"
  },
  gallery: {
    width : "1065px",
    height : "600px"
  }
} $(this).colorbox(Settings);

@TITLE:Is ¡§transaction.atomic¡¨ same as ¡§transaction.commit_on_success¡¨?
@CONTENT:Django 1.6 proposes @transaction.atomic as part of the rehaul in the transaction management from 1.5. I have a function which is called by a Django management command which is in turn called by cron, i.e. no HTTP request triggering transactions in this case. Snippet: from django.db import transaction

@transaction.commit_on_success
def my_function():
    # code here
 In the above code block commit_on_success uses a single transaction for all the work done in my_function. Does replacing @transaction.commit_on_success with @transaction.atomic result in the identical behaviour? @transaction.atomic docs state: Atomicity is the defining property of database transactions. atomic allows us to create a block of code within which the atomicity on the database is guaranteed. If the block of code is successfully completed, the changes are committed to the database. If there is an exception, the changes are rolled back. I take it that they result in the same behaviour; correct?

@TITLE:How to return dictionary keys as a list in Python 3.3
@CONTENT:I noticed something very weird - or let's say, something that is very different from Python 2.7 and older versions of Python 3 I believe. Previously, I could get dictionary keys, values, or items of a dictionary very easily as list: PYTHON 2.7
>>> newdict = {1:0, 2:0, 3:0}
>>> newdict
{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}
>>> newdict.keys()
[1, 2, 3]
 Now, I get something like this in PYTHON 3.3.0
>>> newdict.keys()
dict_keys([1, 2, 3])
 I am wondering if there is a way to return a list as I showed it in the Python 2.7 example. Because now, I have to do something like newlist = list()
for i in newdict.keys():
    newlist.append(i)
 EDIT: Thanks, list(newdict.keys()) works as I wanted! But there is another thing that bugs me now: I want to create a list of reversed dictionary keys and values to sort them by values. Like so (okay, this is a bad example, because the values are all 0 here) >>> zip(newdict.values(), newdict.keys())
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]
 However, in Python3 I get something like >>> zip(list(newdict.keys()), list(newdict.values()))
<zip object at 0x7f367c7df488>
 Okay, sorry, I just figured out that you have to use a list() function around zip() too. list(zip(newdict.values(), newdict.keys()))
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]
 This is really something one has to get used to
@CODE:PYTHON 2.7
>>> newdict = {1:0, 2:0, 3:0}
>>> newdict
{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}
>>> newdict.keys()
[1, 2, 3] PYTHON 3.3.0
>>> newdict.keys()
dict_keys([1, 2, 3]) newlist = list()
for i in newdict.keys():
    newlist.append(i) list(newdict.keys()) >>> zip(newdict.values(), newdict.keys())
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)] >>> zip(list(newdict.keys()), list(newdict.values()))
<zip object at 0x7f367c7df488> list() zip() list(zip(newdict.values(), newdict.keys()))
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)] sorted(newdict.items(),key=lambda x: x[1]) newdict.items() sorted key

 I tried these:  watcher.Filter = "*.txt|*.doc|*.docx|*.xls|*.xlsx";

 Both did not work. This is just basics but I miss it. Thanks..

@TITLE:Capturing the Enter key in a TextBox
@CONTENT:In my WPF view, I am trying to tie an event to the Enter key as follows: <TextBox Width="240" VerticalAlignment="Center" Margin="2" Text="{Binding SearchCriteria, Mode=OneWayToSource}">
  <TextBox.InputBindings>
      <KeyBinding Key="Enter" Command="{Binding EnterKeyCommand}"/>
      <KeyBinding Key="Tab" Command="{Binding TabKeyCommand}"/>
  </TextBox.InputBindings>
</TextBox>
 This code works and my EnterKeyCommand fires when the users presses the Enter key. However, the problem is that when the event fires, WPF hasn't yet bound the text in the textbox to 'SearchCriteria'. So when my event fires, the contents of 'SearchCriteria' is blank. Is there a simple change I can make in this code so that I can get the contents of the textbox when my EnterKey command fires?
@CODE:<TextBox Width="240" VerticalAlignment="Center" Margin="2" Text="{Binding SearchCriteria, Mode=OneWayToSource}">

@TITLE:Why does Python raise TypeError rather than SyntaxError?
@CONTENT:A question purely for curiosity's sake. This is obviously invalid syntax: foo = {}
foo['bar': 'baz']
 It's obvious what happened, the developer moved a line out of the dictionary definition but didn't change it from the literal dictionary declaration to the assignment syntax (and has been suitably mocked as a result). But my question is, why does Python raise TypeError: unhashable type here rather than SyntaxError? What type is it attempting to hash? Just doing this: 'bar': 'baz'
 is a SyntaxError, as is this: ['bar': 'baz']
 so I can't see what type is being created that is unhashable.

#error Data structure doesn't match page size
#endif
 The exact thing I'm checking here is completely made up - the point is, I often like to put in these types of (size or alignment) compile-time checks to guard against someone modifying a data-structure which could misalign or re-size things which would break them. Needless to say - I don't appear to be able to use a sizeof in the manner described above.

@TITLE:ListPreference: use string-array as Entry and integer-array as Entry Values doesn't work
@CONTENT:I'm using in a settings.xml file a ListPreference. I want to show the user a list of 3 options to select. When the user chooses one of the options in the Settings, I get this error: 07-05 16:31:25.117: E/AndroidRuntime(30415): FATAL EXCEPTION: main

 This is the code of the ListPreference: <ListPreference
    android:entries="@array/date_alignement"
    android:entryValues="@array/date_alignement_values"
    android:key="settings_date_alignement"
    android:summary="@string/settings_date_alignement_summary"
    android:title="@string/settings_date_alignement_title" />
 And here are the arrays I use to populate the entries: <string-array name="date_alignement">
    <item>"Top"</item>
    <item>"Center"</item>
    <item>"Bottom"</item>
</string-array>
<integer-array name="date_alignement_values">
    <item >0</item>
    <item >1</item>
    <item >2</item>
</integer-array>
 In my onSharedPreferenceChanged I use those values in this way: @Override
public void onSharedPreferenceChanged(
            SharedPreferences sharedPreferences, String key) {          

        //Text
        mAlignment =  mPrefs.getInt(PREF_ALIGNMENT, 1);
        switch (mAlignment) {
        case 0:
            offsetY = mHeight/3.0f;
            break;

        case 2:
            offsetY = mHeight*2.0f/3.0f;
            break;

        default:
            offsetY = mHeight/2.0f;
            break;
        }
 } If I use another string-array for the entryValues it works. For example if I use the same string array as values and entries:     android:entries="@array/date_alignement"
    android:entryValues="@array/date_alignement"
 then I have to change my code a little but it works:         if(mAlignment.equalsIgnoreCase("center")) {
            offsetY = mHeight/2.0f;
        } else if(mAlignment.equalsIgnoreCase("top")) {
            offsetY = mHeight/3.0f;
        } else if(mAlignment.equalsIgnoreCase("bottom")) {
            offsetY = mHeight*2.0f/3.0f;
        }
 Why I can't use a string-array and an integer-array for a ListPreference entries and values?

@CONTENT:I use startx to start X which will evaluate my .xinitrc. In my .xinitrc I start my window manager using /usr/bin/mywm. Now, if I kill my WM (in order to f.e. test some other WM), X will terminate too because the .xinitrc script reached EOF. So I added this at the end of my .xinitrc: while true; do sleep 10000; done
 This way X won't terminate if I kill my WM. Now my question: how can I do an infinite sleep instead of looping sleep? Is there a command which will kinda like freeze the script? Best regards

@TITLE:How to control docking order in WinForms
@CONTENT:As the title states, I'm looking for a way to control the order in which the items dock to the top of my control. I've played with the windows form designer, and i cant seem to find what the RightClick->Order->SendToFront is doing, because thats exactly what I want to happen. As far as I can get to happen, as I add my contents to my control, the newest contents is always at the top, and I'd like for the Newer contents to be on the bottom, and the oldest contents to be at the top. Summary: Is there an easy way in WinForms (C#), to control the order in which things dock to the sides of controls? Edit: I have to do this from the code behind as i add my controls, I can't use any features of the WinForm's designer, but what I am trying to do, is mimic the WinForms Designer SendToBack and SendToFront features

@CONTENT:I am not sure what is going on but I keep getting the following exception when doing a query. "Duplicate type name within an assembly." I have not been able to find a solution on the web. I had resolved the issue by removing entity framework from all the projects in the solutions and re-installing using nugget. Then all of the sudden the exception is back.

But i still dont get the pros of this.. do I skip alot of unnecessary things in the IIS pipe by using owin which speeds the application up, or.. whats the actual pros?

The problem is that the "UIViewController subclass" does not appear in the file template library. My book and every page I checked has this template under iOS or Mac "Cocoa touch" category. My xcode only shows "Objective-C Class" "Objective-C Category" "Objective-C Class Extension" "Objective-C protocol" "Objective-C Test Case Class" How can I add a new file template of UIViewController subclass ? My environments: - Snow Leopard - xcode version: 4.3 Thanks in advance!

@CONTENT:So I've come to like and enjoy using Google Test for a C++ project I'm involved in. I'm just bringing up a new project that will be straight C (a library) and so far can't see any reason why not to continuing using Google Test, even though its a C++ framework. Having a C++ compiler available will not be an issue. Are there are specific reasons why I shouldn't use Google Test for testing straight C code? Thanks.

@TITLE:Possible to delete a breakpoint for good when debugging?
@CONTENT:When debugging, changes to breakpoints are only persisted for that debugging session. Once the debugger detaches the breakpoints are restored to their 'pre-debug' state. I can appreciate this is sometimes useful, and understand why it defaults this way. However - does anyone know if there is an option to disable this functionality (in VS2010) such that if I delete/disable/add a breakpoint during debugging the changes will persist the next time I start debugging?

 where <CR> mean hit the ENTER key and | is the position of the cursor. This is what Eclipse does. It's what Visual Studio does. And it's what I want Vim to do. I've seen a few plugins, tried a few, and none of them seem to give me this behavior. Surely I can't be the first programmer to want this.

@CONTENT:When I try to set a longish worksheet name using ruby and win32ole with the following code: require "win32ole"
excel = WIN32OLE.new('Excel.Application')
excel.Visible = 1

workbook = excel.Workbooks.Add

worksheet1.Name = "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism" #Length 30, fine
worksheet2 = workbook.Worksheets.Add
worksheet2.Name = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" #Length 34, not fine
 I get the following: 12.0

    OLE error code:800A03EC in Microsoft Office Excel
      You typed an invalid name for a sheet or chart. Make sure that:

 The version 12.0 indicates that I'm running Excel 2007, but it's complaining that the worksheet name is too long. I had a look at Excel 2007 specifications and limits as mentioned in this related answer, and I couldn't find it mentioning any such limit. (Trying to rename a worksheet manually suggests there may be such a limit, however) Is there a limit, and is it a hard limit or one that can be changed by changing the configuration of Excel?

@TITLE:.NET 4.0 code contracts - How will they affect unit testing?
@CONTENT:For example this article introduces them. What is the benefit? Static analysis seems cool but at the same time it would prevent the ability to pass null as a parameter in unit test. (if you followed the example in the article that is) While on the topic of unit testing - given how things are now surely there is no point for code contracts if you already practice automated testing? Update Having played with Code Contracts I'm a little disappointed. For example, based on the code in the accepted answer: public double CalculateTotal(Order order)
{
    Contract.Requires(order != null);
    Contract.Ensures(Contract.Result<double>() >= 0);
    return 2.0;
}
 For unit testing, you still have to write tests to ensure that null cannot be passed, and the result is greater than or equal to zero if the contracts are business logic. In other words, if I was to remove the first contract, no tests would break, unless I had specifically had a test for this feature. This is based on not using the static analysis built into the better (ultimate etc...) editions of Visual Studio however. Essentially they all boil down to an alternate way of writing traditional if statements. My experience actually using TDD, with Code Contracts shows why, and how I went about it.
@CODE:public double CalculateTotal(Order order)
{
    Contract.Requires(order != null);
    Contract.Ensures(Contract.Result<double>() >= 0);

@TITLE:C++ standard library - when should I use it and when shouldn't I?
@CONTENT:I was wondering how often people actually use much of the standard c++ library, particularly the stuff in the <algorithm> and <numeric> headers. The text books seem to recommend them, but I haven't seen any of them used at all in various projects I've sifted through (coincidence?) and personally it seems easier to just write appropriate simple algorithms myself each time rather than memorize or consult a reference to these headers each time. Am just being lazy or stubborn? Is there actually performance gains etc when using these libraries? Thanks, R

 I need this value to make a file filter that filters out files that are bigger than 4294967296 bytes (4GB). The other way round works without any issues (long size = file.length()) with every file size, which is why I can't figure out why my declaration is not working.

@TITLE:Javascript semaphore / test-and-set / lock?
@CONTENT:Is there such a thing as an atomic test-and-set, semaphore, or lock in Javascript? I have javascript invoking async background processes via a custom protocol (the background process literally runs in a separate process, unrelated to the browser). I believe I'm running into a race condition; the background process returns between my test and my set, screwing things up on the javascript side. I need a test-and-set operation to make it a real semaphore. Here's the javascript code that attempts to detect background processes and queue them up: Call = function () {

var isRunning = true,
    queue = [];

return  {
    // myPublicProperty: "something",

    call: function (method) {
            if (isRunning) {
                console.log("Busy, pushing " + method);
                queue.push(method);
            } else {
                isRunning = true;
                objccall(method);
            }
        },

        done: function() {
            isRunning = false;
            if (queue.length > 0) {
                Call.call(queue.shift());
            }
        }
    };
}();
 Call is a singleton that implements the queuing; anybody that wants to invoke an external process does Call.call("something") . Any ideas?
@CODE:Call = function () {

var isRunning = true,
    queue = [];

return  {
    // myPublicProperty: "something",

    call: function (method) {
            if (isRunning) {

@TITLE:Convert numpy array to tuple
@CONTENT:Note: This is asking for the reverse of the usual tuple-to-array conversion. I have to pass an argument to a (wrapped c++) function as a nested tuple. For example, the following works X = MyFunction( ((2,2),(2,-2)) )
 whereas the following do not X = MyFunction( numpy.array(((2,2),(2,-2))) )
X = MyFunction( [[2,2],[2,-2]] )
 Unfortunately, the argument I would like to use comes to me as a numpy array. That array always has dimensions 2xN for some N, which may be quite large. Is there an easy way to convert that to a tuple? I know that I could just loop through, creating a new tuple, but would prefer if there's some nice access the numpy array provides. If it's not possible to do this as nicely as I hope, what's the prettiest way to do it by looping, or whatever?

@TITLE:Specify width in *characters*
@CONTENT:When using a fixed width font, I'd like to specify the width of an HTML element in characters. The "em" unit is supposed to be the width of the M character, so I should be able to use it to specify a width. This is an example: <html>
  <head>
    <style>
      div {
        font-family: Courier;
        width: 10em;
      }

  <body>
    <div>
      1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
 The result is not what I wanted as the browser line breaks after column 15, not 10: 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5
7 9 1
 (Result in Firefox and Chromium, both in Ubuntu.) Wikipedia's article says that an "em" is not always the width of an M, so it definitely looks like the "em" unit can't be trusted for this.
@CODE:<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      div {
        font-family: Courier;

@CONTENT:Let's say that during your workday you repeatedly encounter the following form of columnized output from some command in bash (in my case from executing svn st in my Rails working directory): ?       changes.patch
M       app/models/superman.rb
A       app/models/superwoman.rb
 in order to work with the output of your command - in this case the filenames - some sort of parsing is required so that the second column can be used as input for the next command. What I've been doing is to use awk to get at the second column, e.g. when I want to remove all files (not that that's a typical usecase :), I would do: svn st | awk '{print $2}' | xargs rm
 Since I type this a lot, a natural question is: is there a shorter (thus cooler) way of accomplishing this in bash? NOTE: What I am asking is essentially a shell command question even though my concrete example is on my svn workflow. If you feel that workflow is silly and suggest an alternative approach, I probably won't vote you down, but others might, since the question here is really how to get the n-th column command output in bash, in the shortest manner possible. Thanks :)

@CONTENT:I am creating a script that will be run in a MS SQL server. This script will run multiple statements and needs to be transactional, if one of the statement fails the overall execution is stopped and any changes are rolled back. I am having trouble creating this transactional model when issuing ALTER TABLE statements to add columns to a table and then updating the newly added column. In order to access the newly added column right away, I use a GO command to execute the ALTER TABLE statement, and then call my UPDATE statement. The problem I am facing is that I cannot issue a GO command inside an IF statement. The IF statement is important within my transactional model. This is a sample code of the script I am trying to run. Also notice that issuing a GO command, will discard the @errorCode variable, and will need to be declared down in the code before being used (This is not in the code below). BEGIN TRANSACTION

DECLARE @errorCode INT
SET @errorCode = @@ERROR

-- **********************************

I would like whole sections to have a #region-like thing and collapse them (e.g. my <Window.CommandBindings>, <Grid.*Definitions>, <Menu>, <Toolbar>, etc.. Does this exist? If not, how about <RegionCollapse>

@TITLE:Orderby() not ordering numbers correctly c#
@CONTENT:I am writing an app for my company and am currently working on the search functionality. When a user searches for an item, I want to display the highest version (which is stored in a database). The problem is, the version is stored as a string instead of int, and when I do an OrderBy(q=>q.Version) on the results, they are returned like 1
10
11
2
3
...
 Obviously 2 comes before 10. Is there a way for me to cast the version as an integer or is there a simple IComparer out there? I couldn't find anything substantial thus far. I tried doing this: var items = (from r in results
             select r).OrderBy(q => Int32.Parse(q.Version));
 This compiles but doesn't work.
@CODE:1
10
11
2

... var items = (from r in results
             select r).OrderBy(q => Int32.Parse(q.Version)); q => int.Parse(q.Version) (q => Int32.Parse(q.Version)) (q => Int32.Parse(q)) Version int.Parse OrderBy

@TITLE:WPF Combobox DisplayMemberPath
@CONTENT:Ok, I looked at other questions and didn't seem to get my answer so hopefully someone here can. Very simple question why does the DisplayMemberPath property not bind to the item? <ComboBox Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="2" ItemsSource="{Binding PromptList}" DisplayMemberPath="{Binding Name}" SelectedItem="{Binding Prompt}"/>
 The trace output shows that it is trying to bind to the class holding the IEnumerable not the actual item in the IEnumerable. I'm confused as to a simple way to fill a combobox without adding a bunch a lines in xaml. It simply calls the ToString() for the object in itemssource. I have a work around which is this: <ComboBox Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="2" ItemsSource="{Binding PromptList}"  SelectedItem="{Binding Prompt}">
    <ComboBox.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}"/>
        </DataTemplate>
    </ComboBox.ItemTemplate>
</ComboBox>
 But in my opinion it's too much for such a simple task. Can I use a relativesource binding?
@CODE:<ComboBox Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="2" ItemsSource="{Binding PromptList}" DisplayMemberPath="{Binding Name}" SelectedItem="{Binding Prompt}"/> <ComboBox Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="2" ItemsSource="{Binding PromptList}"  SelectedItem="{Binding Prompt}">

@TITLE:Is custom enum Serializable too?
@CONTENT:I understand Enum is Serializable. Hence, it is safe to do so. (selectedCountry is enum Country) Original enum without customer member variables public enum Country {
    Australia,
    Austria,
    UnitedState;
}
 Fragment @Override
public void onActivityCreated (Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);
    if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        selectedCountry = (Country)savedInstanceState.getSerializable(SELECTED_COUNTRY_KEY);
    }
}

@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    savedInstanceState.putSerializable(SELECTED_COUNTRY_KEY, selectedCountry);
}
 However, what if I have non-serializable members in custom enum class? For instance, Original enum customer member variables package org.yccheok;

import org.yccheok.R;

/**
 *
 * @author yccheok
 */
public enum Country {
    Australia(R.drawable.flag_au),
    Austria(R.drawable.flag_at),
    UnitedState(R.drawable.flag_us);

    Country(int icon) {
        this.icon = icon;
        nonSerializableClass = new NonSerializableClass(this.toString());
    }

    public int getIcon() {
        return icon;
    }

    public static class NonSerializableClass {
        public NonSerializableClass(String dummy) { this.dummy = dummy; }
        public String dummy;
    }

    private final int icon;

    public NonSerializableClass nonSerializableClass;
}
 I tested. It works. (I tested by printing out all the value of member variables before and after serialization. They are same before and after) However, I do not understand why it works? As I do not provide proper readObject and writeObject, as required by Serializable interface. As pointed in Effective Java Item 75: Consider using a custom serialized form, do I need to provide my own readObject and writeObject, if I have custom member variables in my enum?

@TITLE:Putting detailed REST error message in HTTP Warning header, good/bad idea?
@CONTENT:We are developing a standard REST service using HTTP status codes as its response code if something went wrong. (e.g. invalid user input would return "400 Bad Request" to the client) However, we felt that a more detailed error message would be useful for the client. (e.g. the invalid input error is due to X being a unrecognized parameter name) We would like to be as faithful to the HTTP specs as possible, so after studying the specification in the RFC2616, we are thinking of putting the detailed error message in the HTTP Headers, specifically on the HTTP header warning field. It said on the RFC that: The Warning general-header field is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. This information is typically used to warn about a possible lack of semantic transparency from caching operations or transformations applied to the entity body of the message. There seems to be no restriction on using this header for other warnings (such as REST error message), even those that are unrelated with the cache warnings as per the original intention of this header. We like the semantic, and we planned to use the 299 warning code, which seems to fit the bill quite nicely: 299 Miscellaneous persistent warning The warning text MAY include arbitrary information to be presented to a human user, or logged. A system receiving this warning MUST NOT take any automated action. So, given the invalid input error case presented on the top of this question, we're thinking of putting our REST error message like the following example: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Warning: 299 ServiceName "Invalid input error: X is unrecognized parameter name."
 Is this a good idea/practice? We also found that some services detailed this message in X-Warning header, but this seems to be not standard. We are wondering what would the hive wisdom of stackoverflow REST crowd think about this. Is there also any better/standardized practice for passing out detailed error messaging in REST responses?

@TITLE:Can I programmatically apply Angular validation directives inside a custom directive?
@CONTENT:I have found great many occurrences of the following pattern for html inputs, this being for phone numbers: <input type="text" ng-model="CellPhoneNumber" required ng-pattern="/^[0-9]+$/" ng-minlength="10" />
 I would like to create a custom directive that, wherever applied, will tell Angular to apply all three of these rules, e.g: <input type="text" ng-model="CellPhoneNumber" bk-ng-validation="phoneNumber"/>
 Then, code in my directive would find and invoke a function called phoneNumber, in which I would like to see something like: Listing 1: function bkNgPhoneNumber(model) {
    // This is purely SPECULATIVE pseudo-code, just to convey an idea.
    model.errors.add(applyMinLength(10, model));
    model.errors.add(applyMaxLength(15, model));
    model.errors.add(applyPattern("/^[0-9]+$/", model));
}
 I would prefer the above approach over 'rewriting code for these rules, e.g: Listing 2: function phoneNumber(model) {
    if (model.length < 10 || model.length > 15) {
        model.errors.add("Must be 10 to 15 chars!");
    }
}
 I don't want to do away with all attribute based directives, but preferably create a 'macro' directive that will invoke my Listing 1 code, which will intern invoke a set of more 'micro' validations.
@CODE:<input type="text" ng-model="CellPhoneNumber" required ng-pattern="/^[0-9]+$/" ng-minlength="10" /> <input type="text" ng-model="CellPhoneNumber" bk-ng-validation="phoneNumber"/> phoneNumber function bkNgPhoneNumber(model) {
    // This is purely SPECULATIVE pseudo-code, just to convey an idea.
    model.errors.add(applyMinLength(10, model));
    model.errors.add(applyMaxLength(15, model));
    model.errors.add(applyPattern("/^[0-9]+$/", model));
} function phoneNumber(model) {
    if (model.length < 10 || model.length > 15) {
        model.errors.add("Must be 10 to 15 chars!");

Go to Eclipse->Export->Grandle so it add gradle file Open Android Studio and select Import Project and select my project folder with build.gradle file Press Finish and get an Error: failed to find target android-15 (this is was parget of my project) I go to system variables and change to %ANDROID_HOME% = d:\dev\android\android-studio\sdk\ (remove platform-tools from path) And get new error: failed to find Build Tools revision 15.0.0 Also create another New Project and change Android SDK for it, but I still cant import project I explore this problem and find the weak point: in file build.gradle I change next lines: from compileSdkVersion 15 to compileSdkVersion "17" from buildToolsVersion "15" to buildToolsVersion "17" And it fix my problem with project import. I think it's problem in Eclipse export function. Build tools starts only from version 17 (in ADT 22), so it's imposible to find version 15.

@TITLE:ExtJS 4.2: ToolTips not wide enough to see contents
@CONTENT:I've noticed since upgrading to ExtJS 4.2 that tooltips displayed when a textfield has an error in it are not wide enough to see the contents of the tooltip - they always seem to be 40px wide. Here's a test case which shows the problem: <html>
<head>
    <title>Field error tooltips</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ext-4.2.0/resources/css/ext-all.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="ext-4.2.0/ext-all-debug.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    Ext.onReady(function(){

        var form = Ext.create("Ext.form.Panel",{
            title: 'My form',
            width: 300,
            height: 100,
            items: [
                {xtype: 'textfield', name: 'FIELD1', fieldLabel: 'Field 1', allowBlank: false}
            ],
            renderTo: Ext.getBody()
        });
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
 In the above example if you click the field and then click out of it without typing anything, it shows a tooltip saying that it's not allowed to be blank. The tooltip is not wide enough to see the message unfortunately. Has anyone else come across this? Thanks!

@TITLE:Copy file permissions, but not files [closed]
@CONTENT:I have two copies of the same directory tree. They almost have the same files in both (one version may have a couple extra or missing files). However, most of the files are in common to both directories (have the same relative paths and everything). Assume these are in directories: version1/
version2/
 The problem is that the permissions in version1/ got messed up, and I would like to copy over the permissions from version2/, but do it without replacing the files in version1/ which are newer. Is there an automated way to do this via bash? (It doesn't have to be bash, it could be some other method/programming language as well).

@TITLE:Is there a better way to express nested namespaces in C++ within the header
@CONTENT:I switched from C++ to Java and C# and think the usage of namespaces/packages is much better there (well structured). Then I came back to C++ and tried to use namespaces the same way but the required syntax is horrible within the header file. namespace MyCompany
{
    namespace MyModule
    {
        namespace MyModulePart //e.g. Input
        {
            namespace MySubModulePart
            {
                namespace ...
                {
                    public class MyClass    
 The following seems strange to me too (to avoid the deep indent): namespace MyCompany
{
namespace MyModule
{
namespace MyModulePart //e.g. Input
{
namespace MySubModulePart
{
namespace ...
{
     public class MyClass
     {
 Is there a shorter Way to express the above thing? I am missing something like namespace MyCompany::MyModule::MyModulePart::...
{
   public class MyClass
 Update Ok, some say the concept of usage in Java/C# and C++ is different. Really? I think (dynamic) class loading is not the only purpose for namespaces (this is a very technical reasoned perspective). Why shouldn't I use it for a readability and structurization, e.g think of "IntelliSense". Currently, there is no logic / glue between a namespace and what you can find there. Java and C# does this much better... Why including <iostream> and having namespace std? Ok, if you say the logic should rely on the header to include, why does the #include does not uses an "IntelliSense" friendly syntax like #include <std::io::stream> or <std/io/stream>? I think the missing structurization in the default libs is one weakness of C++ compared to Java/C#. If uniqueness to avid conflicts is one Point (which is a point of C# and Java, too) a good idea is to use the project name or company name as namespace, don't you think so? On the one hand it's said C++ is the most flexible... but everyone said "don't do this"? It seems to me C++ can do many things but has a horrible syntax even for the easiest things in many cases compared to C#. Update 2 Most users say it is nonsense to create a deeper nesting than two Levels. Ok, so what about Windows::UI::Xaml and Windows::UI::Xaml::Controls::Primitives namespaces in Win8 development? I think Microsoft's usage of namespaces makes sense and it is indeed deeper than just 2 Levels. I think bigger libraries / projects need a deeper nesting (I hate class names like ExtraLongClassNameBecauseEveryThingIsInTheSameNameSpace... then you could put everything into the global namespace, too.) Update 3 - Conclusion Most say "don't do it", but... even boost has a deeper nesting then one or two levels. Yes, it is a library but: If you want reusable code - treat your own code like a library you would give someone else. I also use a deeper nesting for discovery purposes using namespaces.

{
    namespace MyModule

Edit: I've gotten a lot of speculative answers regarding why it's desirable for CHAR_BIT to be 8, and I agree, but what I'm really looking for is what the technical conflict between C99 and the networking stuff in POSIX is. My best guess is that it has something to do with C99 requiring uint*_t to be exact-sized types (no padding) whereas the inttypes.h previously in POSIX made no such requirement.

I have been able to focus on the button by doing button.seFocusableInTouchMode() and button.requestFocus(). But this highlights the button and is obviously not what I want.

@TITLE:JSLint - ignore sections of code
@CONTENT:I have a huge script that passes JSLint (including avoidance of all bad parts). Except for one stretch, which is some very convoluted obfuscated code that is embedded within the larger context. JSLint generates quite a bit of complaints for this section, and I'd like to selectively disable it for that stretch of code. I already do use selective   /*jlsint xxx:true/false*/
 directives to disable particular warnings for certain tiny stretches of code that do things contrary to the struct interpretation. The obfuscated code I have uses constructs that I don't know if they can be disabled. For instance: for(L=(117.>
 causes this message: Problem at line 1 character 57: A trailing decimal point can be confused with a dot '117.
 Sure, I know that I could clean up the code, but it is emitted from an obfuscator, and I really don't want to have to clean obfuscated code! So, is there a way to tell JSLint to completely ignore a stretch off code? I am aware of this query http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599859/jslint-control-comments-selective-ignore but it wasn't answered.

@CONTENT:Let's say I am about to implement 3 different features in 3 different files (fileA, fileB an fileC) for a new project of mine. I thought I'd just need to add my (currently empty) project to git: git init
 and then create 3 different branches: git branch file1_branch
git branch file2_branch
git branch file3_branch
 but this doesn't work: fatal: Not a valid object name: 'master'. Why is this? Maybe the problem could be related that even the master branch wasn't created at this point? I tried doing a git branch. It yielded nothing. I then thought about doing an "empty" commit to oblige git to create the master branch: git commit -m `initial_commit`
 but as I didn't add any files to the staging area it doesn't work. Keep in mind I'm just about to start my project, so at this point I don't have any files to add to the commit! How to solve this issue? Am I doing something wrong? Thanks

Should the model implement INotifyPropertyChanged? If so, what is difference between the VM and the model? If not, a change in the Model will not notify the VM and the View that it occured. So - considering the logic goes into the Model, it seems obvious that it should notify the ViewModel about some of it's changes. However, isn't it weird to implement INotifyPropertyChanged in both classes? Thank you very much!

But here is something I have done on a few sites, and that is use header('X-Powered-By: Alex');
 When I view the headers, I can see that it is now 'Alex' instead of the PHP version. My question is, will this send the previous PHP header first (before it reaches my header(), and is it detectable by any sniffer program? Or are headers 'collected' by PHP, before being sent back to the browser? By the way, this is not for security by obscurity, just curious how headers work in PHP.

@TITLE:Preferred method for viewing code generated by Template Haskell
@CONTENT:As you know, Template Haskell is used to generate various kinds of AST splices programmatically at compile-time. However, a splice can often be very opaque, and it is often difficult to discern what a splice actually generates. If you run the Q monad for a splice, and the splice is well-typed, you get a showable representation of the generated piece of AST, but this representation can be very difficult to understand, because of its unstructured layout. What is the preferred method for converting a piece of TH-generated AST into something akin to normal Haskell code, so that the code can be easily read and understood? Can one reconstruct source code from e.g. a given Dec value? Does one have to read the GHC Core code? Is there a way to at least structure the AST so that it becomes more readable (Beyond what e.g. the pretty-show package does)?

@TITLE:mocking functions using python mock
@CONTENT:I am trying to Mock a function (that returns some external content) using the python mock module (http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/index.html). I'm having some trouble mocking functions that are imported into a module. For example, in util.py I have def get_content():
  return "stuff"
 I want to mock util.get_content so that it returns something else. I am trying this: util.get_content=Mock(return_value="mocked stuff")
 If get_content gets invoked inside another module, it never actually seems to return the mocked object. Am I missing something in terms of how to use Mock? Note that if I invoke the following, things work correctly: >>> util.get_content=Mock(return_value="mocked stuff")
>>> util.get_content()
"mocked stuff"
 However, if get_content is called from inside another module, it invokes the original function instead of the mocked version: >>> from mymodule import MyObj
>>> util.get_content=Mock(return_value="mocked stuff")
>>> m=MyObj()
>>> m.func()
"stuff"
 Contents of mymodule.py from util import get_content

class MyObj:    
    def func():
        get_content()
 So I guess my question is - how do I get invoke the Mocked version of a function from inside a module that I call? It appears that the from module import function may be to blame here, in that it doesn't point to the Mocked function.
@CODE:def get_content():
  return "stuff" util.get_content=Mock(return_value="mocked stuff") get_content >>> util.get_content=Mock(return_value="mocked stuff")
>>> util.get_content()
"mocked stuff" >>> from mymodule import MyObj
>>> util.get_content=Mock(return_value="mocked stuff")
>>> m=MyObj()
>>> m.func()
"stuff" from util import get_content

        get_content() from module import function mymodule.func() mymodule.func() return util.get_content()

I did this by simply moving my local copy somewhere else (just in case) and typing "hg clone url". This part has worked just fine. However, when I try to pull the newly cloned local copy into Eclipse, I get the following error: /Users/Andrew/Dev/Workspace/Android/MyProject overlaps the location of another project: 'MyProject'
 My guess is that I have been committing some meta file or something that I shouldn't have. Does anyone have any ideas? Here is my .hgignore: syntax: regexp
\.DS_Store
.swo
.swp
.metadata/
/bin/
 Note: Looks like my hgignore is not blocking the gen folder. Could this be part of the problem?

A few of my students commented on this, and I'm wondering if I am teaching bad habits. My rationale is: Makes code more readable ¡X Easier to distinguish fields from local variables. Makes it easier to distinguish standard calls from static calls (especially in Java) Makes me remember that this call (unless the target is final) could end up on a different target, for example in an overriding version in a subclass. Obviously, this has zero impact on the compiled program, it's just readability. So am I making it more or less readable? Note: I turned it into a CW since there really isn't a correct answer.

Though I found this hint from your MSDN link. So if you edit your comment, I can make it the accepted answer... Thanks everybody! Please see my first comment on this question, it's not there... Somehow... I can select Target framework though (2.0, 3.0 and 3.5), not that I see any use of that for this particular problem... It doesn't have to be a 64bit program, actually, I rather prefer it to be 32bit anyway since it is more like a utility and it should work on 32bit systems. Also, I'm running Vista at 64bit. Maybe that has something to do with it? @Rob Cooper: Now I think of it, I never had the chance of selecting either a 64bit or a 32bit application when creating the solution/project/application... And according to your link "64-Bit Debugging (X64)" is possible with MS VB2008 express edition. Oh btw, I found the following: If you are debugging a 64-bit application and want to use Edit and Continue, you must change the target platform and compile the application as a 32-bit application. You can change this setting by opening the Project Properties and going to the Compile page. On that page, click Advanced Compile Options and change the Target CPU setting to x86 in the Advanced Compiler Settings dialog box. Link But I dont see the Target CPU setting...

However, when a new object of B is created, then - the default constructor of the class A is called prior to the default/custom constructor of class B is invoked. Maybe the purpose of this is that the fields of class A need to be initialized to default values. Now, suppose that class A has defined a custom constructor. This means that the default constructor of class A is silently removed by the compiler. Now, on creating a new instance of class B, which constructor of class A is automatically called before invoking the class B's constructor?

@TITLE:Set focus on first invalid input in AngularJs form
@CONTENT:I've read several articles and StackOverflow questions relating to the setting of focus in AngularJs. Unfortunately all the examples that I have read assume that there is some attribute that I can add to the element to gain focus, e.g. a focusMe directive. However what if I don't know in advance which input to set focus to? In particular how do I set focus to the first input element in a form that has $invalid set - i.e. an element that fails validation. There could be several inputs that fail validation, so I cannot use a directive that just tries to call .focus() based on this. (I am doing this for Accessibility/WCAG reasons, its good practice to do so on submit being clicked to minimize keypresses to find the first field that has failed validation). The $error object will give all controls that fail validation, but they are grouped by the type of failure not in any order of appearance on the form. I'm sure I can come up with some kludged way of doing this. A directive on the form, which receives some broadcast when focus needs to be set - that directive can then search for the first $invalid element. However this seems very complex and I'd like to know whether these is a better more 'angular' way of doing this.

@TITLE:Some of my unit tests tests are not finishing in XCode 4.4
@CONTENT:I have seen people posting about this here and elsewhere, but I haven't found any solution that works. I am using XCode 4.4 and have a bunch of unit tests set up. I have ran them all before on this project, so I know that they do pass/fail when they are supposed to if they are actually ran. I have about 15 test suites, and each one contains 1-7 tests. On most attempts, all of the test suites finished (and passed) except for 1 (FooTests). It gives the warning: FooTests did not finish
    testFoo did not finish
 XCode will report that testing was successful, regardless of what happens in unfinished tests. Another thing to note, sometimes it is a different test that will not finish, and sometimes multiple suites will not finish. I have not noticed a case where all tests do finish, but judging by this seemingly random behaviour I believe that it is possible. So, is this a bug in XCode? I can't think of any other reason that tests randomly don't finish and then cause XCode to report that everything was successful. Are there any solutions?
@CODE:FooTests did not finish
    testFoo did not finish

@TITLE:Find Active Tab using jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap
@CONTENT:I've been racking my brain for a little while now, and I would like to know if anyone out there knows how I can find the active tab, using jQuery and Twitter's Bootstrap. Pulling the hash from the URL is not my first option, I'm using the data-toggle attribute in the <a> link so there is no need to produce a URL hash. Any insight? Here's an example of my markup: <ul class="nav nav-list" id="sampleTabs">
    <li><a href="#example" data-toggle="tab">Tab 1</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane fade active in" id="example">
        Example Tab
    </div>
</div>

<script>
$('#sampleTabs a:first').tab('show');
</script>
 I'm open to any suggestion - using a PHP session, JS cookie, etc. Edit: This is the real issue. I have a pagination system using PHP, so when a page number or next/prev arrow is clicked, it will reload the page. This is why I need to find the active tab before loading the next page, since I"ll just pass it in the url or session, etc.
@CODE:data-toggle <a> <ul class="nav nav-list" id="sampleTabs">
    <li><a href="#example" data-toggle="tab">Tab 1</a></li>

@TITLE:Which FRP package to choose? [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm just starting to look into the world of Functional Reactive Programming in Haskell, and I would like to experiment with GUI programming (with gtk, because of substantial binding) in a reactional setting. Now, I've been looking a bit at Grapefruit, Reactive-Banana and Buster, and I would like any testament to the joy/horror of using any one or other package. All I have is these preliminary oppinions: I don't mind doing some of the binding of the FRP package to gtk myself, as I have an ambivalet feeling about the abstracted backend idea (that Grapefruit has).. While I find type theory interesting, I also value simple encodings for actual programs, which seems to put grapfruit-records a bit off.. That is, unless of course some of you persuades me to think otherwise :-)

@LINK:/questions/7080861/c-sharp-interface-method-ambiguity
@TITLE:C# interface method ambiguity
@CONTENT:Consider the following example: interface IBase1
{
   int Percentage { get; set; }
}

interface IBase2
{
   int Percentage { get; set; }
}

interface IAllYourBase : IBase1, IBase2
{
}

class AllYourBase : IAllYourBase
{
   int percentage;

   int Percentage {
      get { return percentage; }
      set { percentage = value; }
   }
}

void Foo()
{
   IAllYourBase iayb = new AllYourBase();
   int percentage = iayb.Percentage; // Fails to compile. Ambiguity between 'Percentage' property.
}
 In the example above, there is ambiguity between which Percentage property to call. Assuming the IBase1 and IBase2 interfaces may not be changed, how would I go about resolving this ambiguity in the cleanest, most preferred way? Update Based on the responses I was getting for using explicit interface implementation, I want to mention that while this does solve the problem it does not solve it in an ideal way for me because I use my AllYourBase object as an IAllYourBase most of the time, never as an IBase1 or IBase2. This is mostly because IAllYourBase also has interface methods (I failed to detail those in my code snippet above because I thought they were irrelevant) that are implemented by AllYourBase and I want to access those too. Casting back and forth all the time will get very tedious and result in messy code. I did try one solution that involved defining the Percentage property in IAllYourBase and not using explicit interface implementation, which seemed to get rid of the compiler error at least: class IAllYourBase : IBase1, IBase2
{
   int Percentage { get; set; }
}
 Is this a valid solution?
@CODE:interface IBase1
{
   int Percentage { get; set; }
}

interface IBase2
{
   int Percentage { get; set; }
}

interface IAllYourBase : IBase1, IBase2

class AllYourBase : IAllYourBase

   int percentage;

   int Percentage {

   IAllYourBase iayb = new AllYourBase();
   int percentage = iayb.Percentage; // Fails to compile. Ambiguity between 'Percentage' property.

@TITLE:Displaying vector graphics in a browser
@CONTENT:I need to display some interactive (attaching with DOM listeners etc. and event handling) vector graphics in web site I am working on. There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - excanvas, GFX of Dojo Toolkit and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup. So the question actually consists of several parts: Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events? If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in. [EDIT] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter: The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc. The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities. Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7. Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes. I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library Degrafa. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them. [EDIT 2] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by "Windows lock-in" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one is able to launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user. @Akira: Have you had any problems with those "SVG renderers" on IE7? I get thrown Javascript errors all the time.

@TITLE:Windows Help files - what are the options?
@CONTENT:Back in the old days, Help was not trivial but possible: generate some funky .rtf file with special tags, run it through a compiler, and you got a WinHelp file (.hlp) that actually works really well. Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista. Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice "Navigation to the webpage was canceled" screen that is caused by security restrictions. While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings. Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)? PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor? HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff). Edit: I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the "No Setup, Just Extract and Run" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem. So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make. CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.

@CONTENT:The following program prints the same number twice on gcc 4.8.2: #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char a[13];
    printf("sizeof a  is %zu\n", sizeof a );
    printf("sizeof(a) is %zu\n", sizeof(a));
}
 According to this reddit post, gcc is not standard-conformant in this respect, because a parenthesized expression is not on the list of exceptions for when array-to-pointer decay does not happen. Is this guy correct? Here is the relevant standard quote: Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator or the unary & operator, or is a character string literal used to initialize an array of character type, or is a wide string literal used to initialize an array with element type compatible with wchar_t, an lvalue that has type 'array of type' is converted to an expression that has type 'pointer to type' that points to the initial member of the array object and is not an lvalue. Just to be clear, he argues that (a) should trigger array-to-pointer decay, because parentheses are not covered in the list above (sizeof operator, unary & operator, string literal as initializer).
@CODE:#include <stdio.h>

int main()

 I used to run the same application in Java 1.7. My colleagues upgraded to 1.8 and no longer able to run it. I tested with SUN JDK and now I am on OpenJDK again and that does not help Current JDK openjdk version "1.8.0_40" JAVA_HOME, JAVA_PATH and any other variable seems to point to the correct JDK installation. I have removed all the previous (JDK 1.6 & 1.7 from the OS to be sure that there is no reference to them). For some reason GGTS still complains for a wrong JVM. I understand the error might be related to a compiler 1.7 trying to compile files in the 1.8, but I am not sure where this reference is comming from in eclipse.

@CONTENT:MSDN says: swap should be used in preference to iter_swap, which was included in the C++ Standard for backward compatibility. But comp.std.c++ says: Most STL algorithms operate on iterator ranges. It therefore makes sense to use iter_swap when swapping elements within those ranges, since that is its intended purpose --- swapping the elements pointed to by two iterators. This allows optimizations for node-based sequences such as std::list, whereby the nodes are just relinked, rather than the data actually being swapped. So which one is correct? Should I use iter_swap, or should I use swap? (Is iter_swap only for backwards compatibility?) Why?

@TITLE:Poorly-balanced socket accepts with Linux 3.2 kernel vs 2.6 kernel
@CONTENT:I am running a fairly large-scale Node.js 0.8.8 app using Cluster with 16 worker processes on a 16-processor box with hyperthreading (so 32 logical cores). We are finding that since moving to the Linux 3.2.0 kernel (from 2.6.32), the balancing of incoming requests between worker child processes seems be heavily weighted to 5 or so processes, with the other 11 not doing much work at all. This may be more efficient for throughput, but seems to increase request latency and is not optimal for us because many of these are long-lived websocket connections that can start doing work at the same time. The child processes are all accepting on a socket (using epoll), and while this problem has a fix in Node 0.9 (https://github.com/bnoordhuis/libuv/commit/be2a2176ce25d6a4190b10acd1de9fd53f7a6275), that fix does not seem to help in our tests. Is anyone aware of kernel tuning parameters or build options that could help, or are we best-off moving back to the 2.6 kernel or load balancing across worker processes using a different approach? We boiled it down to a simple HTTP Siege test, though note that this is running with 12 procs on a 12-core box with hyperthreading (so 24 logical cores), and with 12 worker processes accepting on the socket, as opposed to our 16 procs in production.

@TITLE:Can a thunk be duplicated to improve memory performance?
@CONTENT:One of my struggles with lazy evaluation in Haskell is the difficulty of reasoning about memory usage. I think the ability to duplicate a thunk would make this much easier for me. Here's an example. Let's create a really big list: let xs = [1..10000000]
 Now, let's create a bad function: bad = do
    print $ foldl1' (+) xs
    print $ length xs
 With no optimizations, this eats up a few dozen MB of ram. The garbage collector can't deallocate xs during the fold because it will be needed for calculating the length later. Is it possible to reimplement this function something like this: good = do
    (xs1,xs2) <- copyThunk xs
    print $ foldl1' (+) xs1
    print $ length xs2
 Now, xs1 and xs2 would represent the same value, but also be independent of each other in memory so the garbage collector can deallocate during the fold preventing memory wasting. (I think this would slightly increase the computational cost though?) Obviously in this trivial example, refactoring the code could easily solve this problem, but It seems like it's not always obvious how to refactor. Or sometimes refactoring would greatly reduce code clarity.
@CODE:let xs = [1..10000000] bad = do
    print $ foldl1' (+) xs
    print $ length xs good = do
    (xs1,xs2) <- copyThunk xs
    print $ foldl1' (+) xs1
    print $ length xs2 let xs :: (Num a, Enum a) => [a]; xs = [1 .. 10000000] xs () = [1 .. 10000000] xs

@CONTENT:This question is related to "How the yin-yang puzzle works?". The yin yang example of continuations in scheme looks like this, according to Wikipedia article: (let* ((yin
     ((lambda (cc) (display #\@) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c))))
   (yang
     ((lambda (cc) (display #\*) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c)))))
(yin yang))
 I am trying to write an equivalent piece of code in a (edit: statically) typed language, such as SML/NJ, but it is giving me typing errors. So either the puzzle does not type, or I am misunderstanding the scheme syntax. What would the above piece of code look like in SML or Ocaml (with callcc extension)? By the way, what is the source of the puzzle? Where did it come from? Edit: I think I know the answer. We need a recursive type t satisfying t = t -> s for some type s. Edit of edit: No it is not, the answer is a recursive type t satisfying t = t -> t.
@CODE:(let* ((yin
     ((lambda (cc) (display #\@) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c))))
   (yang
     ((lambda (cc) (display #\*) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c)))))
(yin yang)) callcc t t = t -> s s t t = t -> t

@TITLE:Store run configuration with project in Eclipse
@CONTENT:I'm programming in NetBeans however i like to get used to Eclipse as well. I have a Maven project what i've developed in NetBeans and after importing it compiles fine in Eclipse. I'm using the Run or Debug feature of NetBeans a lot, and it's very comfortable that the run configuration gets stored with the project so i can actually commit it into version control and others can use it as well. Say i have a Java application project which has a main class. To run this, i need to define the correct class path for the exec goal (actually NetBeans automatically does this for me when creating the new project). In Eclipse i have to define Run configurations which as far as i know gets stored in the workspace but not in the project. Is there any similar feature in Eclipse what i'm looking for?

@TITLE:Oracle SQL Developer and PostgreSQL
@CONTENT:I'm trying to connect to a PostgreSQL 9.1 database using Oracle SQL Developer 3.0.04, but I'm not having any success so far. First, if I add a third party driver on preferences, when adding a new connection there's no tab for PostgreSQL (it works fine for MySQL though). I'm using a JDBC4 version 9.1 driver, but I tried a JDBC3 of the same version and still get the same thing. Second, there's nothing like manual configuration tab when adding a new connection. The closest is the Advanced option on Oracle tab, where I can provide a custom URL, but it fails because complains about the selected Driver (of course). Finally, I got connected importing a connection from an XML file (contents below), but it displays only my schemas and doesn't show my tables inside them. So, my question is: does Orable SQL Developer support PostgreSQL connections? Is there any other way to have my tables being displayed in the ObjectViewer? <?xml version = '1.0' encoding = 'UTF-8'?>

@CONTENT:I need to convert a string, obtained from excel, in VBA to an interger. To do so I'm using CInt() which works well. However there is a chance that the string could be something other than a number, in this case I need to set the integer to 0. Currently I have: If oXLSheet2.Cells(4, 6).Value <> "example string" Then
  currentLoad = CInt(oXLSheet2.Cells(4, 6).Value)
Else
  currentLoad = 0
End If
 The problem is that I cannot predict all possible non numeric strings which could be in this cell. Is there a way I can tell it to convert if it's an integer and set to 0 if not? Cheers Cap

I only can think of calling this command N times given that I can have all the N test assembly in my solution (!?) Moreover, the results after run are per-assembly basics so that it's not easy to get what tests were failed/passed. If you know a better way, please share! Thank you!

@TITLE:When 1 px border is added to div, Div size increases, Dont want to do that
@CONTENT:On click I am adding, 1px border to div, so Div size increases by 2px X 2px. I dont want to get div size increased. Is there any simple way to do so? Messy Detailed Explanation Actually I am adding DIVs with float:left (same size, like icons) to a container-div, so all stacks up one after another, and when (container-div width is 300px) no space left width-wise so child DIVs comes in next row, so its like catalog, but because of border only selected DIV size get increased, DIV under selected DIV goes to right and creates empty space below selected DIV. Cheers, EDIT: Decreasing Height/Width on selection, but how to increase it back. Using some 3rd party framework, so don't have event when DIV loses selection..

@CONTENT:I'd been reading up on themes in my ASP.NET book and thought that it could be a very handy solution, then I met some problems. The theme picks up every single CSS file in the folder If you want to use reset styles (where ordering is important) the order of imported stylesheets is not guaranteed Your master page would not explicitly indicate what style is being used, only the rendered page can tell you that unless you dig into your web.config Styling web controls using the theme file is... well... stupid? You can simply do this in your stylesheet. Granular control should be at the HTML level, should it not? How do you specify print stylesheets without having all styles in a single stylesheet? I'm wondering as to whether they're actually worth using at all. Is there any benefit? Are there any major sites using them? EDIT Just to clarify slolife's last point. If I had two stylesheets, one called print.css and one called main.css and I used ASP.NET themes, how would it know that print.css was a print stylesheet? In regular HTML you use the media type in the tag itself (i.e. <link rel= ...>) but the themes wouldn't know this, so it would just get included as a regular stylesheet.

@TITLE:How to unwind the stack to get backtrace for the specified stack pointer (SP)?
@CONTENT:I'm writing this for Android (ARM only), but I believe the principle is the same for generic Linux as well. I'm trying to capture the stack trace from within the signal handler, so that I can log it when my app crashes. This is what I've come up with using <unwind.h>. Initialization: struct sigaction signalhandlerDescriptor;
memset(&signalhandlerDescriptor, 0, sizeof(signalhandlerDescriptor));
signalhandlerDescriptor.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO;
signalhandlerDescriptor._u._sa_sigaction = signalHandler;
sigaction(SIGSEGV, &signalhandlerDescriptor, 0);

    state->pc = (void*)_Unwind_GetIP(context);
    if (state->pc)
    {
        if (state->current == state->end)
            return _URC_END_OF_STACK;
        else
            *state->current++ = reinterpret_cast<void*>(state->pc);
    }
    return _URC_NO_REASON;
}

inline size_t captureBacktrace(void** addrs, size_t max, unsigned long pc)

    BacktraceState state = {addrs, addrs + max, (void*)pc};
    _Unwind_Backtrace(unwindCallback, &state);

    return state.current - addrs;
}

inline void dumpBacktrace(std::ostream& os, void** addrs, size_t count)
{
    for (size_t idx = 0; idx < count; ++idx) {
        const void* addr = addrs[idx];
        const char* symbol = "";

        Dl_info info;
        if (dladdr(addr, &info) && info.dli_sname) {
            symbol = info.dli_sname;
        }

        int status = -3;
        char * demangledName = abi::__cxa_demangle(symbol, 0, 0, &status);
        os << "#" << idx << ": " << addr << "  " << (status == 0 ? demangledName : symbol) << "\n";
        free(demangledName);
    }
}

void signalHandler(int sig, siginfo_t *siginfo, void *uctx)

    ucontext * context = (ucontext*)uctx;
    unsigned long PC = context->uc_mcontext.arm_pc;
    unsigned long SP = context->uc_mcontext.arm_sp;

    Logger() << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << "Fatal signal:" << sig;
    const size_t maxNumAddresses = 50;
    void* addresses[maxNumAddresses];

    const size_t actualNumAddresses = captureBacktrace(addresses, maxNumAddresses, PC);
    dumpBacktrace(oss, addresses, actualNumAddresses);
    Logger() << oss.str();
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
 Problem: if I get the PC register by calling _Unwind_GetIP(context) in unwindCallback, I get the complete trace for the signal handler stack. Which is a separate stack, and that's obviously not what I want. So I tried supplying the PC taken from the ucontext in signal handler, and got a weird result: I get one stack entry, it is the correct entry - the function which caused the signal in the first place. But it's logged twice (even the address is the same, so it's not a symbolic name look up bug). Obviously, that's not good enough - I need the whole stack. And I wonder if this result is merely accidental (i. e. it shouldn't work in general. Now, I read I need to also supply the stack pointer, which I apparently can get from ucontext, same as PC. But I don't know what to do with it. Do I have to unwind manually instead of using _Unwind_Backtrace? If so, can you give me sample code? I've been searching for the better part of a day, and still couldn't find anything I could copy and paste into my project. For what it's worth, here's the libunwind source which contains _Unwind_Backtrace definition. Thought I could figure something out if I see its source, but it's way more complicated than I expected.

@TITLE:PHP/Imagick: How to crate a large ( High Quality 300dpi ) image from JSON / array of Data ( width,height,x,y,angels) using PHP ImageMagic / Imagick
@CONTENT:i created a design (270x470) with some pictures and text on Canvas using FabricJs then i export all pictures/text information in JSON format by fabricJS's canvas.toJSON() method And Now i need to Re-Draw that design on a High Quality (2790x4560) image in PHP using Imagick. JSON dataArray for above design which contains all object's information like size,position,angle etc.. {

}
 My Output results (90%) is there with above solution, but as we can see some image (blue number line) doesn't place at exact position which should look like first design image Basically what i am trying to do is, " Inside a Loop calling an addImage Method for scale - rotate - position each image on Print Image(300DPi) i am not sure what i am missing to get exact offset (new x,y coordinates/position/Left-Top ) after Rotation for an image in Imagick or i am Rotating object after Scale then compose or May be A Math Formula like Math.PI :) Question is: How Can i Calculate New offset/Position according to Rotation Degree/Angle after Scale ? I hope posted snippet are useful for everyone.

@LINK:/questions/22258054/c-inconsistency-between-gcc-and-clang
@TITLE:C++ inconsistency between gcc and clang
@CONTENT:I came across a C++ inconsistency between gcc (versions 4.8.1, 4.8.2) and clang (versions 3.3, 3.4). I wonder which one is correct. Here's the program: template < typename T > struct Result {};
template < typename T > struct Empty {};

template < typename T >
struct Bad_Type_Fcn {
    typedef typename Empty< T >::type type;
};

template < typename T >
Result< T >
f( const T& ) {
    return Result< T >();
}

template< class U >
Result< typename Bad_Type_Fcn< U >::type >
f( const U&, int ) {
    return Result< typename Bad_Type_Fcn< U >::type >();
}

int main() {
    (void)f< int >(42);
}
 Clearly, this code is not meant to do anything; it is an aggressive simplification of something that appears in the Boost Range library (with f simplifying make_iterator_range). The Bad_Type_Fcn is a type function (technically, a struct) which should never be instantiated, because Empty<T>::type never exists, for any T. The presence of this struct and of the second template specialization of f() is not an error in itself. IRL, f() provides some functionality for certain types for which Bad_Type_Fcn is not empty. However that is not the concern here, which is why I simplified those out. I still want f() to work for types where Bad_Type_Fcn is empty. I'm compiling with {g++|clang++} [-std=c++0x] -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -c. The language standard selection doesn't seem to make a difference. With clang, the program compiles without errors or warnings. With gcc, I get an error: weird.cpp: In instantiation of ¡¥struct Bad_Type_Fcn<int>¡¦:
weird.cpp:17:5:   required by substitution of ¡¥template<class U> Result<typename Bad_Type_Fcn<T>::type> f(const U&, int) [with U = int]¡¦

weird.cpp:6:43: error: no type named ¡¥type¡¦ in ¡¥struct Empty<int>¡¦
         typedef typename Empty< T >::type type;
 What seems to be happening is that clang eliminates the second overload of f(), probably(?) on the basis that the call is made with 1 argument only, integer 42, while the second overload requires 2 arguments. On the other hand, gcc doesn't eliminate the second overload, and instead tries to instantiate struct Bad_Type_Fcn<int>, which results in an error. The inconsistency disappears if I remove the explicit instantiation in the call to f(), and write (void)f(42); instead. Which of the compilers is correct?
@CODE:gcc 4.8.1 4.8.2 clang 3.3 3.4 template < typename T > struct Result {};

 I have a 2 questions/problems: the docs recommend creating a controller in another way (due to minification issues) for example: myApp.controller('GreetingCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) { $scope.greeting = 'Hola!'; }]); But if I create the controller like this, how could I Inject it into the modalInstance? The controller I call here isn't a Modal Instance controller but my global loginCtrl, is this a problem? should I subclass somehow the loginCtrl or call it from the ModalInstanceCtrl? and if so - how exactly? I'll be glad for guidance and clarfication about this. Thanks!

@TITLE:if(false==condition). Why? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: What is the difference between these (bCondition == NULL) and (NULL==bCondition)? 6 answers I have received code from someone working earlier on it, and it contains a lot of lines like while(false==find && false == err && k<kmax)
if(true==refract(ep1,ep2,n1,RI_blood, RI_collagen))
 and my favorite line is if(false == (ret_s<0))
 The other code is done really well, documented just fine, but these lines with these odd conditions are throwing me off, and I wonder why they are done that way. Especially that false==(ret_s<0) is completely confusing, and you kind of need to read that line like three times to understand what they want there. Is this a common programming style, don't I understand the reasoning for that, or is that just bad style? Edit: I don't feel this is similar to if(object==NULL) vs if(NULL==object), since this isn't about accidental assigning but about obfuscated if clauses...

@TITLE:Invalid use of BasicClientConnManager: connection still allocated
@CONTENT:I am making a call to REST URL and trying to measure how much time it is taking to get the response back. I am using DefaultHttpClient for that to get the response back from REST URL. In my below program , each thread will be working on a particular range. Like Each Thread will work between 1 - 100 and second thread will work between 101 - 200 etc. SO in my below code, for the first time it works fine. But for the second time, it is throwing exception on this line httpclient.execute for the second time as- java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid use of BasicClientConnManager: connection still allocated.
Make sure to release the connection before allocating another one.
 Is there anything wrong I am doing here?- Below is my code- class Task implements Runnable {

    private DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    private HttpGet httpGet;
    private HttpResponse response;

    @Override
    public void run() {

        try {

    private HttpGet httpGet;
    private HttpResponse response;

    @Override
    public void run() {

        try {

                httpGet = new HttpGet("http://localhost:8080/service/BEService/v1/get/USERID=10000/profile.ACCOUNT.SERVICE");
                httpGet.getRequestLine();

                long start = System.nanoTime();

 Why shouldn't the x+"foo" above return the same value as the final value of x in the above transcript? This question follows on from NPE's question here: Is the behaviour of Python's list += iterable documented anywhere? Update: I know it is not required that heterogenous += work (but it does) and likewise, it is not required that heterogenous + be an error. This question is about why that latter choice was made. It is too much to say that the results of adding a sequence to a list are uncertain. If that were a sufficient objection, it would make sense to prevent heterogenous +=. Update2: In particular, python always delegates operator calls to the lefthand operand, so no issue "what is the right thing to do" arises": the left-hand object always governs (unless it delegates to the right). Update3: For anyone arguing that this is a design decision, please explain (a) why it is not documented; or (b) where it is documented. Update4: "what should [1] + (2, ) return?" It should return a result value equal with the value of a variable x initially holding [1] immediately after x+=(2, ). This result is well-defined.

@TITLE:Where to find the twitter bootstrap less files?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to find a relatively easy way of adding padding to my containers with Twitter Bootstrap. All works well but at some resolutions, the window doesn't fit the screen. I figure I have to go and compensate for the padding by removing some of the width from various span classes? This is quite hard work, just the mathematics alone is problematic. For this reason, perhaps it's best to use the less file that Bootstrap apparently comes with. The only problem is I can't seem to find them anywhere. Do these files actually exist? Unfortunately I only know how to use Less through an app like Codekit as opposed to using the command line. Alternatively, if anyone else knows of any way to add padding to the container, it would be much appreciated. Thank you.

@TITLE:What's the current status of restricted monads?
@CONTENT:Going back to at least the late 1990s there have been people wishing for the integration of restricted monads into Haskell in a friendly way. For example, without restricted monads you can't make an efficient monad out of Set, Map or probability distributions. Here's a SO question from a few years ago where someone else ran afoul of this problem. There are various workarounds that people have come up with, including: Creating a new type class for every possible restriction. Using Template Haskell. Using Constraint Kinds. None of these approaches seem to be "canonical" however. I found a comment from Don Stewart on this blog post, in 2007, where he intimated that we were "quite close" to having restricted monads with Indexed types. What is the current status? Is there now a 'canonical' way to do restricted monads? Or we are still living with workarounds?

@LINK:/questions/11009022/select-top-1-1-vs-if-existsselect-1
@TITLE:¡§SELECT TOP 1 1¡¨ VS ¡§IF EXISTS(SELECT 1¡¨
@CONTENT:I have some .NET code that checks for the existence of a SQL record at a moderately-high interval. I am looking to make this check as "cheap" as possible. I'm wondering the characteristics of two queries: IF EXISTS(SELECT 1
          FROM   BigTable
          WHERE  SomeColumn = 200)
  SELECT 1 AS FOUND
ELSE
  SELECT 0 AS FOUND
 VS SELECT TOP 1 1
FROM   BigTable
WHERE  SomeColumn = 200 
 They both produce similar execution plans. But the SELECT TOP 1 1 seems to execute faster: Less query to parse and when record is not found, it sends less down the pipe. I'm also assuming it runs faster at the client because I just need to check the Record Count, rather than marshaling the return value of IF EXISTS. Most of the performance benefits are negligible. But if both consistently return the same result, then why not choose the slightly faster method? Is "SELECT TOP 1 1" THEE best way to check for an existence of a record in .NET? (We use .NET 3.5, and I am trying to avoid LINQ because it is not used elsewhere in the application. We also have some legacy VB6 apps that we are migrating/rewriting, so they may need to execute this as well.) EDIT: Just a little more detail on design. This record is a "header". There is another table that has child records that will be read/parsed when this header is found. The lack of a record is a good thing: there is no work to do. EDIT2: The lack of a record that meets the condition will occur more often. They come in sporadic waves.

With Java/Maven, I would use jcl-over-slf4j and logback-classic so that I can use logback as the unified logging backend. I would also eliminate the commons-logging dependency that the third-party lib would let sbt pull in.

 However, since the closest I've come is something I'm not 100% satisfied with the semantics of; <div class="redundant-wrapper">
    <dl class="main-list">

 I was wondering if anyone has any other ideas of how you might do this? Also, the reason the items would be grouped is because they are visually grouped in the content that is being marked up. Imagine a dictionary page, with a single definition list, where each definition is in an inset box that is floated left. I run into this situation all the time.

public class ImageFileGenerator : IImageFileGenerator

    void RenameFiles(IList<IImageLink> links, string sourceFolder);
    void CopyFiles(IList<IImageLink> links, string sourceFolder, stringDestFolder);
}

public class ImageFileGenerator : IImageFileGenerator
{
    private readonly int _folderPrefixLength;

    public ImageFileGenerator()
    {
        _folderPrefixLength = 4;
    }

    public void RenameFiles(IList<IImageLink> links, string sourceFolder)
    {
        // Do stuff
    }

    public void CopyFiles(IList<IImageLink> links, string sourceFolder, stringDestFolder)
    {
        // Do stuff
    }
}
 I don't like that I'm passing in the exact same thing in both cases (except the destination folder). In the current implementation of the IImageFileGenerator, I need to execute both methods and the same values were needed for each method. That is why I passed the state in via the constructor. 2. public interface IImageFileGenerator
{
    void RenameFiles();
    void CopyFiles();
}

public class ImageLinkContext
{
    // various properties to hold the values needed in the
    // ImageFileGenerator implementation.
}

public class ImageFileGenerator : IImageFileGenerator
{
    private readonly IList<IImageLink> _links;
    private readonly string _sourceFolder;
    private readonly string _destinationFolder;
    private readonly int _folderPrefixLength;

    public ImageFileGenerator(ImageLinkContext imageLinkContext)
    {
        // could also use these values directly in the methods 
        // by adding a single ImageLinkContext field and skip 
        // creating the other fields
        _links = imageLinkContext.ImageLinks;
        _sourceFolder = imageLinkContext.Source;
        _destinationFolder = imageLinkContext.Destination;
        _folderPrefixLength = 4;
    }

    public void RenameFiles()
    {
        // Do stuff, uses all the class fields except destination folder
    }

    public void CopyFiles()
    {
        // Do stuff, uses all the class fields
    }
}
 This approach may even be tweaked to a Facade Service (previously called aggregate services) as mentioned by Mark Seemann here. I've also read that you could use properties for those values and use property injection, though it seems like that is not preferred anymore (autofac mentions constructor injection is preferred... Ninject I believe even removed the ability in version 2). Alternatively I've read that you can also create an initialize method and ensure that the properties are set in there. So many options and I'm getting more confused as I read more about this stuff. I'm sure there is no definitive correct way (or maybe there is, at least for this example???), but maybe someone can provide pros and cons of each approach. Or maybe there is another approach that I've totally missed. I realize now that this question is probably a little on the subjective side (and is really more than one question), but I'm hoping you can forgive me and provide some guidance. PS - I'm currently trying my hand with autofac in case that influences which design may fit better. NOTE: I've made a slight change to the code about the destination folder... it is not used by RenameFiles (may have a bearing on your answer).

@TITLE:IOS - External (hdmi) output fills only half the screen except when coding view manually
@CONTENT:So, as the title says, I have an hdmi out on the iPad and an observer registered for screen connections, upon connection the user chooses the res and a view is outputted. However, if I load a view from a nib, or even from a programatic view controller, the ipad shows a landscape view in portrait (yes, both situations are set to landscape). I.e. ExternalViewController *ex = [[ExternalViewController alloc] init];
[externalWindow setRootViewController:ex];
 does this: If I create the view itself programatically. like so: UIView *test = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:[externalScreen applicationFrame]];
[test setBackgroundColor:[UIColor whiteColor]];
UILabel *msgLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 40, 100, 30)];
msgLabel.text = @"External!";
[test addSubview:msgLabel];
 It runs like some form of magical dream: However I want the viewcontroller to load (and work!) so, StackOverflow, I ask you. has anyone come across this before? EDIT: It does go without saying that common sensical answers do not get a bounty, I am after a fix, not a workaround. With my limited brain, all I can think to do is create a method that creates a view based on it's inputs and adds that as a subview of the external monitor, it is clear that this is a hack solution so a fix is appreciated! Thanks! EDIT: -(id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)_rect 
{
    rect = _rect;
    if (self = [super init]) 
    {
        externalView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"105.png"]];
        externalView.alpha = 0.0;
        [externalView setFrame:rect];
        [externalView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor yellowColor]];
        self.view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:rect];
        self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

        return self;

@TITLE:Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'toLowerCase' of undefined
@CONTENT:I ran into a very vague error while doing some simple jQuery DOM manipulation. The line that triggered the error is the following: $(this).closest('tr').remove(); The error, as stated in the title, is: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'toLowerCase' of undefined in file: jquery-1.6.2.js. I have already tried with jQuery 1.6.3 and jQuery 1.5.1, but nothing changed. I still keep getting the error. The line above is bound to a button which, when clicked, submits an AJAX POST request, then when successful, it removes its own <tr>. I have already tried another way by doing: $(this).parent().parent().remove() but to my surprise, this did nothing. I'm using Chrome, in case it matters, but I get the same error in FF. EDIT: This is my code: $(".remove").live('click', function(e)  {
    var str = $(this).attr('id').match(/\[(.*?)\]\[(.*?)\]/);
    var type = str[1];
    var id = str[2];

            // IF I PUT THE remove() HERE, IT WORKS.

    $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: '/admin/ajax_remove_event_detail',
        data: {type: type, id: id},
        success:function(res)   {
            if(res)
            {
                $(this).closest('tr').remove();
                // this gives me an error
            }

            {
              // error handling 
            }
        }
    });

    e.preventDefault();
});
 If I put the remove() outside of the if somewhere, it works. Why won't it work when it's inside the ajax call/if? Makes no sense to me? :( Any help here? Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:I've been trying to figure out how the fork-exec mechanism is used inside Linux. Everything was going on according to the plan until some web pages started to confuse me. It is said that a child process should strictly use _exit() instead of a simple exit() or a normal return from main(). As I know, Linux shell fork-execs every one of the external commands; assuming what I said above is true, the conclusion is that none of these external commands nor any other execution happening inside the Linux shell can do normal return! Wikipedia & some other webpages claim we've got to use _exit() just to prevent a child process causing deletion of parent's temporary files while a probable double flushing of stdio buffers may happen. though I understand the former, I have no clues how a double flushing of buffers could be harmful to a Linux system. I've spent my whole day on this... Thanks for any clarification.

 I looked at some references on the android developers site: More Resource Types : Color and found this code: Example:XML file saved at res/values/colors.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
   <color name="opaque_red">#f00</color>
   <color name="translucent_red">#80ff0000</color>
</resources>
 This application code retrieves the color resource: Resources res = getResources();
int color = res.getColor(R.color.opaque_red);
 This layout XML applies the color to an attribute: <TextView
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:textColor="@color/translucent_red"
    android:text="Hello"/>
 I think my two xml files follow this example pretty close - however the only difference is that I haven't used any application code to retrieve the color resource. I don't believe this is necessary (but it is a difference.) I thought I'd see if anyone else had similar problems or a solution? or is this a bug? I did update all my android sdk (and Eclipse plugin) files last week so I believe them to be the latest and greatest. -J

 This would make sense if the size of long on my system was 32 bits. However, sizeof(long) returns 8 and CHAR_BIT is defined as 8 suggesting that long should be 8x8 = 64 bits long. What am I missing here? Are sizeof and CHAR_BIT inaccurate or have I misunderstood something fundamental?

@TITLE:Why has Python decided against constant references?
@CONTENT:Note: I'm not talking about preventing the rebinding of a variable. I'm talking about preventing the modification of the memory that the variable refers to, and of any memory that can be reached from there by following the nested containers. I have a large data structure, and I want to expose it to other modules, on a read-only basis. The only way to do that in Python is to deep-copy the particular pieces I'd like to expose - prohibitively expensive in my case. I am sure this is a very common problem, and it seems like a constant reference would be the perfect solution. But I must be missing something. Perhaps constant references are hard to implement in Python. Perhaps they don't quite do what I think they do. Any insights would be appreciated. While the answers are helpful, I haven't seen a single reason why const would be either hard to implement or unworkable in Python. I guess "un-Pythonic" would also count as a valid reason, but is it really? Python does do scrambling of private instance variables (starting with __) to avoid accidental bugs, and const doesn't seem to be that different in spirit. EDIT: I just offered a very modest bounty. I am looking for a bit more detail about why Python ended up without const. I suspect the reason is that it's really hard to implement to work perfectly; I would like to understand why it's so hard.

@CONTENT:I would like to draw a standard 2D line graph with pylot, but force the axes' values to be between 0 and 600 on the x, and 10k and 20k on the y. Let me go with an example... import pylab as p

p.axis([0.0,600.0,1000000.0,2000000.0])

#define keys and items elsewhere..
p.plot(keys,items)
p.savefig(save_file, dpi=100)
 However, the axes still adjust to the size of the data. I'm interpreting the effect of p.axis to be setting what the max and min could be, not enforcing them to be the max or min. The same happens when I try to use p.xlim() etc. Any thoughts? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/21038375/what-is-the-purpose-of-xctestcases-setup-method
@TITLE:What is the purpose of XCTestCase's setUp method?
@CONTENT:Per the comment within the default template for XCTestCase regarding setUp : Put setup code here; it will be run once, before the first test case. However, in XCTestCase.h, the comment above setUp states differently: Setup method called before the invocation of each test method in the class. To confirm the actual behavior, I put an NSLog withinsetUp to count how many times it was called: static int count = 0;

- (void)setUp
{
    [super setUp];
    count++;

    NSLog(@"Call Count = %d", count);
}
 This resulted in the setUp method being called before every test method (confirming the comment on XCTestCase.h). I wanted to use the setUp method to create test/mock objects once (e.g. to setup a Core Data test stack). Creating these over and over again would be processor intensive and potentially very slow. So, 1) What is setUp actually intended to be used for? Surely developers aren't creating objects in it over and over? 2) How can I create these objects only once within an XCTestCase?
@CODE:XCTestCase setUp Put setup code here; it will be run once, before the first test case. XCTestCase.h setUp Setup method called before the invocation of each test method in the class. NSLog setUp static int count = 0;

@LINK:/questions/20762952/most-efficient-standard-compliant-way-of-reinterpreting-int-as-float
@TITLE:Most efficient standard-compliant way of reinterpreting int as float
@CONTENT:Assume I have guarantees that float is IEEE 754 binary32. Given a bit pattern that corresponds to a valid float, stored in std::uint32_t, how does one reinterpret it as a float in a most efficient standard compliant way? float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
   return /* apply sorcery to ui */;
}
 I've got a few ways that I know/suspect/assume have some issues: Via reinterpret_cast, float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    return reinterpret_cast<float&>(ui);
}
 or equvalently float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    return *reinterpret_cast<float*>(&ui);
}
 which suffers from aliasing issues. Via union, float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    union {
        std::uint32_t ui;
        float f;
    } u = {ui};
    return u.f;
}
 which is not actually legal, as it is only allowed to read from most recently written to member. Yet, it seems some compilers (gcc) allow this. Via std::memcpy, float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    float f;
    std::memcpy(&f, &ui, 4);
    return f;
}
 which AFAIK is legal, but a function call to copy single word seems wasteful, though it might get optimized away. Via reinterpret_casting to char* and copying, float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    char* uip = reinterpret_cast<char*>(&ui);
    float f;
    char* fp = reinterpret_cast<char*>(&f);
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        fp[i] = uip[i];
    }
    return f;
}
 which AFAIK is also legal, as char pointers are exempt from aliasing issues and manual byte copying loop saves a possible function call. The loop will most definitely be unrolled, yet 4 possibly separate one-byte loads/stores are worrisome, I have no idea whether this is optimizable to single four byte load/store. The 4 is the best I've been able to come up with. Am I correct so far? Is there a better way to do this, particulary one that will guarantee single load/store?
@CODE:float std::uint32_t float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
   return /* apply sorcery to ui */;
} reinterpret_cast float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    return reinterpret_cast<float&>(ui);
} float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    return *reinterpret_cast<float*>(&ui);
} union float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    union {
        std::uint32_t ui;
        float f;
    } u = {ui};
    return u.f;
} std::memcpy float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    float f;
    std::memcpy(&f, &ui, 4);
    return f;
} reinterpret_cast char* float reinterpret_as_float(std::uint32_t ui) {
    char* uip = reinterpret_cast<char*>(&ui);
    float f;
    char* fp = reinterpret_cast<char*>(&f);
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        fp[i] = uip[i];
    }
    return f;

@TITLE:AngularJS : minification issue in directive
@CONTENT:I have yet another issue with minification. This time it's because of the $scope service passed to the directive's controller. See below code: angular.module('person.directives').
directive("person", ['$dialog', function($dialog) {
return {
    restrict: "E",
    templateUrl: "person/views/person.html",
    replace: true,

        $scope.test = 3;                   
    }
}
}]);
 If I comment out the controller part, then it works fine. As you can see, I've used the array declaration for the directive, so the $dialog service is known to Angular even after minification. But how am I supposed to do it for the $scope service on the controller ?
@CODE:angular.module('person.directives').
directive("person", ['$dialog', function($dialog) {
return {
    restrict: "E",

 Nothing too complex there... In code I am then doing this: var dyn = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(rawJson);

@CONTENT:The title should say it all. I'm looking for an equivalent to ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} in zsh. Note: I keep finding "$0 is equivalent to ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" around the Internet, but this seems to be false: $0 seems to be the name of the executing command. (It's argv[0], which makes sense.) Echoing $0 in my script (.zshrc) gives zsh for $0, which isn't the same as what ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} is. In fact, ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} seems to work in zsh, except for inside .zshrc files. What I'm really doing in my .zshrc (that isn't working): echo ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
source `dirname $0`/common-shell-rc.sh
 The source fails ($0 is zsh) and the echo outputs a blank line. Edit: apparently, for $0 to work, I need the option FUNCTION_ARGZERO option set. Any way to test if this is set in a script? (so that I can temporarily set it) It is apparently on unless you set nofunction_argzero, and it is on in my shell. Still get nothing for $0. (I think b/c I'm not in a function.)

The description of the meta tags on http://ogp.me/ does not list maximum lengths, only general descriptions such as "A one to two sentence description of your object" for the og:description meta tag. From what I understand, there is no maximum content length for meta tags in general, just recommendations to keep them under certain lengths for SEO reasons.

@TITLE:Backbone change model of View
@CONTENT:I am fairly new to Backbone and have the following question: I have a collection of models. I have a collection view displaying tabs (with a view for each model in the collection). I have a view for a model (for the content). I have a router with routes. What I am trying to achieve is a functionality like http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ I click on a tab (model of collection) and then want to pass the model to the content view maybe change it and reflect the changes in the collection. I came up with four solutions: In the router: 'switchCommunity': function(id) {
        // (a) set new model attributes
        this.view.community.model.set(communities.get(id));

        // (b) replace model
        this.view.community.model = communities.get(id);

        // (c) a custom function of the view changes its model
        this.view.community.changeModel(communities.get(id));

        // (d) a new view
        this.view.community = new View({
            model: communities.get(id)
        })
}
 The problem here is (a) does not reflect changes to the model in the collection (b) does not trigger (change) events, because the bind in the initialize function of the view never triggers, because it is a completly new model (c) seems like a hack to me (d) everytime i click on a tab a new view is created (is this a performance issue?) What is the best pratice here?
@CODE:'switchCommunity': function(id) {
        // (a) set new model attributes
        this.view.community.model.set(communities.get(id));

        // (b) replace model
        this.view.community.model = communities.get(id);

        // (c) a custom function of the view changes its model
        this.view.community.changeModel(communities.get(id));

        // (d) a new view
        this.view.community = new View({
            model: communities.get(id)
        })

When I put it "online" on my server the website is not at the root of the site it self For example: http:// intranet.mycompany.com/inform That's basically the "root" of my folder structure so all my folders starts from there (css file default.cshtml... and so on) My "_PageStart.cshtml" sees it properly cause when I access my site from the link http://intranet.mycompany.com/inform it gives me the Layout I have configured in _PageStart.cshtml (and it really show the layout + the rendered default.cshtml) BUT nothing else is getting the proper path, for example : <img src="~/images/logos/hdr.png" />
 The img holder is there I can see it but shows that the link is broken... when I Right-Click the img holder and do properties to see where the files should be it shows me : http:// intranet.mycompany.com/images/logos/hdr.png So it's going to the "full" root not the relative root...

@LINK:/questions/7714993/https-connection-with-client-certificate-in-an-android-app
@TITLE:HTTPS connection with client certificate in an android app
@CONTENT:I am trying to replace the currently working HTTP connection with a HTTPS connection in a Android app that I am writing. The additional security of a HTTPS connection is necessary and so I cannot ignore this step. I have the following: A server configured to establish a HTTPS connection, and require a client certificate This server has a certificate that is issued by a standard large-scale CA. In short, if I access this connection via the browser in Android, it works fine because the devices truststore recognizes the CA. (So it's not self-signed) A client certificate that is essentially self-signed. (Issued by an internal CA) An Android app that loads this client certificate and attempts to connect to the aforementioned server, but has the following problems/properties: The client can connect to the server when the server is configured to not require a client certificate. Basically, if I use SSLSocketFactory.getSocketFactory() the connection works fine, but the client certificate is a required part of this applications specifications, so: The client produces a javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: No peer certificate exception when I attempt to connect with my custom SSLSocketFactory, but I am not entirely certain why. This exception seems a little ambiguous after searching around the internet for various solutions to this. Here is the relavent code for the client: SSLSocketFactory socketFactory = null;

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    loadCertificateData();
}

private void loadCertificateData() {
    try {
        File[] pfxFiles = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().listFiles(new FileFilter() {
            public boolean accept(File file) {
                if (file.getName().toLowerCase().endsWith("pfx")) {
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        });

        InputStream certificateStream = null;
        if (pfxFiles.length==1) {
            certificateStream = new FileInputStream(pfxFiles[0]);
        }

        KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
        char[] password = "somePassword".toCharArray();
        keyStore.load(certificateStream, password);

        System.out.println("I have loaded [" + keyStore.size() + "] certificates");

        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, password);

        socketFactory = new SSLSocketFactory(keyStore);
    } catch (Exceptions e) {
        // Actually a bunch of catch blocks here, but shortened!
    }
}

    try {
        HttpParams standardParams = new BasicHttpParams();
        HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(standardParams, 5000);
        HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(standardParams, 30000);

        SchemeRegistry schRegistry = new SchemeRegistry();
        schRegistry.register(new Scheme("http", PlainSocketFactory.getSocketFactory(), 80));
        schRegistry.register(new Scheme("https", socketFactory, 443));
        ClientConnectionManager connectionManager = new ThreadSafeClientConnManager(standardParams, schRegistry);

        HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient(connectionManager, standardParams);
        HttpPost request = new HttpPost();
        request.setURI(new URI("https://TheUrlOfTheServerIWantToConnectTo));

        // Catch some exceptions (Actually multiple catch blocks, shortened)
    }
}
 I have verified that, yes indeed the keyStore loads a certificate and is all happy with that. I have two theories as to what I'm missing from reading about HTTPS/SSL connections, but as this is really my first foray, I am a little puzzled as to what I actually need to resolve this issue. The first possibility, as far as I can tell, is that I need to configure this SSLSocketFactory with the devices' truststore that includes all of the standard Intermediate and endpoint Certificate Authorities. That is, the device's default of SSLSocketFactory.getSocketFactory() loads some set of CAs into the factory's truststore that is used to trust the server when it sends its certificate, and that is what is failing in my code, because I do not properly have the trust store loaded. If this is true, how would I best go about loading this data? The second possibility is due to the fact that the client certificate is self-signed (or issued by an internal certificate authority -- correct me if I'm wrong, but these really amount to the same thing, for all intents and purposes here). It is in fact this truststore that I am missing, and basically I need to provide a way for the server to validate the certificate with the internal CA, and also validate that this internal CA is in fact "trustable". If this is true, exactly what sort of thing am I looking for? I have seen some reference to this that makes me believe this may be my problem, as in here, but I am truly not certain. If this is indeed my problem, what would I ask for from the person who maintains the internal CA, and then how would I add this to my code so that my HTTPS connection would work? The third, and hopefully less possible solution, is that I'm entirely wrong about some point here and have missed a crucial step or am completely neglecting a portion of HTTPS/SSL that I just don't currently have any knowledge of. If this is the case, could you please provide me with a bit of a direction so that I can go and learn what it is I need to learn? Thanks for reading!

@LINK:/questions/7561362/what-can-cause-a-program-to-run-much-faster-the-second-time
@TITLE:What can cause a program to run much faster the second time?
@CONTENT:Something I've noticed when testing code I write is that long-running operations tend to run much longer the first time a program is run than on subsequent runs, sometimes by a factor of 10 or more. Obviously there's some sort of cold cache/warm cache issue here, but I can't seem to figure out what it is. It's not the CPU cache, since these long-running operations tend to be loops that I feed a lot of data to, and they should be fully loaded after the first iteration. (Plus, unloading and reloading the program should clear the cache.) Also, it's not the disc cache. I've ruled that out by loading all data from disc up-front and processing it afterwards, and it's the actual CPU-bound data processing that's going slowly. So what can cause my program to run slow the first time I run it, but then if I close it and run it again, it runs dramatically faster? I've seen this in several different programs that do very different things, so it seems to be a general issue. EDIT: For clarification, I'm writing in Delphi, though I don't really think this is a Delphi-specific issue. But that means that whatever the problem is, it's not related to JIT issues, garbage collection issues, or any of the other baggage that managed code brings with it. And I'm not dealing with network connections. This is pure CPU-bound processing. One example: a script compiler. It runs like this: Load entire file into memory from disc Lex the entire file into a queue of tokens Parse the queue into a tree Run codegen on the tree to produce bytecode If I feed it an enormous script file (~100k lines,) after loading the entire thing from disc into memory, the lex step takes about 15 seconds the first time I run, and 2 seconds on subsequent runs. (And yes, I know that's still a long time. I'm working on that...) I'd like to know where that slowdown is coming from and what I can do about it.

Because of this and other reasons (mainly the fact I'm developing a new piece of software and some of the new APIs in Java 7 will be useful) I'm most likely going to switch the existing codebase to use / require Java 7. However there's a fair chunk already written pre-diamond syntax, and I'd like to consistently use the diamond syntax throughout. Is there an IDE shortcut (I'm using Netbeans but obviously can open the project in any free IDE to do the task) or something else that can automatically switch the existing generic code to use diamond syntax?

@CONTENT:Running VS 2010, I want to now build on TFS 2010. In Team Explorer, I change my connection from our old TFS 2008 build server to our new TFS 2010 server. Now I want to map my source control from the old local directory (C:\TFS) to new directory (C:\TFS2010). Using File -> Source Control -> Workspace, I can change the top level mapping of our projects to the new location, clicking the "recursive" check box. However, I notice that while the top level mapping changes, the local paths for the second tier folders don't change. I tried removing all mapping, and I tried refreshing. Tried restarting VS2010. Tried renaming the old directory ¡V that wasn¡¦t allowed. I haven't tried getting latest from the top level, as that would take way too long and i probably don't have that much disk space. Oddly, If I go to File -> Source Control -> Cloak while selecting a second tier project folder, it seems to think the mapping has already been updated for that tier. Any ideas how I can re-map all my projects (or even just some of them), to a different local path?

@TITLE:Link build configuration to a publish profile
@CONTENT:Why does Microsoft not allow you to link a build configuration to a publish profile. Instead it tells you to use the dropdown in the main VS interface. I find this extremely annoying, because we use config transforms to change our config settings based on the environment we are publishing to (such as database connection strings). We also check-in the .Publish.xml file, so that the publish paths are saved in source control. If someone forgets to change the build configuration they could accidentally publish test to production or vice versa. If we could check in the build configuration selection with the publish profile we would not have this issue. Does anyone know if Microsoft plans on changing this in the future?

}


try {
    MailHelper.SendMail(Message);
}
catch (ConfigurationErrorsException exc) {

Is it something vendor specific? I work with MySQL and I didn't find a reference in the MySQL handbook (only questions, mostly unanswered, in the MySQL user forums). On the other hand, I found many references to stored procedures. I have a slightly better grasp of what stored procedures are, although I have never used any. How are the two concepts related? Are they the same thing or does one uses the other? Basically, what is needed is a simple introduction to dynamic SQL for someone who is new to the concept.

@TITLE:ASP.NET controls cannot be referenced in code-behind in Visual Studio 2008
@CONTENT:Ok, so, my visual studio is broken. I say this NOT prematurely, as it was my first response to see where I had messed up in my code. When I add controls to the page I can't reference all of them in the code behind. Some of them I can, it seems that the first few I put on a page work, then it just stops. I first thought it may be the type of control as initially I was trying to reference a repeater inside an update panel. I know I am correctly referencing the code behind in my aspx page. But just in case it was a screw up on my part I started to recreate the page from scratch and this time got a few more controls down before VS stopped recognizing my controls. After creating my page twice and getting stuck I thought maybe it was still the type of controls. I created a new page and just threw some labels on it. No dice, build fails when referencing the control from the code behind. In a possibly unrelated note when I switch to the dreaded "design" mode of the aspx pages VS 2008 errors out and restarts. I have already put a trouble ticket in to Microsoft. I uninstalled all add-ins, I reinstalled visual studio. Anyone that wants to see my code just ask, but I am using the straight WYSIWYG visual studio "new aspx page" nothing fancy. I doubt anyone has run into this, but have you? Has anyone had success trouble shooting these things with Microsoft? Any way to expedite this ticket without paying??? I have been talking to a rep from Microsoft for days with no luck yet and I am dead in the water. Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/1535/reducing-duplicate-error-handling-code-in-c
@TITLE:Reducing duplicate error handling code in C#?
@CONTENT:I've never been completely happy with the way exception handling works, there's a lot exceptions and try/catch brings to the table (stack unwinding, etc.), but it seems to break a lot of the OO model in the process. Anyway, here's the problem: Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc. The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic. Here's an example code snippet: RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10)); bool success = false; while (!success) {     try     {         // do some file IO which may succeed or fail         success = true;     }     catch (IOException e)     {         if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)         {             throw e;         }         fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();     } } So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods: this.RetryFileIO( delegate()     {         // some code block     } ); I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.
@CODE:RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10)); bool success = false; while (!success) {     try     {         // do some file IO which may succeed or fail         success = true;     }     catch (IOException e)     {         if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)         {             throw e;         }         fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();     } } this.RetryFileIO( delegate()     {         // some code block     } ); throw; throw e;

* ~ *    { } /* As above. */
 False! * + * and * ~ * are somehow able to select Paragraph 1 along with 2 and 3! Paragraph 1 isn't preceded by anything, so should be impossible to access: body + * { background: #000; }
body ~ * { background: #000; }
p ~ *    { color: #f00; }
p + *    { font-weight: bold; }
* + *    { text-decoration: underline; }
* ~ *    { font-style: italic; }
 Result: As you can see, paragraph 1 isn't preceded by the body or a phantom p, yet it is apparently preceded by something. It should have no custom styling applied to it at all, yet is somehow affected by those last two selectors. What is the logic behind this? JSFiddle example.
@CODE:<body>
    <p>1</p> <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>2</p> <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>3</p> <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
</body> *        any element
E + F    an F element immediately preceded by an E element
E ~ F    an F element preceded by an E element body + * { } /* Selects nothing as no elements precede body */
body ~ * { } /* As above. */
p + *    { } /* Selects Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 as these are preceded by p */
p ~ *    { } /* As above. */
* + *    { } /* As above. */

@TITLE:Read Assets file as string
@CONTENT:I'm trying to read a assets file as string, I tried like 20 answers here but they don't work for me. I have a file in my assets folder: data.opml, and I have to put the content in a string. I send it like:  OPML.importFromFile(string, MainTabActivity.this);
 And receive it like:  importFromFile(String filename, Context context); 
 Something that did work (but it's not a assets file):  OPML.importFromFile(new StringBuilder(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString()).append(File.separator).append(fileNames[which]).toString(),MainTabActivity.this);
 I've tried:  AssetFileDescriptor descriptor = getAssets().openFd("data.opml");
 FileReader reader = new FileReader(descriptor.getFileDescriptor());
 And also:
 InputStream input = getAssets().open("data.opml");
 Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(input, "UTF-8");
 Maby I'm doing something wrong, but it just won't work because it the project gives errors (respectively: OPML is not capable for the arguments filereader and reader) , If somebody knows how to do this, it would be very appreciated!

@CONTENT:I've just updated RVM, and in place of the old .rvmrc, it auto-created .ruby-gemset and .ruby-version. I've always had .rvmrc files with contents like rvm use --create default@project_name. However, .ruby-version contains the specific Ruby version I'm running rather than default. I'm hesitant to check this in. Also, I heard someone say on a podcast that one shouldn't check in .ruby-gemset because others may have their own preferences about how to name gemsets. When should or shouldn't I check in .ruby-gemset and/or .ruby-version? Specifically: What are some of the tradeoffs? How does the type of project affect the decision (for example, applications vs gems)? If they should be checked in, how does the type of project affect what should go in these files? Citations from from the creators of tools like rvm, rbenv, etc would be appreciated in an answer.

@LINK:/questions/14897247/jquery-stuck-at-cors-preflight-and-iis-ghost-response
@TITLE:JQuery stuck at CORS preflight and IIS ghost response
@CONTENT:I'm stuck. Seriously... - solved. read on :) Scenario: I'm trying to do the right thing here. I added CORS functionality to my REST Service (ASP.NET Web-API) relying on the Thinktecture Identitymodel CORS DelegatingHandler. So far so good. To actually test if it is working I did the following: I set up a simple HTML page and published it on a different host than the rest service (xttp://otherhost/simplewebpage). The page uses JQuery to make the sample request. Code see below. Next I set up my rest service to not use iis express but rather the fully blown instance of it running on my development machine (xttp://developmenthost/restservice). Last but not least on my development machine I open up the xttp://otherhost/simplewebpage and fire the Ajax request. The error callback is executed telling me there was a "transport error" (IE9) or "" (empty string) in Chrome. I made sure there's no proxy related connectivity issue or anything like that. So I went forth and looked at the Fiddler traces and IIS logs. Fiddler says there is no GET /rest/hello request but rather a OPTIONS /rest/hello request - which is totally fine and expected! However the response to the OPTIONS request is rather intriguing! The whole response header looks like this: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
Public: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST
Date: Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:09:27 GMT
Content-Length: 0
 This is of course nowhere even close to the expected response. The fun part about this is, that the Request didn't even hit Application_BeginRequest() in my application. So there's no way my application could be responsible for that result. I can see the request in my IIS logs and IIS adds the Powered-by-ASP.NET header.. so it definitely passes through (the right) IIS site. The JQuery code that triggers the ajax request:     function Run()
    {
        $.ajax({
            type: 'GET',
            url: url,
            dataType: "json",
            beforeSend: function(jqXhr) {
                jqXhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + getBasicHttpEncodedString(userName, password));
                jqXhr.setRequestHeader("Api-Key", "123");
            },
            success: successCallback,
            error: errorCallback,
            timeout: 180*1000
        });
    }
 The resulting OPTIONS request looks like that: OPTIONS http://services.dev13/Rest/Hello HTTP/1.1
Host: developmenthost
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Request-Method: GET
Origin: http://otherhost/simplewebpage
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1312.57 Safari/537.17

Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
 ... and you have already seen the response to that above. Any idea who exactly answers my OPTIONS request? Or is my JQuery code flawed? The REST Service works just fine if I use for example Postman (Google Chrome App) or if I forge Requests in Fiddler (That's probably because they don't do CORS negotiation - there's no OPTIONS request). Update #1: Earlier today I read somewhere that disabling WebDAV is mandatory because it interferes with OPTIONS requests. My IIS Role Services view tells me WebDAV Publishing is Not installed. * Update #2:* Problem solved?? I dug deeper. There's a module registered in IIS that is responsible for the "undesired(?)" response to the OPTIONS request. Its name is "OPTIONSVerbHandler" (handler: ProtocolSupportModule). If I disable that module the request passes through to my application. There a more meaningful response is created and then followed by the actual GET request! YAY! HTTP/1.1 200 OK

I'm teaching a jr. high/high school web programming class, and we're starting with simple elements and attributes like font and color before moving on to CSS. I know color is deprecated and font is not included in HTML5, but for teaching purposes, I find it convenient to start with simple HTML tags and work our way up to CSS. The students get a lot of joy out of being able to change colors on a page during the first week of class. (I also teach them marquee and blink in week 1, but inform them that if they ever use them again, they will lose points). One of the students started submitting homework with odd things in the color attribute values, like "Skittles" or "Spiderman". I started experimenting with this and discovered that just about anything you put into the color="" attribute on the font tag produces some sort of color. And it appears that the color is consistent across the latest versions of IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. I have discovered that putting "LuckyCharms" in as a CSS color DOES NOT WORK. It only seems to work where colors are expected in HTML attributes, for example font color="LuckyCharms", or body bgcolor="LuckyCharms". I'm trying to explain to my class why this happens, and so far I haven't been able to make sense of it, or to Google a good answer. It would appear that it's being interpreted as a color code, but I can't make sense of how. UPDATE: After some trial and error, I have determined a 5-step algorithm (using the link provided) to convert pretty much any string into the corresponding hex color. I will provide the algorithm here for the edification of future visitors: Change each non-hex character to a 0. Add 0's to the string until its length is a multiple of 3. Divide string into 3 equal parts. While the length of the sub-strings is greater than 2, and all three of the sub-strings begin with a 0, remove the leading 0s from each string. If the length of the sub-strings is still greater than 2, then truncate each substring to 2 characters. That's it, put the substrings together and you've got your hex color code. I have verified this algorithm with about 20 different samples and compared the results using the Firefox ColorZilla add-on color picker. Note that in this case, the rules ARE indeed specifically stated in the link specified in one of the answers and will be adhered to by all browsers. So it is something you can count on to work in any browser (should you really want to use funny color names).

@TITLE:Selecting both MIN and MAX From the Table is slower than expected
@CONTENT:I have a table MYTABLE with a date column SDATE which is the primary key of the table and has a unique index on it. When I run this query: SELECT MIN(SDATE) FROM MYTABLE
 it gives answer instantly. The same happens for: SELECT MAX(SDATE) FROM MYTABLE
 But, if I query both together: SELECT MIN(SDATE), MAX(SDATE) FROM MYTABLE
 it takes much more time to execute. I analyzed the plans and found when one of min or max is queried, it uses INDEX FULL SCAN(MIN/MAX) but when both are queried at the same time, it does a FULL TABLE SCAN. why? Test Data: version 11g create table MYTABLE

@CONTENT:I have the Activity and the Service. When Activity is started, it calls startService() to make this Service be alive even when Activity is destroyed, and bindService(), to communicate with this Service. bindService() returns true, mService.onBind() is called, and ServiceConnection.onServiceConnected() is called too. All works. When i destroy my Activity by pressing Back key, it calls unbindService(), and my mService.onUnbind() is called. (i return false in this onUnbind().) Then i start this Activity again, bindService() returns true, and then mService.onBind() is NOT called! But ServiceConnection.onServiceConnected() is called too, and all works again. It looks like Dalvik remembers what my onBind() returned last time, and just does not call onBind() again. When i destroy my Activity again, onUnbind() is NOT called too. I can bind and unbind this Service to my Activity any number of times, but these methods will not be called anymore until I destroy Service by unbinding and calling stopService(). In docs i can't find any explanation of this behavior. Conversely, this figure shows that onBind() and onUnbind() should be called every time clients bind and unbind Service. This figure can be found on the bottom of this Dev Guide.

@TITLE:Why doesn't this thread pool get garbage collected?
@CONTENT:In this code example, the ExecutorService is used one and allowed to go out of scope. public static void main(String[] args)

    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
    executorService.submit(new Runnable()

 Once executorService is out of scope, it should get collected and finalized. The finalize() method in ThreadPoolExecutor calls shutdown(). /**
 * Invokes {@code shutdown} when this executor is no longer
 * referenced and it has no threads.
 */
protected void finalize() {
    shutdown();
}
 Once shutdown() is called, the pool threads should terminate and the JVM should be allowed to exit. However the executorSerivce is never getting collected and thus the JVM stays alive. Even calls to System.gc() don't seem to work. Why isn't executorService getting collected even after main() terminates? Note: I know I should call shutdown() myself and I always do outside of testing. I'm curious why finalization isn't working as a back-up here.

@CONTENT:I am building a "check-out" like interaction with jQuery UI tabs. This means that the click of a button on the first tab will deactivate the first tab and move to the next. I have been combing through the posts on Stack Overflow but nothing I try seems to work. I am using jQuery UI 1.8, here is the code:   <script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function() {

    }); 
    $("#confirm").click(function(){
        $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected', 2);
        $("#tabs").tabs({disabled: [0,1]});
    }); 
  });
  </script>

<div id="tabs">

    <div id="fragment-3">
        tab 3, index 2
    </div>

 When I click the buttons, the next tab becomes unlocked (in that it is selectable) but it does not disable the tab at index 0 and switch to the tab at index 1. Also, the corresponding panel does not show. Can someone please offer some advice on this?

@CONTENT:I'm trying to build an implementation agnostic maven module which relies on JPA2. Unfortunately, the only Maven JPA dependency is JPA1 based, and consequently, I cannot use EntityManager.detach() method as that is a JPA2 option only. Ideally, I'd love to be able to specify my javax.persistence dependency in my Pom, and require the app/container to supply the JPA2 implementation. Unfortunately, I cannot find any such dependency. Is my only choice at this point to declare hibernate-jpa-2.0-api 1.0.0.FINAL as a provided dependency?

class Topic(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    ...

class Post(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    ...
 Now say I want to see how many topics and posts each users of subset of users has (e.g. their username starts with "ab"). So if I do one query for each post and topic: User.objects.filter(username_startswith="ab")
            .annotate(posts=Count('post'))
            .values_list("username","posts")
 Yeilds: [('abe', 5),('abby', 12),...]
 and User.objects.filter(username_startswith="ab")
            .annotate(topics=Count('topic'))
            .values_list("username","topics")
 Yields: [('abe', 2),('abby', 6),...]
 HOWEVER, when I try annotating both to get one list, I get something strange: User.objects.filter(username_startswith="ab")
            .annotate(posts=Count('post'))
            .annotate(topics=Count('topic'))
            .values_list("username","posts", "topics")
 Yields: [('abe', 10, 10),('abby', 72, 72),...]
 Why are the topics and posts multiplied together? I expected this: [('abe', 5, 2),('abby', 12, 6),...]
 What would be the best way of getting the correct list?
@CODE:class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=25)

@CONTENT:I've started using UIDocumentInteractionController for a new app but I'm wondering how to add additional actions to the action menu that you get on the preview screen? It seems that the menu only lists apps that have registered for a given url type plus I'm seeing PRINT showing up on iOS4.2. I would like to add send by email and save to photos but don't see a way of extending this menu. I can code the actions I want OK, it's just adding them into the menu that seems impossible? Am I missing something obvious?

@TITLE:Backbone.js: Why isn't this event bound?
@CONTENT:I have a simple todo list, and all is rendering as expected, but when I click on the submit button in the edit form, the form is submitted (GET /todo_items), and the page is reloaded an only shows the edit form. The "submit form" event isn't being bound and I can't figure out why. What am I missing? App.Views.Edit = Backbone.View.extend({

@TITLE:Standard library containers producing a lot of copies on rvalues in GCC
@CONTENT:I'm writing a app for both linux & windows, and noticed that the GCC build is producing a lot of useless calls to the copy constructor. Here's an example code to produce this behavior: struct A
{
    A()                { std::cout << "default" << std::endl; }
    A(A&& rvalue)      { std::cout << "move"    << std::endl; }
    A(const A& lvalue) { std::cout << "copy"    << std::endl; }
    A& operator =(A a) { std::cout << "assign"  << std::endl; return *this; }
};

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(test_copy_semantics)
{
    std::vector<A> vec_a( 3 );
}
 This test just creates a vector of 3 elements. I expect 3 default constructor calls and 0 copies as there are no A lvalues. In Visual C++ 2010, the output is: default
move
default
move
default
move
 In GCC 4.4.0 (MinGW), (-O2 -std=c++0x), the output is: default
copy
copy
copy
 What is going on and how do I fix it? Copies are expensive for the actual class, default construction and moves are cheap.
@CODE:struct A
{
    A()                { std::cout << "default" << std::endl; }
    A(A&& rvalue)      { std::cout << "move"    << std::endl; }
    A(const A& lvalue) { std::cout << "copy"    << std::endl; }
    A& operator =(A a) { std::cout << "assign"  << std::endl; return *this; }
};

This is a example method, in the future the file could be stored in a BLOB in the database:         public void GetFile(HttpResponse response)
    {
        String fileName = "example.iso";

                response.Flush();
            }
        }
    }
 But, I'm not sure if this is correct or there is a better way to do it. My questions are: When I open the url with the browser, appears the "Save File" dialog... but it seems like the server has started already to push data into the stream before I click "Save", is that normal? If I remove the line"response.Flush()", when I open the url with the browser, ... I see how the web server is pushing data but the "Save File" dialog doesn't come up, (or at least not in a reasonable time fashion) why? When I open the url with a WebRequest object, I see that the HttpResponse.ContentLength is "-1", although I can read the stream and get the file. What is the meaning of -1? When is HttpResponse.ContentLength going to show the length of the response? For example, I have a method that retrieves a big xml compresed with deflate as a binary stream, but in that case... when I access it with a WebRequest, in the HttpResponse I can actually see the ContentLength with the length of the stream, why? What is the optimal length for the Byte[] array that I use as buffer for optimal performance in a web server? I've read that is between 4K and 8K... but which factors should I consider to make the correct decision. Does this method bloat the IIS or client memory usage? or is it actually buffering the transference correctly? Sorry for so many questions, I'm pretty new in web development :P Cheers.
@CODE:public void GetFile(HttpResponse response)
    {
        String fileName = "example.iso";
        response.ClearHeaders();
        response.ClearContent();
        response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream";
        response.AppendHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + fileName);
        using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(Path.Combine(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/App_Data"), fileName), FileMode.Open))
        {
            Byte[] buffer = new Byte[4096];
            Int32 readed = 0;

            while ((readed = fs.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                response.OutputStream.Write(buffer, 0, readed);
                response.Flush();

@TITLE:How to specify the parent query field from within a subquery in mySQL?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to specify the parent query field from within a subquery in mySQL? For Example: I have written a basic Bulletin Board type program in PHP. In the database each post contains: id(PK) and parent_id(the id of the parent post). If the post is itself a parent, then its parent_id is set to 0. I am trying to write a mySQL query that will find every parent post and the number of children that the parent has. $query = "SELECT id, (
      SELECT COUNT(1) 
      FROM post_table 
      WHERE parent_id = id
) as num_children
FROM post_table
WHERE parent_id = 0";
 The tricky part is that the first id doesn't know that it should be referring to the second id that is outside of the subquery. I know that I can do SELECT id AS id_tmp and then refer to it inside the subquery, but then if I want to also return the id and keep "id" as the column name, then I'd have to do a query that returns me 2 columns with the same data (which seems messy to me) $query = "SELECT id, id AS id_tmp, 
            (SELECT COUNT(1)
            FROM post_table
            WHERE parent_id = id_tmp) as num_children
         FROM post_table
         WHERE parent_id = 0";
 The messy way works fine, but I feel an opportunity to learn something here so I thought I'd post the question.

      SELECT COUNT(1)

@TITLE:How do I add space between items in an ASP.NET RadioButtonList
@CONTENT:I've got an ASP.NET RadioButtonList that displays four items using RepeatDirection="Horizontal" to display them on a single line. I'm using RepeatLayout="Flow" to avoid the markup for a table. However, this causes the items in the list to be placed right next to each other, which does not look good. So, I tried the table layout to take advantage of the CellSpacing and/or CellPadding properties. Unfortunately, these properties affect both the vertical and horizontal spacing/padding within the table, so while I get the horizontal spacing, I also get undesired vertical spacing. At this point, I'm down to this: <asp:RadioButtonList ID="rblMyRadioButtonList" runat="server" 
    RepeatDirection="Horizontal"
    RepeatLayout="Flow" >
    <asp:ListItem Selected="false" Text="Item One&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Value="Item_1" />

@CONTENT:How does one interface a 'go' program with a C library? I've been browsing go's source code but I still didn't figured it out. If someone has already done so, could you share, please? UPDATED: Thanks to @fserb, I am posting some documentation from the 'go' sources: Cgo enables the creation of Go packages that call C code. Usage: cgo [compiler options] file.go The compiler options are passed through uninterpreted when invoking gcc to compile the C parts of the package. The input file.go is a syntactically valid Go source file that imports the pseudo-package "C" and then refers to types such as C.size_t, variables such as C.stdout, or functions such as C.putchar. If the import of "C" is immediately preceded by a comment, that comment is used as a header when compiling the C parts of the package. For example: // #include <stdio.h>
// #include <errno.h>
import "C"
 Cgo transforms the input file into four output files: two Go source files, a C file for 6c (or 8c or 5c), and a C file for gcc. The standard package makefile rules in Make.pkg automate the process of using cgo. See $GOROOT/misc/cgo/stdio and $GOROOT/misc/cgo/gmp for examples. Cgo does not yet work with gccgo.

I'm supposed to find certain patterns inside an expression, and simplify them so the number of parenthesis inside the expression decreases. So far I've been able to implement most rules except two, for which I've decided to create a recursive, pattern-matching "filter" function. The two rules I need to implement are: -Turn all expressions of the form a - (b + c) or similar into a - b - c -Turn all expressions of the form a / (b * c) or similar into a / b / c ...which I suspect would be fairly simple, and once I've managed to implement one, I can implement the other easily. However, I'm having trouble with the recursive pattern-matching function. My type expression is this: type expr =

 And what I'm mainly having trouble on, is in the match expression. For example, I'm trying something like this: let rec filter exp =   
    match exp with       
    | Var v -> Var v                      	
    | Sum(e1, e2) -> Sum(e1, e2) 		  
    | Prod(e1, e2) -> Prod(e1, e2)
    | Diff(e1, e2) ->
	    match e2 with
	    | Sum(e3, e4) -> filter (diffRule e2)
	    | Diff(e3, e4) -> filter (diffRule e2)      
	    | _ -> filter e2         
    | Quot(e1, e2) ->                                 ***this line***
	    match e2 with  
	    | Quot(e3, e4) -> filter (quotRule e2)        
	    | Prod(e3, e4) -> filter (quotRule e2)        
	    | _ -> filter e2
;;
 However, it seems that the match expression on the marked line is being recognized as being part of the previous "inner match" instead of the "principal match", so all "Quot(...)" expressions are never recognized. Is it even possible to have match expressions inside other match expressions like this? And what would be the correct way to end the inner match so I can continue matching the other possibilities? Ignore the logic, since it's pretty much what I came up with first, it's just that I haven't been able to try it since I have to deal with this "match" error first, although any recommendation on how to handle the recursiveness or the logic would be welcome.
@CODE:type expr =
 | Var of string    		(* variable *)
 | Sum of expr * expr   	(* sum  *)
 | Diff of expr * expr  	(* difference *)
 | Prod of expr * expr  	(* product *)
 | Quot of expr * expr  	(* quotient *)
;; let rec filter exp =   
    match exp with       
    | Var v -> Var v                      	
    | Sum(e1, e2) -> Sum(e1, e2) 		  
    | Prod(e1, e2) -> Prod(e1, e2)

@TITLE:Is DataGrid a necessity in WPF?
@CONTENT:I have seen a lot of discussions going on and people asking about DataGrid for WPF and complaining about Microsoft for not having one with their WPF framework till date. We know that WPF is a great UI technology and have the Concept of ItemsControl,DataTemplate, etc,etc to make great UX. Even WPF has got a more closely matching control- ListView, which can be easily templated to give better UX than a traditional Datagrid like display. And I would say a readymade DataGrid control will kill or hide a lot of creativity and it surely will decrease the innovations in User Experience field. So what is your opinion about the need of DataGrid in WPF as a Framework component? If you feel it is necessary then is it just because the world is so used to the DatGrid way of data display for many years?

@LINK:/questions/28286086/default-securityprotocol-in-net-4-5
@TITLE:Default SecurityProtocol in .NET 4.5
@CONTENT:What is the default security protocol for communicating with servers that support up to TLS 1.2? Will .NET by default, choose the highest security protocol supported on the server side or do I have to explicitly add this line of code: System.Net.ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = 
SecurityProtocolType.Tls | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
 Is there a way to change this default, besides a code change? Lastly, does .NET 4.0 only support up to TLS 1.0? i.e. I have to upgrade client projects to 4.5 to support TLS 1.2. My motivation is to remove support for SSLv3 on the client side even if server supports it (I already have a powershell script to disable this in the machine registry) and to support the highest TLS protocol that the server supports. Update: Looking at the ServicePointManager class in .NET 4.0 I see no enumerated values for TLS 1.0 and 1.1. In both .NET 4.0/4.5, the default is SecurityProtocolType.Tls|SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3. Hopefully this default won't break by disabling SSLv3 in the registry. However, I've decided I have to upgrade all apps to .NET 4.5 and to explicitly add SecurityProtocolType.Tls | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12; anyway to all bootstrapping code of all applications. This will make outbound requests to various apis and services to not downgrade to SSLv3 and should select the highest level of TLS. Does this approach sound reasonable or overkill? I have many applications to update, and I want to future proof them since I hear even TLS 1.0 may be deprecated in the near future by some providers. As a client making outbound requests to APIs, does disabling SSL3 in the registry even have an effect in the .NET framework? I see by default, TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are not enabled, do we have to enable it via the registry? RE http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030. After a bit of investigation, I believe the registry settings will have no affect since they apply to IIS (server subkey) and browsers (client subkey). Sorry this post turned into multiple questions, followed up with "maybe" answers.

@TITLE:Using Function.prototype.bind with an array of arguments?
@CONTENT:How can I call Function.prototype.bind with an array of arguments, as opposed to hardcoded arguments? (Not using ECMA6, so no spread operator). I'm trying to put a promises wrapper around a module that uses callbacks and I want to bind all of the arguments passed in to my wrapper method and bind them. Then I want to call the partially applied bound function with my own callback, which will resolve or reject a promise. var find = function() {
  var deferred, bound;
  deferred = Q.defer();
  bound = db.find.bind(null, arguments);
  bound(function(err, docs) {
    if(err) {
      deferred.fail(err);
    } else {
      deferred.resolve(docs);
    }
  });
  return deferred.promise;
}
 But obviously this doesn't work because bind expects arguments rather than an array of arguments. I know I could do this by inserting my callback onto the end of the arguments array and using apply: arguments[arguments.length] = function(err, docs) { ... }
db.find.apply(null, arguments);
 Or by iterating over the arguments array and rebinding the function for each argument: var bound, context;
for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
   context = bound ? bound : db.find;
   bound = context.bind(null, arguments[i]);
}
bound(function(err, docs) { ... })
 But both of these methods feel dirty. Any ideas?
@CODE:var find = function() {
  var deferred, bound;
  deferred = Q.defer();
  bound = db.find.bind(null, arguments);
  bound(function(err, docs) {
    if(err) {
      deferred.fail(err);
    } else {
      deferred.resolve(docs);
    }
  });
  return deferred.promise;
} arguments[arguments.length] = function(err, docs) { ... }
db.find.apply(null, arguments); var bound, context;
for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
   context = bound ? bound : db.find;
   bound = context.bind(null, arguments[i]);

@TITLE:How to create a Play 2.2 Scala application as an SBT sub-project
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a Scala application consisting of a library project (let's call this common), a Thrift server project (let's call this server) and a Play web application project (hereinafter known as web). All three are written in Scala and built with sbt. My project structure looks like this: myproject/
-common/
  ...
-server/
  ...
-web/
  -app/
  -conf/
  ...
-project/
  -Build.scala
  -build.properties
-build.sbt
 My build.sbt file (simplified a bit) looks like this: import play.Project._

name := "myproject"

version := "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

lazy val common = project

lazy val web = project
    .settings(playScalaSettings: _*)
    .dependsOn(common)

lazy val server = project
    .dependsOn(common)

lazy val root = project.in(file("."))
    .aggregate(common, web, server)
 The problem with this is that the root project is not a Play project, so the play command does not work (it errors out with java.lang.RuntimeException: */*:playRunHooks is undefined.
at scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:27)
 I can fix this by making the root project look like a Play project if I insert the line playScalaSettings after the version line in the SBT file, but then I have another problem: the play run command attempts to run the root project, not the web subproject. Obviously the play run command does not work when run in the web subdirectory since there is no SBT file there to describe the project and its dependencies. I am looking for a solution that allows me to retain this project structure (meaning the Play project is one of many sub-projects in my application), while retaining all the Play framework hotness like hot updates when code changes (even code in dependent libraries like common). I thought I found the solution by running play to get the interactive console, and then  project web
 run
 That works, but it doesn't work on the command line. play web/run for some reason runs the root level run command, which as noted above does not work because the root application is not a Play application. Note: A similar question was asked before in the context of Play 2.0 at Play Framework as SBT Non-Root Module, but the answer is not satisfactory, nor do I believe it is still correct as of Play 2.2.

@CONTENT:I would like to have a table which in the columns can stretch but I'm having a little trouble with min and max width in css. It also seems that theres some conflicting answers around how this works: min/max width should work: table td width under control min/max width are unsupported: Min-width and max-height for table atrributes I would like to have the following table{

I will add the v4 directly to the project now to see if it solve, but I want to know: I don't really understand from the documentation if libraries are redundant or complementing?

It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
 But if u say i should not add v4 if already have v7 how do I explain it to Eclipse? Relevant post, the solution was to add v4 here. The hierarchy of the type activity is inconsistent when extending ActionBarActivity Edit 2: The v4 jar is included in the v7 library project if done following these steps point by point: http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#add-library My setup is : Android 4.3 : unchecked APrivate Lib: unchecked v7-app.../src : checked v7-app.../gen : checked ADependencie: unchecked raw v7 jar : check raw v4 jar : check

@TITLE:Future-compatible enums in 2.7?
@CONTENT:Many methods of implementing enums are shown in the answers to this question. However, PEP0435 is out now and describes how Enum and IntEnum will become official in Python 3.4. My question is not about the advantages/disadvantages of particular ways of simulating enums in Python. Rather I'd like advice on the most forward-compatibile way for those of us still stuck in 2.X releases. flufl.enum was originally going to be the reference implementation but was dropped due to members not being instances of the type (and of allowing subclasses with additional members at the same time). The latter wouldn't affect much day-to-day but perhaps the former would cause more issues? Are there any libraries out there that more closely resemble what is being added to 3.4 and are compatible with 2.7+?

@TITLE:Ajax post to ASP.net MVC controller - object properties are null
@CONTENT:I've got an ajax post being constructed like this: var myData = [
    {
        id: "a",
        name: "Name 1"
    },
    {
        id: "b",

];

$.ajax({

    data: { items: myData },
    dataType: 'json',
    error: function (err) {
        alert("error - " + err);
    }
});
 And an MVC controller: [HttpPost]
public JsonResult MyAction(MyClass[] items)
{

}
 MyClass is just a simple representation of the data: public class MyClass {
    public string Name {get; set; }
    public string Id {get; set; }
}
 When the javascript makes the post request, the controller action does indeed receive 2 items, however the properties (id, name) in these items are null. Checking the request in fiddler, the body looks like this: Name                 | Value
items[0][Name]       | Name 1
items[0][Id]         | a
items[1][Name]       | Name 2
items[1][Id]         | b
 Have I missed something?

@CONTENT:I was trying to answer an issue with custom drop down, but challenged by an inconsistent behavior in Chrome and FF. DEMO: http://jsfiddle.net/fyeht/ [Added scroll event for more clarity] See below image, The list items can be navigated using arrow keys. To Reproduce the issue: Open console in Chrome (F12) Click on an item in the list (you would notice some events getting logged in the console) Use down arrow key to navigate to the next item in the list Finally, the issue is noticed when you reach the last item in the view and hitting down arrow would scroll. Check the log to see 'scroll', 'mouse enter' and 'mouse move' [check the new demo] The issue is after reaching the end of items in view, it scrolls. Even though the mouse is untouched, it triggers mouseenter and mousemove events in Chrome. In FF, on scroll it triggers just the mouseenter which make sense. Question(s): Why is mousemove triggered when mouse is untouched? Is this just browser inconsistency? Could not find documentation on events triggered when scrolling?

@TITLE:Await a Async Void method call for unit testing
@CONTENT:I have a method that looks like this: private async void DoStuff(long idToLookUp)
{
    IOrder order = await orderService.LookUpIdAsync(idToLookUp);   

    // Close the search
    IsSearchShowing = false;
}    

//Other stuff in case you want to see it
public DelegateCommand<long> DoLookupCommand{ get; set; }
ViewModel()
{
     DoLookupCommand= new DelegateCommand<long>(DoStuff);
}    
 I am trying to unit test it like this: [TestMethod]
public void TestDoStuff()
{
    //+ Arrange
    myViewModel.IsSearchShowing = true;

    // container is my Unity container and it setup in the init method.
    container.Resolve<IOrderService>().Returns(orderService);
    orderService = Substitute.For<IOrderService>();
    orderService.LookUpIdAsync(Arg.Any<long>())
                .Returns(new Task<IOrder>(() => null));

    //+ Act
    myViewModel.DoLookupCommand.Execute(0);

    //+ Assert
    myViewModel.IsSearchShowing.Should().BeFalse();
}
 My assert is called before I get done with the mocked up LookUpIdAsync. In my normal code, that is just what I want. But for my Unit test I don't want that. I am converting to Async/Await from using BackgroundWorker. With background worker this was functioning correctly because I could wait for the BackgroundWorker to finish. But there does not seem to be a way to wait for a async void method... How can I unit test this method?
@CODE:private async void DoStuff(long idToLookUp)
{
    IOrder order = await orderService.LookUpIdAsync(idToLookUp);   

    // Close the search
    IsSearchShowing = false;

@TITLE:How to pass std::unique_ptr around?
@CONTENT:I am having my first attempt at using C++11 unique_ptr; I am replacing a polymorphic raw pointer inside a project of mine, which is owned by one class, but passed around quite frequently. I used to have functions like: bool func(BaseClass* ptr, int other_arg) {
  bool val;
  // plain ordinary function that does someting...
  return val;
}
 But I soon realized that I wouldn't be able to switch to: bool func(std::unique_ptr<BaseClass> ptr, int other_arg);
 Because the caller would have to handle the pointer ownership to the function, what I don't want to. So, what is the best solution to my problem? I though of passing the pointer as reference, like this: bool func(const std::unique_ptr<BaseClass>& ptr, int other_arg);
 But I feel very uncomfortable in doing so, firstly because it seems non instinctive to pass something already typed as _ptr as reference, what would be a reference of a reference. Secondly because the function signature gets even bigger. Thirdly, because in the generated code, it would be necessary two consecutive pointer indirections to reach my variable.
@CODE:unique_ptr bool func(BaseClass* ptr, int other_arg) {
  bool val;
  // plain ordinary function that does someting...
  return val;

box()
 Produces a nice frame around a map. It would be even nicer to make the degree symbol superscript. This can usually be done in other plotting functions such as mtext() and text() using expression(paste(...)) or substitute() but how to do it in this case?

@TITLE:What is the appropriate HTTP status code response for a general unsuccessful request (not an error)?
@CONTENT:I'm creating a RESTful API that will process a number of user interactions, including placing orders using stored credit cards. In the case of a successful order, I'm returning a 200 OK, and in the case where the order request is malformed or invalid I'm returning a 400 Bad Request. But what should I return if there is a problem during the actual processing of the order? Client POSTS order to server for a user resource. If user does not exist, 404 Not Found is returned. Order format and information is validated. If not valid, 400 Bad Request is returned. Order is processed. If the order is successful, a 201 Created is returned for the order. If an unexpected error is encountered, a 500 Server Error is returned. The last step is the problem - what do I return if the order doesn't complete for any other reason? Possible scenarios could include: Product is sold out User maximum order limit reached Credit card transaction failure (insufficient funds, etc.) This doesn't seem like it would be appropriate for either a 400 or 500. If anything I could see it as a 400 if there's no better code - the request was invalid according to the business rules. It just doesn't seem accurate. Edit: Also found this existing discussion of the same topic. All of the answers there seem to point to using status codes for this type of violation, with some discussion between using 400, 409, or the 422 extension.

@TITLE:What is the pythonic way to read CSV file data as rows of namedtuples?
@CONTENT:What is the best way to take a data file that contains a header row and read this row into a named tuple so that the data rows can be accessed by header name? I was attempting something like this: import csv
from collections import namedtuple

with open('data_file.txt', mode="r") as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    Data = namedtuple("Data", ", ".join(i for i in reader[0]))
    next(reader)
    for row in reader:
        data = Data(*row)
 The reader object is not subscriptable, so the above code throws a TypeError. What is the pythonic way to reader a file header into a namedtuple?
@CODE:import csv
from collections import namedtuple

with open('data_file.txt', mode="r") as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    Data = namedtuple("Data", ", ".join(i for i in reader[0]))

@CONTENT:The Game Boy Z80 CPU has a half-carry flag, and I can't seem to find much information about when to set/clear it. What I understand so far is that any 8-bit add, subtract, shift, or rotate operation (and maybe others?) set it to bit 4 of the result(?), and the DAA instruction sets/uses this somehow. What I'm not sure is how 16-bit instructions affect it and whether it's affected or not by the use of certain registers.

@TITLE:Delphi Ownership Confusion
@CONTENT:I always thought that the owner is responsible for destroying visual controls and that I can manually control destruction if I pass nil as the owner. Consider the following example: TMyForm = class (TForm)
private
  FButton : TButton;
end;

...
FButton := TButton.Create(nil);   // no owner!!
FButton.Parent := Self;
 I would expect this button to produce a memory leak but it doesn't and in fact the destructor of TButton is called. Further investigation showed that the TWinControl destructor contains the following snippet of code: I := ControlCount;
while I <> 0 do
begin
  Instance := Controls[I - 1];
  Remove(Instance);
  Instance.Destroy;
  I := ControlCount;
end;
 which looks like it is destroying the child components (the ones with Parent set to the control itself). I was not expecting the parent control to destroy the control. Can anybody explain why this is happening? And who is destroying the object if I pass in an owner?
@CODE:nil TMyForm = class (TForm)
private
  FButton : TButton;
end;

...
FButton := TButton.Create(nil);   // no owner!!

@TITLE:Ruby on Rails memory leak when looping through large number of records; find_each doesn't help
@CONTENT:I have a Rails app that processes a large (millions) number of records in a mysql database. Once it starts working, its memory use quickly grows at a speed of 50MB per second. With tools like oink I was able to narrow down the root cause to one loop that goes through all the records in a big table in the database. I understand if I use something like Person.all.each, all the records will be loaded into memory. However if I switch to find_each, I still see the same memory issue. To further isolate the problem I created the following test controller, which does nothing but looping through the records. I suppose find_each only keeps a small number of objects in memory each time, but memory use grows linearly as it executes. class TestController < ApplicationController
  def memory_test
    Person.find_each do |person|
    end
end
 I suspect it has to do with ActiveRecord caching the query results. But I checked my environment settings and I do have all the caching related options set to false in development (I am using the default settings created by rails). I did some search online but couldn't find a solution. I am using rails 3.1.0 rc1 and ruby 1.9.2 Thanks!

@TITLE:Boost 1.46.1, Property Tree: How to iterate through ptree receiving sub ptrees?
@CONTENT:First of all I shall say that I think I got how it should be done but my code will not compile any way I try. I based my assumption on this official example of empty ptree trick. There you can find next line:   const ptree &settings = pt.get_child("settings", empty_ptree<ptree>());
 Which shows that it is (or should be) possible to get subptree out from ptree. So I assumed we could iterate thru ptree with something like BOOST_FOREACH in such manner: BOOST_FOREACH(const boost::property_tree::ptree &v,
    config.get_child("servecies"))
{

}
 But I get next error: Error 1 error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'std::pair<_Ty1,_Ty2>' to 'const boost::property_tree::ptree &' or if I try BOOST_FOREACH(boost::property_tree::ptree &v,
    config.get_child("servecies", boost::property_tree::empty_ptree<boost::property_tree::ptree>()))
{

}
 I get: Error 1 error C2039: 'empty_ptree' : is not a member of 'boost::property_tree' So what shall I do: how to iterate thru Boost Ptree and get sub Ptrees? Update: I also tried such code     BOOST_FOREACH(boost::property_tree::ptree::value_type &v,
    config.get_child("path.to.array_of_objects"))
{
    std::cout << "First data: " << v.first.data() << std::endl;
    boost::property_tree::ptree subtree = (boost::property_tree::ptree) v.second ;
    BOOST_FOREACH(boost::property_tree::ptree::value_type &vs,
        subtree)
    {
        std::cout << "Sub data: " << vs.first.data() << std::endl;
    }
}
 This compiles, does not throw any exeptions but does not cout any Sub data, it just skeeps thru this cycle. Update 2: Hm... something probably went wrong in my xml - now I get correct results with that code.
@CODE:const ptree &settings = pt.get_child("settings", empty_ptree<ptree>()); BOOST_FOREACH BOOST_FOREACH(const boost::property_tree::ptree &v,

@TITLE:Class with too many parameters: better design strategy?
@CONTENT:I am working with models of neurons. One class I am designing is a cell class which is a topological description of a neuron (several compartments connected together). It has many parameters but they are all relevant, for example: number of axon segments, apical bifibrications, somatic length, somatic diameter, apical length, branching randomness, branching length and so on and so on... there are about 15 parameters in total! I can set all these to some default value but my class looks crazy with several lines for parameters. This kind of thing must happen occasionally to other people too, is there some obvious better way to design this or am I doing the right thing? UPDATE: As some of you have asked I have attached my code for the class, as you can see this class has a huge number of parameters (>15) but they are all used and are necessary to define the topology of a cell. The problem essentially is that the physical object they create is very complex. I have attached an image representation of objects produced by this class.

@CONTENT:I used this How do you map an enum as an int value with fluent NHibernate? to map in the past but I've recently upgraded to NHibernate 3 and this doesn't seem to work anymore. I've put breakpoints in my EnumConvention class and they're not being hit. The query that is hitting the database has the enum as a string which is the default configuration. How does this work with NHibernate 3?

@CONTENT:Found a couple of similar questions here on this, but couldn't figure out how to apply to my scenario. My function has a parameter called @IncludeBelow. Values are 0 or 1 (BIT). I have this query: SELECT p.*
FROM Locations l
INNER JOIN Posts p
on l.LocationId = p.LocationId
WHERE l.Condition1 = @Value1
AND   l.SomeOtherCondition = @SomeOtherValue
 If @IncludeBelow is 0, i need the query to be this: SELECT p.*

INNER JOIN Posts p
on l.LocationId = p.LocationId
WHERE l.Condition1 = @Value1
AND   l.SomeOtherCondition = @SomeOtherValue
AND   p.LocationType = @LocationType -- additional filter to only include level.
 If @IncludeBelow is 1, that last line needs to be excluded. (i.e don't apply filter). I'm guessing it needs to be a CASE statement, but can't figure out the syntax. Here's what i've tried: SELECT p.*
FROM Locations l
INNER JOIN Posts p
on l.LocationId = p.LocationId
WHERE l.Condition1 = @Value1
AND   l.SomeOtherCondition = @SomeOtherValue

@CONTENT:An alternative title might be: Check for existence of multiple rows? Using a combination of SQL and C# I want a method to return true if all products in a list exist in a table. If it can be done all in SQL that would be preferable. I have written a method that returns whether a single productID exists using the following SQL: SELECT productID FROM Products WHERE ProductID = @productID
 If this returns a row, then the c# method returns true, false otherwise. Now I'm wondering if I have a list of product IDs (not a huge list mind you, normally under 20). How can I write a query that will return a row if all the product id's exist and no row if one or more product id's does not exist? (Maybe something involving "IN" like:
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID IN ('1', '10', '100', 'ABC'))
 EDIT: How the result is expressed is not important to me. Whether the query returns a 1 or 0, an empty resultset or a non-empty one, true or false doesn't matter. I'd prefer the answer that is 1) easy to read and understand and 2) performant I was envisioning concatenating the list of product id's with the SQL. Obviously this opens the code up to SQL injection (the product id's are actually varchar. in this case the chance is slim but still want to avoid that possibility). So if there is a way around this that would be better. Using SQL Server 2005. Product ID's are varchar
@CODE:productID SELECT productID FROM Products WHERE ProductID = @productID (Maybe something involving "IN" like:
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID IN ('1', '10', '100', 'ABC')) 1 0 varchar varchar if(result.hasrows()) return true else return false

Would MAMP or XAMPP modify the existing Apache and PHP installation? Any comments on how I should proceed?

@CONTENT:I'm maintaining a Java web application. Looking into the login code it gets an HttpSession out of HttpServletRequest via the getSession() method of HttpServletRequest. (It uses some values in the session for authentication purposes) However I'm worried about session fixation attacks so after I have used the initial session I want to either start a new session or change the session id. Is this possible?

@TITLE:How does Object.GetHashCode work when the GC moves an object?
@CONTENT:If I understand correctly, in .NET the default implementation of Object.GetHashCode() returns a value based on an object's memory address (at least for reference-types). However, the garbage collector is free to move objects around in memory. Presumably the hash code doesn't change just because the GC moves an object, so is there special handling for this interaction, or are my assumptions wrong?

@CONTENT:PostgreSQL supports a variety of geometric types out of the box, along with lots of geometric operators and GiST indexes which seem to offer spatial indexing of data. And then there's also PostGIS, which is an extension to PG. What is the difference between the built-in spatial support in PG and PostGIS? If my application needs to store geographical coordinates (points, areas, polygons) and then efficiently do queries (such as point-in-polygon, polygon intersection), do I need PostGIS or can I use the (arguably) more convenient and simpler built-in data types / syntax?

@TITLE:Ruby functions vs methods
@CONTENT:In the Ruby Programming Language, Chapter 6 (second paragraph) they state: Many languages distinguish between functions, which have no associated object, and methods, which are invoked on a receiver object. Because Ruby is a purely object oriented language, all methods are true methods and are associated with at least one object. And then in the middle of the 6th paragraph: Both procs and lambdas are functions rather than methods invoked on an object. I am a bit confused about these statements. Is Ruby truly pure OO, and therefore doesn't have functions that aren't associated with objects (if that is a valid definition of pure OO), or are procs/lambdas associated with the Proc object? What is the difference between functions and methods in Ruby? Any help in parsing and understanding this would be appreciated.

@TITLE:maximum number of parameters in sql query
@CONTENT:I do experiment with LINQ since some time. Typical method to enumerate through a collection and change some of its properties in my code would look like: ATDataContext dc = new ATDataContext(Settings.connection_string);

int[] col = ListViewClass.getListViewSelectedPositionTags(listView);

try
{
    foreach (var item in col)

        ctx.Excluded = 'Y';
        ctx.ExcludedComments = reason;
    }

    dc.SubmitChanges();
}
 Some time a have got an advice to do this by... seems like much smarter way: var ctx = from r in dc.MailingLists
    where col.Contains(r.ID)
    select r;

foreach (var item in ctx)
{
    item.Excluded = 'Y';
    item.ExcludedComments = reason;
}

dc.SubmitChanges();
 Iit makes sense on so many levels and I love this solution. It¡¦s smart and faster than the first one. I have used this solution in a production environment for some time. What was my surprise after few weeks when searching an application log files and see this: "The incoming tabular data stream (TDS) remote procedure call (RPC) protocol stream is incorrect. Too many parameters were provided in this RCP request. The maximum is 2100." The LINQ to SQL converts where col.Contains(r.ID) to INclause looking something like: WHERE ID IN (@p1, @p1, @p2 ¡K ) The col collection reached (in my case) more than 2100 elements and the query failed to perform. I have done some research on the problem and what I ended up is: ¡§¡K Maximum number of parameters in the sql query is 2100. There is more limitations, like the fact that the whole query string cannot be longer than 8044 characters.¡¨ I have loved the second solution so much. I am so disappointed with these hard-coded limitations of the SQL Server. Did I miss something? Is there anything I can do to be able to use the ¡§where col.Contains(r.ID)¡¨ version? Regards Mariusz ps. (I use Win XP, C# with LINQ and SQL 2005 Express).

@CONTENT:I ran across this and was wondering if someone could explain why this works in VB.NET when I would expect it should fail, just like it does in C# //The C# Version

struct Person {

Person someone = null; //Nope! Can't do that!!
Person? someoneElse = null; //No problem, just like expected
 But then in VB.NET... Structure Person
    Public name As String
End Structure
...
Dim someone As Person = Nothing 'Wha? this is okay?
 Is Nothing not the same as null (Nothing != null - LOL?), or is this just different ways of handling the same situation between the two languages? Why or what is handled differently between the two that makes this okay in one, but not the other? [Update] Given some of the comments, I messed with this a bit more... it seems as if you actually have to use Nullable if you want to allow something to be null in VB.NET... so for example... 'This is false - It is still a person'
Dim someone As Person = Nothing
Dim isSomeoneNull As Boolean = someone.Equals(Nothing) 'false'

'This is true - the result is actually nullable now'
Dim someoneElse As Nullable(Of Person) = Nothing
Dim isSomeoneElseNull As Boolean = someoneElse.Equals(Nothing) 'true'
 Too weird...

struct Person {

@TITLE:How do you manage the String Translation Process?
@CONTENT:I am working on a Software Project that needs to be translated into 30 languages. This means that changing any string incurs into a relatively high cost. Additionally, translation does not happen overnight, because the translation package needs to be worked by different translators, so this might take a while. Adding new features is cumbersome somehow. We can think up all the Strings that will be needed before we actually code the UI, but sometimes still we need to add new strings because of bug fixes or because of an oversight. So the question is, how do you manage all this process? Any tips in how to ease the impact of translation in the software project? How to rule the strings, instead of having the strings rule you?

@TITLE:Why does HttpCacheability.Private suppress ETags?
@CONTENT:While writing a custom IHttpHandler I came across a behavior that I didn't expect concerning the HttpCachePolicy object. My handler calculates and sets an entity-tag (using the SetETag method on the HttpCachePolicy associated with the current response object). If I set the cache-control to public using the SetCacheability method everything works like a charm and the server sends along the e-tag header. If I set it to private the e-tag header will be suppressed. Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough but I haven't seen anything in the HTTP/1.1 spec that would justify this behavior. Why wouldn't you want to send E-Tag to browsers while still prohibiting proxies from storing the data? using System;
using System.Web;

public class Handler : IHttpHandler {
    public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext ctx) {
        ctx.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private);
        ctx.Response.Cache.SetETag("\"static\"");
        ctx.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
        ctx.Response.Write("Hello World");
    }

    public bool IsReusable { get { return true; } }
}
 Will return 
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 11
 But if we change it to public it'll return 
Cache-Control: public
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 11
Etag: "static"
 I've run this on the ASP.NET development server and IIS6 so far with the same results. Also I'm unable to explicitly set the ETag using Response.AppendHeader("ETag", "static")
 Update: It's possible to append the ETag header manually when running in IIS7, I suspect this is caused by the tight integration between ASP.NET and the IIS7 pipeline. Clarification: It's a long question but the core question is this: why does ASP.NET do this, how can I get around it and should I? Update: I'm going to accept Tony's answer since it's essentially correct (go Tony!). I found that if you want to emulate the HttpCacheability.Private fully you can set the cacheability to ServerAndPrivate but you also have call cache.SetOmitVaryStar(true) otherwise the cache will add the Vary: * header to the output and you don't want that. I'll edit that into the answer when I get edit permissions (or if you see this Tony perhaps you could edit your answer to include that call?)

@TITLE:Generators and for loops in Python
@CONTENT:So I have a generator function, that looks like this. def generator():
    while True:
        for x in range(3):
            for j in range(5):
                yield x
 After I load up this function and call "next" a bunch of times, I'd expect it to yield values 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 ... But instead it just yields 0 all the time. Why is that? >>> execfile("test.py")
>>> generator
<function generator at 0x10b6121b8>
>>> generator().next()
0
>>> generator().next()
0
>>> generator().next()
0
>>> generator().next()
0
>>> generator().next()
0
>>> generator().next()
0
>>> generator().next()
0

@TITLE:How can I make Windows 8.1 aware that my Delphi application wants to support Per Monitor DPI?
@CONTENT:I have tried to make Windows 8.1 recognize a Delphi XE6 application (a demo program) that I have been trying to build, and have it recognize my application is Per-Monitor DPI aware, purely by the Manifest technique. Delphi XE6 (and all other similarly up to date versions of Delphi) make adding a manifest easy to do, inside Project Options, and I have done so. This is the .manifest content I have determined using MSDN resources. I suspect it could be slightly incorrect. If you want to try this manifest, make an empty VCL application, use this content as your manifest, and add the code (code is currently attached to my answer to this question). <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

 Has anyone gotten this to work? What I find is that the above is not recognized. If I call SetProcessDPIAwareness(Process_Per_Monitor_DPI_Aware) first, then call GetProcessDPIAwareness(hProc,Awareness), I get back the necessary Awareness = Process_Per_Monitor_DPI_Aware, but I have read that there are potential drawbacks to that approach, and so I would prefer a working Manifest-only approach. If I call GetProcessDPIAwareness(hProc,Awareness), I get back `Awareness = Process_DPI_Unaware'. My other worry is that in the MSDN sources they specify adding an ADDITIONAL manifest. Whereas, I am using Delphi XE6's IDE's ability to link ONE and ONLY ONE manifest into my application. I have never noticed that adding any additional manifest versus having only one was ever a problem, other than that perhaps the .manifest management system in Visual Studio 2010 was lame, and that is why the tip existed, and so has no relevance to other IDEs/Languages. In Visual Studio 2013, there is a checkbox right inside the project options, but I don't have Visual Studio 2013 so I can't examine a working .manifest. update: Here's another shot at a manifest: <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0" xmlns:asmv3="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3" >
  <asmv3:application>
    <asmv3:windowsSettings xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">
      <dpiAware>true</dpiAware>
    </asmv3:windowsSettings>
  </asmv3:application>
</assembly>
 The above mini manifest changes the behavior of the application, but not exactly the way I wanted it to. With the above tiny manifest, the OLD Windows 8.0/Windows 7/Vista DPI awareness level is detected. update 2: Thanks Remy for the ideas. Interestingly the following appears to be valid enough to allow an application launch. However mixing the SMI/2005 syntax with the above caused a side-by-side launch error. You can see that Microsoft has been churning on their manifests rather a lot. Note that the following does not actually solve my problem, but it provides yet another "potential base form" that might be CLOSE to the real solution:  <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3" manifestVersion="1.0" >
  <application>
    <windowsSettings xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2011/WindowsSettings">
      <dpiAware>true</dpiAware>
    </windowsSettings>
  </application>
</assembly>
 update 3: CODE RED ALERT! DO NOT USE the following OS COMPATIBILITY flag in any Delphi VCL application: <supportedOS Id="{1f676c76-80e1-4239-95bb-83d0f6d0da78}"/>. Microsoft has BROKEN MOUSE CAPTURE BEHAVIOUR, BROKEN WINDOW PAINTING in horrible ways that I have not even been able to guess at. Turning this flag on caused very subtle bugs in my application, including painting problems, inability to click on controls (mouse down messages not reaching controls, due to mouse capture being lost), and many other problems.

@LINK:/questions/20059532/are-all-functions-in-c-c-assumed-to-return
@TITLE:Are all functions in C/C++ assumed to return?
@CONTENT:I was reading this paper on undefined behaviour and one of the example "optimisations" looks highly dubious: if (arg2 == 0)
    ereport(ERROR, (errcode(ERRCODE_DIVISION_BY_ZERO),
                    errmsg("division by zero")));
/* No overflow is possible */
PG_RETURN_INT32((int32) arg1 / arg2);
 Figure 2: An unexpected optimization voids the division-by-zero check, in src/backend/utils/adt/int8.c of PostgreSQL. The call to ereport(ERROR, :::) will raise an exception. Essentially, the compiler assumes that ereport will return, and removes the arg2 == 0 check since the presence of the division implies a non-zero denominator, i.e. arg2 != 0. Is this a valid optimisation? Is the compiler free to assume that a function will always return? EDIT: The whole thing depends on ereport, which is described thus:    84 /*----------
   85  * New-style error reporting API: to be used in this way:
   86  *      ereport(ERROR,

   88  *               errmsg("portal \"%s\" not found", stmt->portalname),
   89  *               ... other errxxx() fields as needed ...));
   90  *
   91  * The error level is required, and so is a primary error message (errmsg

   94  * if elevel is WARNING, or ERRCODE_SUCCESSFUL_COMPLETION if elevel is
   95  * NOTICE or below.
   96  *
   97  * ereport_domain() allows a message domain to be specified, for modules that
   98  * wish to use a different message catalog from the backend's.  To avoid having
   99  * one copy of the default text domain per .o file, we define it as NULL here
  100  * and have errstart insert the default text domain.  Modules can either use
  101  * ereport_domain() directly, or preferably they can override the TEXTDOMAIN
  102  * macro.
  103  *
  104  * If elevel >= ERROR, the call will not return; we try to inform the compiler

@TITLE:CMake output/build directory
@CONTENT:I'm pretty new to cmake, and read a few tutorials on how to use it, and wrote some complicated 50 lines CMake script in order to make a program for 3 different compilers. This probably concludes all my knowledge in cmake. Now my problem is that I have some source code, whose folder I don't want to touch/mess when I make the program. I want that all cmake and make output files and folders to go into ../Compile/, so I changed a few variables in my cmake script for that, and it worked for sometime when I did something like this on my laptop: Compile$ cmake ../src
Compile$ make
 Where with that I had a clean output in the folder I'm in right now, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Now I moved to another computer, and recompiled CMake 2.8.11.2, and I'm almost back to square one! It always compiles the thing into the src folder where my CMakeLists.txt is located. The part where I choose the directory in my cmake script is this: set(dir ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../Compile/)

@CONTENT:After rooting my device, I need to run adb root and then adb shell so I could then access my applications database. When trying to run adb root I keep getting "adbd cannot run as root in production builds". Why is this? The only other option is to use the Android emulator for testing, but we all know how terrible the emulator is (not really a viable development solution).

@LINK:/questions/16946207/does-foreach-cause-repeated-linq-execution
@TITLE:Does ¡§foreach¡¨ cause repeated Linq execution?
@CONTENT:I've been working for the first time with the Entity Framework in .NET, and have been writing LINQ queries in order to get information from my model. I would like to program in good habits from the beginning, so I've been doing research on the best way to write these queries, and get their results. Unfortunately, in browsing Stack Exchange, I've seem to have come across two conflicting explanations in how deferred/immediate execution works with LINQ: A foreach causes the query to be executed in each iteration of the loop: Demonstrated in question Slow foreach() on a LINQ query - ToList() boosts performance immensely - why is this? , the implication is that "ToList()" needs to be called in order to evaluate the query immediately, as the foreach is evaluating the query on the data source repeatedly, slowing down the operation considerably. Another example is the question Foreaching through grouped linq results is incredibly slow, any tips? , where the accepted answer also implies that calling "ToList()" on the query will improve performance. A foreach causes a query to be executed once, and is safe to use with LINQ Demonstrated in question Does foreach execute the query only once? , the implication is that the foreach causes one enumeration to be established, and will not query the datasource each time. Continued browsing of the site has turned up many questions where "repeated execution during a foreach loop" is the culprit of the performance concern, and plenty of other answers stating that a foreach will appropriately grab a single query from a datasource, which means that both explanations seem to have validity. If the "ToList()" hypothesis is incorrect (as most of the current answers as of 2013-06-05 1:51 PM EST seem to imply), where does this misconception come from? Is there one of these explanations that is accurate and one that isn't, or are there different circumstances that could cause a LINQ query to evaluate differently? Edit: In addition to the accepted answer below, I've turned up the following question over on Programmers that very much helped my understanding of query execution, particularly the the pitfalls that could result in multiple datasource hits during a loop, which I think will be helpful for others interested in this question: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/178218/for-vs-foreach-vs-linq

@LINK:/questions/15664670/delete-one-specific-fragment-from-the-android-backstack
@TITLE:Delete one specific fragment from the Android backstack
@CONTENT:For a android tablet application I use 2 fragments. One on the left side on the screen and one on the right side. When you click on a button at the right fragment, another fragment wil be added on the top of the right fragment. This fragment is added to the backstack. FragmentTransaction ft = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction(); 
ft.add(R.id.fragmentlayout, fragment2);
ft.addToBackStack("Fragment2");
ft.commit();
 The backstack is now: [fragment 1] -> [fragment 2] On the left side is also a button that opens a fragment on top of the left fragment (same as fragment2) and adds it to the backstack. The backstack is now [fragment 1] -> [fragment 2] -> [fragment 3] On fragment 2 is a button to close that fragment. getFragmentManager().popBackStack("Fragment2", FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE);
 The problem is when I only want to close [fragment 2], [fragment 3] will also be destroyed. I can remove the fragment manualy by calling FragmentTransaction ft = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
ft.remove(fragment2).commit();
 But the backstack will remain [fragment 1] -> [(ghost) fragment 2] -> [fragment 3] So you need to press back one time more to close the application. Is there a way to only remove [fragment 2] from the backstack and leave [fragment 3] on the screen?
@CODE:FragmentTransaction ft = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction(); 
ft.add(R.id.fragmentlayout, fragment2);
ft.addToBackStack("Fragment2");
ft.commit(); getFragmentManager().popBackStack("Fragment2", FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE); FragmentTransaction ft = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
ft.remove(fragment2).commit();

 The projects folder is around 30G which is nearly impossible to use git-svn clone to checkout all the modules, but it's because it counts all the branches and tags. Is it possible to just clone the project only trunk so I can start committing locally?

@TITLE:Two different seeds producing the same 'random' sequence
@CONTENT:Maybe there is a very logic explanation for this, but I just can't seem to understand why the seeds 0 and 2,147,483,647 produce the same "random" sequence, using .NET's Random Class (System). Quick code example: ushort len = 8;
Random r0 = new Random(0), r1 = new Random(1), r2 = new Random(int.MaxValue); //2,147,483,647
byte[] b0 = new byte[len], b1 = new byte[len], b2 = new byte[len];

r0.NextBytes(b0);
r1.NextBytes(b1);
r2.NextBytes(b2);

for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
{
  System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("{0}\t\t{1}\t\t{2}", b0[i], b1[i], b2[i]);
}

Console.ReadLine();
 Output: 26      70      26
12      208     12
70      134     76

216     163     216
 As you can see, the first and the third sequence are the same. Can someone please explain this to me? EDIT: Apparently, as alro pointed out, these sequences are not the same. But they are very similar.
@CODE:0 2,147,483,647 ushort len = 8;

@TITLE:Nested DbContext due to method calls - Entity Framework
@CONTENT:In the following case where two DbContexts are nested due to method calls: public void Method_A() {
    using (var db = new SomeDbContext()) {
        //...do some work here
        Method_B();

    }
}

public void Method_B() {

}
 Question: Will this nesting cause any issues? (and will the correct DbContext be disposed at the correct time?) Is this nesting considered bad practice, should Method_A be refactored into: public void Method_A() {
    using (var db = new SomeDbContext()) {
        //...do some work here
    }

    Method_B();

    using (var db = new SomeDbContext()) {

@TITLE:Window style with WPF Ribbon from Microsoft doesn't match Windows 8 style
@CONTENT:I'm using the release Version of Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2012 to create a WPF application with a Ribbon control. I choose the ribbon control that comes with WPF in .Net Framework 4.5. My code to create the ribbon: <RibbonWindow
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfExperiments" x:Class="WpfExperiments.MainWindow"

<Ribbon>        
    <Ribbon.ApplicationMenu>
        <RibbonApplicationMenu>
            <RibbonApplicationMenuItem Header="Item 1"></RibbonApplicationMenuItem>

            <RibbonButton SmallImageSource="Test.ico" Label="Test"></RibbonButton>
        </RibbonQuickAccessToolBar>
    </Ribbon.QuickAccessToolBar>
</Ribbon>
 But the problem is that it generates a window with a ugly style that doesn't match the windows 8 style: Compare it to the explorer ribbon. The window title is centered (and has a different color) and the border size of the window is different. The style of the ribbon isn't the same, but I would be satisfied if I had the same ribbon style as MS Word (wich is displayed correctly in Windows 8). Does the ribbon control for WPF not support the new Windows 8 style? Or did I miss any setting? Edit: I started to edit the template in Blend (4.0, i don't have access to 5.0). After fixing some compilation errors (seems to be bugs in blend), I can run the application, but it looks like this: But that isn't a good starting point for my changes...

@TITLE:Use system PIN dialog in Android application
@CONTENT:Background I am trying to write an application which works like described below. When user start application it check if user have registered PIN on his device. If user have registered PIN, application must show button "Continue with PIN". When user press on button "Continue with PIN" system standard PIN dialog must appears. User enter his PIN and press "Continue" button. After System must check if entered PIN is correct or no and continue working. Searches I have made some searches and found some articles on stackoverflow and other internet sources which say "There is no way to develop a new custom unlock mechanism on a non-rooted phone." or "I would be surprised if you could, because then you would be probably able to steal the pin code, and I don't think anyone would want that.". Also I have watched some video tutorials like Tutorial: Android Internals - Building a Custom ROM, Pt. 1 of 2 and Tutorial: Android Internals - Building a Custom ROM, Pt. 2 of 2. EDITED I have made some searches today and found a very interesting thing, I think I am on a right way to the solution, and I want to share my ideas with you. So looking in android sources I found an interesting files ChooseLockPassword.java (packages\apps\Settings\src\com\android\settings) and LockPatternUtils.java (*frameworks\base\core\java\com\android\internal\widget*) now I am interest in: Question How can I call LockPatternUtils class function from my code ? Or Why I cant see that function in Eclipse ? Decision So I think that the only way to get access to the Android system PIN dialog is to root the phone make some changes in the system files and use system PIN dialod Question Can somebody provide me useful links about getting access to the system PIN dialog in the rooted phone. Am I on a right way and can I solve my problem in this way? If anybody encountered such problem please help me to solve. Any Solutions?

@TITLE:Insert current date/time using now() in a field using MySQL/PHP
@CONTENT:Since MySQL evidently cannot automatically insert the function now() in a datetime field in adding new records like some other databases, based on comments, I'm explicitly trying to insert it using an SQL statement. (People seem to think timestamp with curdate() is not the answer due to the various limitations of timestamp.) There are numerous articles on the web suggesting inserting now() using SQL should work. When I try to insert the date time using the SQL statement, however, the field does not populate with the current time/date, but it only gives me the default 0000-00-, etc. This is probably a syntax error, but it's driving me crazy, so I am posting it. mysql_query("INSERT INTO users (first, last, whenadded) VALUES ('$first', '$last', now())"; 
 It inserts first and last, but nothing for when added, leaving 0000-00-00, etc. in the whenadded field. The field type is datetime, it has no collation, attributes, null default or extra. BTW, I tried putting now() in single quotes... It threw an error.

@TITLE:iOS frame change one property (eg width)
@CONTENT:This question was originally asked for the objective-c programming language. At the time of writing, swift didn't even exist yet. Question Is it possible to change only one property of a CGRect ? For example: self.frame.size.width = 50;
 instead of self.frame = CGRectMake(self.frame.origin.x, 
                        self.frame.origin.y, 
                        self.frame.size.width, 
                        50);
 of course I understand that self.frame.size.width is read only so I'm wondering how to do this? CSS ANALOGY proceed at your own risk for those of you who are familiar with CSS, the idea is very similar to using: margin-left: 2px;
 instead of having to change the whole value: margin: 5px 5px 5px 2px;
@CODE:CGRect self.frame.size.width = 50; self.frame = CGRectMake(self.frame.origin.x, 
                        self.frame.origin.y,

I have reached a stumbling block with the following code:     private static DataTable QueryImpl(ref IDbConnection conn, String SqlToExecute, CommandType CommandType, Array Parameters)
    {
        SetupConnection(ref conn);

        return dt;
    }
 When this code is executed, I receive an InvalidCastException which states the following: The SqlParameterCollection only accepts non-null SqlParameter type objects, not String objects. The code falls over on the line: cmd.Parameters.Add(Parameters.GetValue(i));
 Any ideas? Any improvements to the above code is appreciated. Actual solution:     private static readonly Regex regParameters = new Regex(@"@\w+", RegexOptions.Compiled);

@TITLE:OData ¡§where ID in list¡¨ query
@CONTENT:I have an OData service where I'm trying to filter by a list of IDs; the SQL equivalent would be something like: SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE TableId IN (100, 200, 300, 400)
 The property I'm trying to filter on is typed as an Int32. I've tried the following, which gives me an error "Operator 'add' incompatible with operand types 'Edm.String' and 'Edm.Int32'": string ids = ",100,200,300,400,";
from m in provider.Media where ids.Contains("," + t.media_id + ",")
 as well as string ids = ",100,200,300,400,";

 and string ids = ",100,200,300,400,";
from m in provider.Media where ids.Contains(string.Concat(",", t.media_id, ","))
 As you can see, currently I'm using LINQ to query the service. Is there a way I can do what I'm trying to, or am I stuck constructing a text filter and using AddQueryOption, and iterating through the list and manually adding "or media_id eq 100" clauses?

@LINK:/questions/7313919/c11-alternative-to-localtime-r
@TITLE:C++11 alternative to localtime_r
@CONTENT:C++ defines time formatting functions in terms of strftime, which requires a struct tm "broken-down time" record. However, the C and C++03 languages provide no thread-safe way to obtain such a record; there is just one master struct tm for the whole program. In C++03, this was more or less OK, because the language didn't support multithreading; it merely supported platforms supporting multithreading, which then provided facilities like POSIX localtime_r. C++11 also defines new time utilities, which interface with the non-broken-down time_t type, which is what would be used to reinitialize the global struct tm. But obtaining a time_t isn't the problem. Am I missing something or does this task still require reliance on POSIX? EDIT: Here is some workaround code. It maintains compatibility with multithreaded environments that provide ::localtime_r and single-threaded environments that provide only std::localtime. It can easily be adapted to check for other functions as well, such as posix::localtime_r or ::localtime_s or what-have-you. namespace query {
    char localtime_r( ... );

    struct has_localtime_r
        { enum { value = sizeof localtime_r( std::declval< std::time_t * >(), std::declval< std::tm * >() )
                        == sizeof( std::tm * ) }; };

@TITLE:Efficiency of crossover in genetic algorithms
@CONTENT:I've implemented a number of genetic algorithms to solve a variety of a problems. However I'm still skeptical of the usefulness of crossover/recombination. I usually first implement mutation before implementing crossover. And after I implement crossover, I don't typically see a significant speed-up in the rate at which a good candidate solution is generated compared to simply using mutation and introducing a few random individuals in each generation to ensure genetic . Of course, this may be attributed to poor choices of the crossover function and/or the probabilities, but I'd like to get some concrete explanation/evidence as to why/whether or not crossover improves GAs. Have there been any studies regarding this? I understand the reasoning behind it: crossover allows the strengths of two individuals to be combined into one individual. But to me that's like saying we can mate a scientist and a jaguar to get a smart and fast hybrid. EDIT: In mcdowella's answer, he mentioned how finding a case where cross-over can improve upon hill-climbing from multiple start points is non-trivial. Could someone elaborate upon this point?

 Or more general: How do I compare two types so that compare(double1,double2) will evalute true and compare(int,double) will evaluate false. Also I'd like to compare structs of different composition as well. Thanks for any help. Edit: Basically I have a function that operates on variables of type "struct a" and "struct b". I want to do one thing with the "struct a" variables and the other with the "struct b" variables. Since C doesn't support overloading and the void pointer losses its type information I need to check for type. Btw. what would be the sence in having a typeof operator, if you can't compare types? Edit2: The sizeof-method seems to be a practical workaround solution for me. Thanks for your help. I still find it a bit strange since the types are know at compiletime but if I imagine the processes in the machine I can see, why the information is not stored in terms of types but rather in terms of byte size. Size is the only thing really relevant besides addresses.

@CONTENT:(Assume use strict; use warnings; throughout this question.) I am exploring the usage of sub. sub bb { print @_; }
bb 'a';
 This works as expected. The parenthesis is optional, like with many other functions, like print, open etc. However, this causes a compilation error: bb 'a';
sub bb { print @_; }

String found where operator expected at t13.pl line 4, near "bb 'a'"
        (Do you need to predeclare bb?)
syntax error at t13.pl line 4, near "bb 'a'"
Execution of t13.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
 But this does not: bb('a');
sub bb { print @_; }
 Similarly, a sub without args, such as: special_print;
my special_print { print $some_stuff }
 Will cause this error: Bareword "special_print" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at t13.pl line 6.
Execution of t13.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
 Ways to alleviate this particular error is: Put & before the sub name, e.g. &special_print Put empty parenthesis after sub name, e.g. special_print() Predeclare special_print with sub special_print at the top of the script. Call special_print after the sub declaration. My question is, why this special treatment? If I can use a sub globally within the script, why can't I use it any way I want it? Is there a logic to sub being implemented this way? ETA: I know how I can fix it. I want to know the logic behind this.

@TITLE:Using Tasks with conditional continuations
@CONTENT:I'm a little confused about how to use Tasks with conditional Continuations. If I have a task, and then I want to continue with a tasks that handle success and error, and then wait on those to complete. void FunctionThrows() {throw new Exception("faulted");}

static void MyTest()
{

    var taskThrows = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => FunctionThrows());

    var onSuccess = taskThrows.ContinueWith(
                          prev => Console.WriteLine("success"), 
                          TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompleted);

    var onError = taskThrows.ContinueWith(
                          prev => Console.WriteLine(prev.Exception),
                          TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);

    //so far, so good



    //this throws because onSuccess was cancelled before it was started
    Task.WaitAll(onSuccess, onError);
}
 Is this the preferred way of doing task success/failure branching? Also, how am I supposed to join all these tasks, suppose I've created a long line of continuations, each having their own error handling.   //for example
  var task1 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => ...)
  var task1Error = task1.ContinueWith(  //on faulted
  var task2  = task1.ContinueWith(      //on success
  var task2Error = task2.ContinueWith(  //on faulted
  var task3 = task2.ContinueWith(       //on success
  //etc
 Calling WaitAll on these invariably throws, because some of the continuations will be cancelled due to the TaskContinuationOptions, and calling Wait on a cancelled task throws. How do I join these without getting the "A task was cancelled" exception"?
@CODE:void FunctionThrows() {throw new Exception("faulted");}

Example: I've changed "Versioning System" to "Apple Generic" at the target level. Afterwards I realised I should set it at the project level, and so I want to delete the target level setting. However, there's no way I can see to remove the setting -- you click on it and there's two options, neither of which is the default "not specified" empty setting. Hitting the delete key on the keyboard nothing. The same goes for fields that accept text -- if I try to delete a setting by just deleting all the text set, it still shows that field in green, but with no text in it, and regards it as the presence of a setting.

After some extensive investigation I've discovered the following: ifconfig makes use of SIOCGIFADDR, which requires open sockets and advance knowledge of all the interface names. It also isn't documented in any manual pages on Linux. proc contains /proc/net/dev, but this is a list of interface statistics. proc contains /proc/net/if_inet6, which is exactly what I need but for IPv6. Generally interfaces are easy to find in proc, but actual addresses are very rarely used except where explicitly part of some connection. There's a system call called getifaddrs, which is very much a "magical" function you'd expect to see in Windows. It's also implemented on BSD. However it's not very text-oriented, which makes it difficult to use from non-C languages.

@LINK:/questions/4881443/clojures-let-equivalent-in-scala
@TITLE:Clojure's 'let' equivalent in Scala
@CONTENT:Often I face following situation: suppose I have these three functions def firstFn: Int = ...
def secondFn(b: Int): Long = ...
def thirdFn(x: Int, y: Long, z: Long): Long = ...
 and I also have calculate function. My first approach can look like this: def calculate(a: Long) = thirdFn(firstFn, secondFn(firstFn), secondFn(firstFn) + a)
 It looks beautiful and without any curly brackets - just one expression. But it's not optimal, so I end up with this code: def calculate(a: Long) = {
  val first = firstFn
  val second = secondFn(first)

  thirdFn(first, second, second + a)
}
 Now it's several expressions surrounded with curly brackets. At such moments I envy Clojure a little bit. With let function I can define this function in one expression. So my goal here is to define calculate function with one expression. I come up with 2 solutions. 1 - With scalaz I can define it like this (are there better ways to do this with scalaz?):   def calculate(a: Long) = 
    firstFn |> {first => secondFn(first) |> {second => thirdFn(first, second, second + a)}}
 What I don't like about this solution is that it's nested. The more vals I have the deeper this nesting is. 2 - With for comprehension I can achieve something similar:   def calculate(a: Long) = 
    for (first <- Option(firstFn); second <- Option(secondFn(first))) yield thirdFn(first, second, second + a)
 From one hand this solution has flat structure, just like let in Clojure, but from the other hand I need to wrap functions' results in Option and receive Option as result from calculate (it's good it I'm dealing with nulls, but I don't... and don't want to). Are there better ways to achieve my goal? What is the idiomatic way for dealing with such situations (may be I should stay with vals... but let way of doing it looks so elegant)? From other hand it's connected to Referential transparency. All three functions are referentially transparent (in my example firstFn calculates some constant like Pi), so theoretically they can be replaced with calculation results. I know this, but compiler does not, so it can't optimize my first attempt. And here is my second question: Can I somehow (may be with annotation) give hint to compiler, that my function is referentially transparent, so that it can optimize this function for me (put some kind of caching there, for example)? Edit Thanks everybody for the great answers! It's just impossible to select one best answer (may be because they all so good) so I will accept answer with the most up-votes, I think it's fair enough.
@CODE:def firstFn: Int = ...
def secondFn(b: Int): Long = ...
def thirdFn(x: Int, y: Long, z: Long): Long = ... calculate def calculate(a: Long) = thirdFn(firstFn, secondFn(firstFn), secondFn(firstFn) + a) def calculate(a: Long) = {
  val first = firstFn
  val second = secondFn(first)

  thirdFn(first, second, second + a)
} calculate def calculate(a: Long) = 
    firstFn |> {first => secondFn(first) |> {second => thirdFn(first, second, second + a)}} val for def calculate(a: Long) =

@TITLE:Slicing a dictionary by keys that start with a certain string
@CONTENT:This is pretty simple but I'd love a pretty, pythonic way of doing it. Basically, given a dictionary, return the subdictionary that contains only those keys that start with a certain string. ? d = {'Apple': 1, 'Banana': 9, 'Carrot': 6, 'Baboon': 3, 'Duck': 8, 'Baby': 2}
? print slice(d, 'Ba')
{'Banana': 9, 'Baby': 2, 'Baboon': 3}
 This is fairly simple to do with a function: def slice(sourcedict, string):
    newdict = {}
    for key in sourcedict.keys():
        if key.startswith(string):
            newdict[key] = sourcedict[key]
    return newdict
 But surely there is a nicer, cleverer, more readable solution? Could a generator help here? (I never have enough opportunities to use those).

 Just curious why I got such results. I considered CPython to be faster in most cases then MRI and even the new Ruby 1.9 on YARV but this "microbenchmark" did really surprised me. Btw, I know I can use specialised library function like fractions.gcd but I'd like to compare implementations of such basic and trivial language constructs. Did I miss something or is the implementation of the next Ruby generation so much improved in area of sheer speed ?

Obviously, it can't use the calling thread's transaction, so what does it do? Same question, but regarding methods that are triggered by the TimerService. EDIT: I think I phrased that poorly. I already know that the default mode is 'REQUIRED'. So it should be safe to assume that those methods will always be called within a transaction. But my question is, what does that transaction's life-cycle look like? Does the container create a new transaction for each call? Or does it re-use the same transaction for all the calls on an asynchronous worker thread? If it's the latter, then when does the transaction get closed?

 I have custom function, not part of Underscore.js called double(): function double(value) { return value * 2; };
 I would like to be able to call this function in an Underscore chain, as if it was part of Underscore. I would like to write the following, which I'd like to return 84: _([42, 43]).chain()
    .first()
    .double()
    .value()
 This can't work since Underscore doesn't define double(). I could use tap() as in: _([42, 43]).chain()
    .first()
    .tap(double)
    .value()
 This is valid, but tap applies the function to its argument and returns the argument, not the result of the function. So it looks to me like I would need a sort of tap that returns the result of the function applied to its argument. Is there anything like this in Underscore.js? Am I missing something terribly obvious?

But I don't know if it is applicable to my website because he used a test page with 20000 classes and 60000 DOM elements. Should I even care,does performance really get downgraded that much based upon the css strategy you take? Fo example, I like doing this ... .navbar { background:gray; }
.navbar > li { display:inline;background:#ffffff; }

<ul class="navbar">
  <li>Menu 1</li>
  <li>Menu 2</li>
  <li>Menu 3</li>

.navbar-item { display:inline;background:#ffffff; }
<ul class="navbar">
  <li class="navbar-item">Menu 1</li>
  <li class="navbar-item">Menu 2</li>
  <li class="navbar-item">Menu 3</li>
</ul>
 Some would say (and might be right) that the second option would be faster. But if you multiply the second method across all pages I see the following disadvantages: The page size will increase because all the elements having classes Number of css classes can get quite large which would require more css class parsing My pages seem to be ~ 8KB with ~1000 DOM elements. So my real question is how do I create a test bed where I could test performance deltas based on strategy taken for realistic web page sizes? Specifically how do i know how long it takes for a page to be displayed? javascript? how exactly? Help and just plain opinions are welcome!
@CODE:.navbar { background:gray; }
.navbar > li { display:inline;background:#ffffff; }

 So, the asterisk is part of the variable type; without it, that would mean something else (that's why I usually don't separate the asterisk from the variable type).

@TITLE:ExpectedException on TestMethod Visual Studio 2010
@CONTENT:Today I upgraded my solution with all the underlying projects from VS2008 to VS2010. Everything went well except for my unit tests. First of all only the web projects had as target framework .NET 4. All the other projects still had .NET 3.5. I changed them all to .NET 4. Now when I debug my unit tests it breaks on every exception. In 2008 it just wouldn't pass and tell me that an exception occurred. Even when I have the ExpectedException attribute defined it stops debugging on every exception. And example of one of my tests: [TestMethod]
[ExpectedException(typeof(EntityDoesNotExistException))]
public void ConstructorTest()
{
    AddressType type = new AddressType(int.MaxValue);
}
 The EntityDoesNotExistException is a custom exception and inherits Exception. Edit I looked at the Exceptions settings (ctrl+alt+e) in 2008 and 2010. In both versions the settings are the same. However in 2008 the debug doesn't break when I have the ExpectedException attribute. In 2010 it does break.

@TITLE:JQuery dialog momentairly displayed on page load
@CONTENT:I created a page that has a JQuery based dialog using the standard JQuery UI function. I do this with out of the box functionality of JQuery... nothing special at all. Here is my HTML for the dialog: <div id = "myDialog">
    <!-- ... more html in here for the dialog -->
</div>
 Then the JQuery called in javascript that transforms the <div> to a dialog:     // pruned .js as an example of kicking up a JQuery dialog
    $('#myDialog').dialog({
        autoOpen: false,
        title: 'Title here',
        modal: true
        }
    });
 Again, plain-vanilla JQuery. So you start this wizard by clicking on a link on the parent page, and it then spawns a JQuery dialog which has a significant chunk of HTML that includes images, etc. As I continued developing this page, I started to notice that when I loaded the page in the browser that the <div> tags I was putting in that JQuery transforms into dialogs would very briefly be displayed. Then the page would act as expected. In other words, the dialog would not be hidden, it would be displayed briefly in-line in the page. Quite ugly and unprofessional looking! But after a split second, the page would render correctly and look just as I expected/wanted. Over time, as the page size grew, the time the page would remain incorrectly rendered grew. My guess is that the rendering engine of the browser is rendering the page as it is loading, then at the end it is kicking off the JQuery that will transform the <div> into a dialog. This JQuery function will then transform the simple <div> to a JQuery dialog and hide it (since I have the autoOpen property set to false). Some browsers <cough>IE</cough> display it longer than others. My large-ish dialog now causes the page to incorrectly render for about 1 second... YUCK!
@CODE:<div id = "myDialog">
    <!-- ... more html in here for the dialog -->

@CONTENT:Background: I am aware of this SO question about Transactional NTFS (TxF) and this article describing how to use it, but I am looking for real-world experience with a reasonably high-volume enterprise system where lots of blob data (say documents and/or photos) need to be persisted once transactionally and read many times. We are expecting a few tens of thousands of documents written per day and reads of several tens of thousands per hour. We could either store indexes within the file system or in SQL Server but must be able to scale this out over several boxes. We must retain the ability to back up and restore the data easily for disaster recovery. The Question: Any real-world, enterprise-grade experience with Transactional NTFS (TxF)? Related questions: Anyone tried distributed transactions using TxF where the same file is committed to two mirror servers at once? Anyone tried a distributed transaction with the file system and a database? Any performance concerns/reliability concerns/performance data you can share? Has anyone even done something on this scale before where transactions are a concern? Edits: To be more clear, I have researched other technologies, including SQL Server 2008's new FILESTREAM data type, but this question is specificially targeted at the transactional file system only. More Resources: An MSDN Magazine article on TxF called "Enhance Your Apps With File System Transactions". A webcast called "Transactional Vista: Kernel Transaction Manager and friends (TxF, TxR)". This video quotes an overhead from using TxF of 2-5%, with the performance discussion starting about 25 minutes in. This is first set of hard numbers I've found. And the video is a very good overview of how this works under the hood. At about 34:30, the speaker describes a very similar scenario to this question. A Channel 9 screencast called "Surendra Verma: Vista Transactional File System". He talks about performance starting around 35 minutes in. No hard numbers. A list of TxF articles on the B# .NET Blog.

@CONTENT:I am creating a small game, the game is printed onto a panel on a windows form. Now i want to capture the keydown event to see if its the arrow keys that has been pressed, the problem however is that i can't seem to capture it. Let me explain, on the form i have 4 buttons and various other controls and if the user for instance press one of the buttons (to trigger a game event) then the button has focus and i can't capture the movements with the arrow keys. I tried something like private void KeyDown(KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Left)
        {
            game.MovePlayer(DonutWarsLibrary.GameObjects.Direction.E);

        }
        else if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Right)
        {
            game.MovePlayer(DonutWarsLibrary.GameObjects.Direction.W);
            game.DrawObjects(panel1.CreateGraphics());
        }
        else if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Up)
        {
            game.MovePlayer(DonutWarsLibrary.GameObjects.Direction.N);
            game.DrawObjects(panel1.CreateGraphics());
        }
        else if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Down)

            game.DrawObjects(panel1.CreateGraphics());
        }
    }
 and then when the form key down event was pressed, i used this private void MainForm_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        KeyDown(e);
    }
 I also added keydown for the buttons and the various other controls on the windows form, but i am not getting any response back. I have setup a breakpoint inside the function to see if it's being called, but that breakpoint never triggers? Any ideas? The most optimal was to have a general KeyDown event that triggers (regardless of what control that currently has focus) and then calls the KeyDown method.
@CODE:private void KeyDown(KeyEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Left)
        {
            game.MovePlayer(DonutWarsLibrary.GameObjects.Direction.E);
            game.DrawObjects(panel1.CreateGraphics());

It looks to me like the error is in the Random constructor: .method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname 
        instance void  .ctor() cil managed
{
  // Code size       12 (0xc)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  call       int32 System.Environment::get_TickCount()
  IL_0006:  call       instance void System.Random::.ctor(int32)
  IL_000b:  ret
} // end of method Random::.ctor
 As the documentation for the System.Environment.TickCount property says: The value of this property is derived from the system timer and is stored as a 32-bit signed integer. Consequently, if the system runs continuously, TickCount will increment from zero to Int32..::.MaxValue for approximately 24.9 days, then jump to Int32..::.MinValue, which is a negative number, then increment back to zero during the next 24.9 days. So, if you call the Random constructor during that one-millisecond period (after the system has been up for int.MaxValue milliseconds), it's going to throw this exception. Does anybody have a workaround? For my own code, I can make a CreateRandom method that gets the TickCount value and checks it for int.MinValue. But what to do about code that I have no control over? I hope the RTL team fixes this in .NET 4.0. Update 2009/07/22: The BCL Team responded to the bug and said that it has been resolved for the next release.

@TITLE:ASP.NET CheckBoxList DataBinding Question
@CONTENT:Is it possible to DataBind an ASP.NET CheckBoxList such that a string value in the data becomes the label of the check box and a bool value checks/unchecks the box? On my asp.net webform I have a CheckBoxList like this: <asp:CheckBoxList runat="server" ID="chkListRoles" DataTextField="UserName" DataValueField="InRole" />
 In the code behind I have this code: var usersInRole = new List<UserInRole> 
{ 
  new UserInRole { UserName = "Frank", InRole = false},
  new UserInRole{UserName = "Linda", InRole = true},
  new UserInRole{UserName = "James", InRole = true},
};

chkListRoles.DataSource = usersInRole;
chkListRoles.DataBind();
 I was kinda hoping that the check boxes would be checked when InRole = true. I've also tried InRole = "Checked". The results were the same. I can't seem to find a way to DataBind and automagically have the check boxes checked/unchecked. Currently I solve the problem by setting selected = true for the appropriate items in the DataBound event. Seems like there's a cleaner solution just beyond my grasp. Thank You

@TITLE:How can I call a static method on a variable class?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make some kind of function that loads and instantiates a class from a given variable. Something like this: <?php
function loadClass($class) {
  $sClassPath = SYSPATH."/classes/{$class}.php";
  if (file_exists($sClassPath)) {
    require_once($sClassPath);
    $class = $class::getInstance();
  }
}
?>
 If I use it like this: <?php
  loadClass('session');
?>
 It should include and instantiate the session class. BTW: the static getInstance function comes from this code: <?php
  function getCallingClass() {
    $backtrace = debug_backtrace();
    $method    = $backtrace[1]['function'];
    $file      = file($backtrace[1]['file']);
    $line      = $file[($backtrace[1]['line'] - 1)];
    $class     = trim(preg_replace("/^.+?([A-Za-z0-9_]*)::{$method}\(.*$/s", "\\1\\2", $line));

    if(! class_exists($class)) {
      return false;
    } return $class;
  }

  class Core {

    protected static $instances = array();

    public static function getInstance() {
      $class = getCallingClass();

      if (!isset(self::$instances[$class])) {
        self::$instances[$class] = new $class();
      } return self::$instances[$class];
    }

  }

?>
 The thing is that right now the way to use the functions in a class is this: <?php
  $session = session::getInstance();
?>
 But now I want to build that into a function so that I never again have to use that line of code. I just say loadClass('session'); and than I can use $session->blablablafunction();
@CODE:<?php
function loadClass($class) {
  $sClassPath = SYSPATH."/classes/{$class}.php";
  if (file_exists($sClassPath)) {

  }
}
?> <?php
  loadClass('session');

  function getCallingClass() {
    $backtrace = debug_backtrace();
    $method    = $backtrace[1]['function'];
    $file      = file($backtrace[1]['file']);
    $line      = $file[($backtrace[1]['line'] - 1)];
    $class     = trim(preg_replace("/^.+?([A-Za-z0-9_]*)::{$method}\(.*$/s", "\\1\\2", $line));

    if(! class_exists($class)) {
      return false;

EDITED 03/04/2009 15:05 Thanks to all for your responses, but I think I didn't explain myself well enough. I know enough of Firebug to do basic debugging, but my problem happens when I fetch some code in an Ajax call that has a problem with it.

<input type="button" value="test" onclick="ajaxErrorTest();" />
</body>
</html>
 and then, the contents of the data.json file is this: {'func':function(){console.log('loaded...');alert('hey');}}
 If you load the page in a browser and click the 'Test' button (and everything goes well) you'll get something in the console, and an alert box that says 'hey'. Now change the data.json file to this: {'func':function(){console.log('loaded...');alerts('hey');}}
 ...and click the 'Test' button again (no need to reload the page ;-) You get the console line, but no alert box... and no errors!!! this is the kind of errors I'm trying to debug.

We want to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. We can use the formula of the $n^{th}$ triangular number\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number}} to calculate the sum of all the multiples of a number $m$ below 1000. The formula of the $n^{th}$ triangular number is:

\begin{equation}
T_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n k = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}
\end{equation}

If the last multiple of $m$ below 1000 is $x$ then $n = \rfrac{x}{m}$. The sum of all the multiples of $m$ below 1000 is therefore:

\begin{equation}
m \times T_{\frac{x}{m}} = m \times \sum_{k = 1}^{\frac{x}{m}} k = \frac{x (\frac{x}{m} + 1)}{2}
\end{equation}

Thus the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is equal to:

\begin{equation}
3 \times T_{\frac{999}{3}} + 5 \times T_{\frac{995}{5}} - 15 \times T_{\frac{990}{15}} = \frac{999 \times 334 + 995 \times 200 - 990 \times 67}{2}

Edit: It would also be nice to be able to print the computed solution either on the screen or on paper. Computing the solution without printing it is useful for heating the room but it is so hot already with the onset of summer and global warming. In addition, printing the solution would teach me how to write a hello world program in LaTeX.

@TITLE:Angular 2: How to use/import the http module?
@CONTENT:I've been playing with Angular 2 Quickstart. How can I use/import http module in Angular 2? I've looked at Angular 2 Todo's .js, but it doesn't use the http module. I've added "ngHttp": "angular/http", to dependencies in package.json because I've heard Angular 2 is somewhat modular

@TITLE:Logo are not displayed in Actionbar, using AppCompat
@CONTENT:I don't know where I miss something, but I can't set my logo in my actionbar. My AndroidManifest.xml: <application 
    android:icon="@drawable/application_icon" 
    android:label="@string/icon_name"
    android:logo="@drawable/actionbar_logo"
    android:theme="@style/PolarTheme">
 And also I set my logo at my activity tag in manifest: <activity 
    android:name=".Main"
    android:theme="@style/PolarThemeLogo"
    android:logo="@drawable/actionbar_logo"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan">
    </activity>
 This is in my themes.xml: <style 
    name="PolarThemeLogo" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">  
    <item name="colorPrimary">@color/mainColor500</item>
    <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/mainColor700</item>
    <item name="colorAccent">@color/accentColorA200</item>

    <item name="actionBarStyle">@style/MyActionBarLogo</item>
    <item name="android:windowContentOverlay">@null</item>
    </style>
 My styles.xml: <style name="MyActionBarLogo" parent="@style/Widget.AppCompat.Light.ActionBar.Solid.Inverse">
    <item name="background">@color/mainColor500</item>
    <item name="displayOptions">useLogo</item>
    </style>
 In my Main.java: public class Main extends ActionBarActivity {

@SuppressLint("NewApi")
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);    
    ActionBar actionBar = getSupportActionBar();
    actionBar.setTitle("");
    actionBar.setDisplayUseLogoEnabled(true);
 Any ideas? UPDATE - SOLVED I removed all the android:logo attributes from my AndroidManifest.xml and I modified my MyActionBarLogo style like this: <style name="MyActionBarLogo" parent="@style/Widget.AppCompat.Light.ActionBar">
    <item name="background">@color/mainColor500</item>
    <item name="logo">@drawable/actionbar_logo</item>
    <item name="displayOptions">useLogo|showHome</item>
    </style>
 Now the actionbar is displaying my logo. :)

@TITLE:Check ssl protocol, cipher & other properties in an asp.net mvc 4 application
@CONTENT:Because of compliance reasons we have to switch off the support of some ciphers and SSL2 on our webservers. This is not really a problem, but we would also like to inform them, after their successful login into the website, that we suggest switching on TLS 1.2 in their browser in case they are not already connecting to the server with TLS 1.2. So the question I have is: How can I detect the protocol and cipher used in an https request to an ASP.net (MVC 4) application running in IIS? I know that there are ways to log the SCHANNEL request to the event log and then read them out again, but this sounds very ugly to me. And I have seen that the System.Net.Security.SslStream has the properties that I would need, e.g.: CipherAlgorithm, HashAlgorithm, KeyExchangeAlgorithm & SslProtocol, but I'm not sure where I can get these properties in my Controller Action in a mvc4 application.

@LINK:/questions/24085931/is-using-stdvector-stdshared-ptrconst-t-an-antipattern
@TITLE:Is using std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> > an antipattern?
@CONTENT:For a long time I was using std::vector and std::shared_ptr hand in hand. Recently I started using std::shared_ptr<const T> whenever a pointer to a const object was needed. This is all OK, since std::shared_ptr<T> can be cast to std::shared_ptr<const T> and then they share the same reference counter and everything feels natural. But when I try to use constructs such as std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> > I run into troubles. To simplify I will denote the two structures: template <class T>
using SharedPtrVector = std::vector< std::shared_ptr<T> >;

template <class T>
using SharedConstPtrVector = std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> >;
 The problem is that although SharedPtrVector and SharedConstPtrVector are very similar, SharedConstPtrVector cannot be cast to SharedPtrVector. So each time I want to be a const correct and write a function such as: void f(const SharedConstPtrVector<T>& vec);
 there is no way I can pass const SharedPtrVector<T> to f. I was thinking about this a lot and considered several alternatives: Write conversion functions template <typename T>
SharedConstPtrVector<T> toConst(const SharedPtrVector<T>&);
 Write code in generic form: template <typename T>
void f(const std::vector< std::shared_ptr<T> >& vec);
 or template <typename TIterator>
void f(TIterator begin, TIterator end);
 Abandon the idea of std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> > The problem with 1. is the computational overhead and increased uglyness of code, while 2. gives the code an "everything is a template" flavor. I am an inexperienced programmer and I don't want to set out in the wrong direction. I would like to hear advice from someone who has experience with this problem.
@CODE:std::vector std::shared_ptr std::shared_ptr<const T> std::shared_ptr<T> std::shared_ptr<const T> std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> > template <class T>
using SharedPtrVector = std::vector< std::shared_ptr<T> >;

template <class T>
using SharedConstPtrVector = std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> >; SharedPtrVector SharedConstPtrVector SharedConstPtrVector SharedPtrVector void f(const SharedConstPtrVector<T>& vec); SharedPtrVector<T> f template <typename T>
SharedConstPtrVector<T> toConst(const SharedPtrVector<T>&); template <typename T>
void f(const std::vector< std::shared_ptr<T> >& vec); template <typename TIterator>
void f(TIterator begin, TIterator end); std::vector< std::shared_ptr<const T> > f you can use pointers as well here as iterators std::vector::data vec.data() vec.data() + vec.size()

@TITLE:Creating anchored comments programmatically in Google Docs
@CONTENT:I have been unable to programmatically create a comment that is anchored to specific text in a Google Doc using an app script with the document. Google documentation about how to create an anchored comment using the Google Drive API: https://developers.google.com/drive/web/manage-comments Here is the code I have to create the comment in the doc: Drive.Comments.insert({
  "kind": "drive#comment",
  "author": {
    "kind": "drive#user",
    "displayName": USER_EMAIL,
    "isAuthenticatedUser": true,
  },
  "content": CONTENT,
  "status": "open",
  "anchor": "{'r':"
             + REVISION_ID
             + ",'a':[{'txt':{'o':"
             + STARTING_OFFSET
             + ",'l':"
             + OFFSET_LENGTH
             + ",'ml':"
             + TOTAL_CHARS
             + "}}]}", 
  "fileId": FILE_ID
}, FILE_ID);

 /* USER_EMAIL, CONTENT, REVISION_ID, FILE_ID: string,
    STARTING_OFFSET, OFFSET_LENGTH, TOTAL_CHARS: int  */
 In this case, I am trying to create a text anchor to specific characters in the doc which correspond to the STARTING_OFFSET and OFFSET_LENGTH. Currently this code creates a comment accessible in Google Docs; however, it is not anchored to any text in the document, which is necessary for the intended purpose. I have made sure that the current revision id is used (as this could cause issues, as mentioned in the Google documentation). Any suggestions are greatly appreciated and if any one could post or point to an example of creating anchored comments in Google Docs programmatically, I would be extremely grateful. Thanks in advance!
@CODE:Drive.Comments.insert({
  "kind": "drive#comment",
  "author": {
    "kind": "drive#user",
    "displayName": USER_EMAIL,

@LINK:/questions/23190107/cannot-use-jacoco-jvm-args-and-surefire-jvm-args-together-in-maven
@TITLE:Cannot use jacoco JVM args and surefire JVM args together in maven
@CONTENT:I am using maven with the jacoco plugin to generate code coverage metrics. I am having some difficulty in configuring the surefire plugin with the java options required by the jacoco plugin. I've seen some answers about this already on Stack Overflow but something is not working for me. I have a multi-module project, and one of my modules configures the surefire plugin as follows: foo/pom.xml: <plugins>
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
      <argLine>-XX:MaxPermSize=512m</argLine>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
</plugins>
 This works as expected. Now I want to incorporate jacoco to get code coverage metrics, so I added a CodeCoverage profile that handles all the jacoco configuration: parent/pom.xml: <profile>
  <id>CodeCoverage</id>
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
          <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <executions>
            <execution>
              <id>jacoco-initialize</id>
              <goals><goal>prepare-agent</goal></goals>
              <configuration>
                <propertyName>surefire.argLine</propertyName>
              </configuration>
              ...
            </execution>
          <executions> 
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>   
</profile>
 It is seen here that if the CodeCoverage profile is specified, then the jacoco plugin is configured to use the surefire.argLine property, and that property is used to configure the argLine for the surefire plugin. I then updated the pom.xml file for the foo module to use the surefire.argLine property generated by the jacoco plugin: foo/pom.xml: <plugins>
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
      <argLine>${surefire.argLine} -XX:MaxPermSize=512m</argLine>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
</plugins>
 This approach is specified in the jacoco plugin documentation (see [1]). When I build the foo module with the CodeCoverage profile, I see the following: [foo] $ mvn clean install -X -PCodeCoverage
...
[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.7.0.201403182114:prepare-agent (jacoco-initialize) @ foo ---

...

...
[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.7.0.201403182114:report (jacoco-site) @ foo ---
[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Foo' with 59 classes`
 So the jacoco plugin is executed, a surefire.argLine property is created, the argLine for the surefire plugin uses the surefire.argLine property and the local MaxPermSize argument, and a target\code-coverage\jacoc-ut-exec file is generated, as expected. However, if I do not use the CodeCoverage profile, then I get an error, because the ${surefire.argLine} property (used in foo/pom.xml) is not created by the jacoco plugin, and is not defined anywhere: [foo] $ mvn clean install -X
...
[DEBUG] Configuring mojo 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.13:test' with basic configurator -->
[DEBUG]   (s) argLine = ${surefire.argLine} -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
...
Error: Could not find or load main class ${surefire.argLine}`
 Sinec the jacoco plugin was not invoked, there's no surefire.argLine property created, hence the error. So, I go back to the parent/pom.xml and create this property, with no initial value: parent/pom.xml: <properties>
  <surefire.argLine></surefire.argLine>
</properties>
 Now when I build the foo module without using the CodeCoverage profile, I get no errors: [foo] $ mvn clean install -X
...
[DEBUG] Configuring mojo 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.13:test' with basic configurator -->
[DEBUG]   (s) argLine =  -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS`
 The surefire argline is now correct (using the empty surefire.argLine property) and there is no target\code-coverage directory, as expected. So now I go back to generating code metrics, using the CodeCoverage profile: [foo] $ mvn clean install -X -PCodeCoverage

[INFO] Skipping JaCoCo execution due to missing execution data file:...\foo\target\coverage-reports\jacoco-ut.exec
 It can be observed here that the jacoco plugin is invoked and sets the surefire.argLine property, but the surefire.argLine property with the empty value defined in the parent/pom.xml file is actually used to create the argline for the surefire plugin. As a result, there is no jacoco-ut.exec file, and no target\code-coverage directory, when I use the CodeCoverage profile. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong here. I'm declaring an argLine property as suggested by the jacoco documentation, and using it whenever a surefire plugin needs to specify additional argument. Other answers on Stack Overflow suggest creating a property with the same name as the jacoco argLine property to handle the case when jacoco is not invoked. Any suggestions? edit Maybe one solution is to explicitly declare the surefire.argLine property in the CodeCoverage profile, and forget about using the argLine of the jacoco plugin: <profile>
  <id>CodeCoverage</id>
  <properties>
    <surefire.argLine>-javaagent:${jacoco.agent.jar}=destfile=${jacoco.report.path}</surefire.argLine>
  </properties>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
        <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>jacoco-initialize</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
            </goals>
            <!-- no longer specifying 'argLine' for jacoco plugin ... -->  
          </execution>
        <executions> 
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <!-- ... instead the arg line is configured explicitly for surefire plugin. -->
          <argLine>${surefire.argLine}</argLine>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </plugin>
</build>
 This will create the surefire.argLine property to use the java agent required by the jacoco plugin, and configure the surefire plugin to use that property for its JVM args. The jacoco plugin will now create a argLine property, but this will be ignored. It's not an elegant solution (since I'm making assumptions about how the jacoco plugin works, and this may change in a future version). edit The jacoco.agent.jar property must also be set, by pointing to its location in the local repository (not sure if this is robust) or by using the dependency plugin to copy the jacoco agent jar to the local build directory: <profile>
  <id>CodeCoverage</id>
  <properties>
    <jacoco.agent.jar>${project.build.directory}/jacoco-agent.jar</jacoco.agent.jar>
    ...

 edit Not sure if using the dependency plugin is the right approach, or pointing to the jacoco agent artifact in the local repository: <profile>
  <id>CodeCoverage</id>
  <properties>
    <jacoco.agent.jar>${settings.localRepository}/org/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent/${jacoco.version}/org.jacoco.agent-${jacoco.version}-runtime.jar</jacoco.agent.jar>
  </properties>
  ...
</profile>
 This is simpler, and does not require copying an artifact to the local build directory, but is fragile: changes in the repository layout will break this. [1] http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/prepare-agent-mojo.html

@TITLE:Use a custom directory name instead of node_modules when installing with npm
@CONTENT:I create a package.json, I run npm install, it works alright. It creates a node_modules directory in my root folder (which I can change by using --prefix option). However, I don't like underscores all that much. I want to change the name of the directory NPM downloads the modules to. I want it to be named nmods or node-modules or something like that. Bower can do a similar thing by reading the directory property inside a .bowerrc file in the current dir. Is there a way to do the same with NPM?

@TITLE:Refresh or force redraw the fragment
@CONTENT:I have a fragment that inflates an xml layout. My requirement is to update the text size on all my views inside my fragment when my Activity is resumed. I tried     fragment.getView().invalidate();
 which didn't seem to do the work. I also tried     fragment.getView().requestLayout();
 which didn't work either. On another activity, I have a ListFragment which needs to do the same thing. I tried     listfragment.getListView().invalidate();
 which did the trick, refreshing my list view and redrawing all the items inside it. I don't understand why one works but not the other. I have also seen people recommending initiating a fragment transaction and replacing the current fragment with a new one, and it has kept me wondering Why should I create a whole new fragment and replace my current fragment when all I need is to refresh the text on the views that my fragment contains. Fragment transaction method will prevent me from defining my fragment in the layout xml of my activity and I will have to programatically insert the fragment at the right position. Is there any simple approach to this?

@LINK:/questions/14895052/container-of-fixed-dynamic-size
@TITLE:Container of fixed dynamic size
@CONTENT:Is there a standard container for a sequence of fixed length, where that length is determined at runtime. Preferrably, I'd like to pass an argument to the constructor of each sequence element, and use that argument to initialize a const member (or a reference). I'd also like to obtain the sequence element at a given index in O(1). It seems to me that all of my requirements cannot be met at the same time. I know std::array has fixed length, but that length has to be known at compile-time. std::vector has dynamic size, and allows passing contructor arguments using emplace. Although you can reserve memory to avoid actual reallocations, the type still has to be movable to theoretically allow such reallocations, which e.g. prevents const members. Then there is std::list and std::forwad_list, which don't require a movable type, but which are still resizable and will perform rather poorly under random-access patterns. I also feel that there might be considerable overhead associated with such lists, since each list node will likely be allocated separately. Strangely enough, std::valarray is my best bet so far, since it has a fixed length and won't resize automatically. Although there is a resize method, your type won't have to be movable unless you actually call that method. The main deficit here is the lack for custom constructor arguments, so initializing const members isn't possible with this approach. Is there some alternative I missed? Is there some way to adjust one of the standard containers in such a way that it satisfies all of my requirements? Edit: To give you a more precise idea of what I'm trying to do, see this example: class A {
  void foo(unsigned n);
};

class B {
private:
  A* const a;
  const unsigned i;
public:
  B(A* aa) : a(aa), i(0) { }
  B(A* aa, unsigned ii) : a(aa), i(ii) { }

  B(const B&) = delete;
  B(B&&) = delete;
  B& operator=(const B&) = delete;
  B& operator=(B&&) = delete;
};

void A::foo(unsigned n) {
  // Solution using forward_list should be guaranteed to work
  std::forward_list<B> bs_list;
  for (unsigned i = n; i != 0; --i)
    bs_list.emplace_front(std::make_pair(this, i - 1));

  // Solution by Arne Mertz with single ctor argumen
  const std::vector<A*> ctor_args1(n, this);
  const std::vector<B> bs_vector(ctor_args1.begin(), ctor_args1.end());

  // Solution by Arne Mertz using intermediate creator objects
  std::vector<std::pair<A*, unsigned>> ctor_args2;
  ctor_args2.reserve(n);

    ctor_args2.push_back(std::make_pair(this, i));

@TITLE:Lifetime extension and the conditional operator
@CONTENT:local lvalue references-to-const and rvalue references can extend the lifetime of temporaries: const std::string& a = std::string("hello");
std::string&& b = std::string("world");
 Does that also work when the initializer is not a simple expression, but uses the conditional operator? std::string&& c = condition ? std::string("hello") : std::string("world");
 What if one of the results is a temporary object, but the other one isn't? std::string d = "hello";
const std::string& e = condition ? d : std::string("world");
 Does C++ mandate the lifetime of the temporary be extended when the condition is false? The question came up while answering this question about non-copyable objects.

std::string&& b = std::string("world"); std::string&& c = condition ? std::string("hello") : std::string("world"); std::string d = "hello";

@TITLE:How do I work with images in a portable class library targeting Windows Store Apps and WP7,WP8,WPF?
@CONTENT:I am working on a first PCL that targets : WSA (Windows Store Application), WPF,WP7,WP8. We can say that it is a rolerdex kind of application, you have contacts , they have contact details and images. (it's not, but I can't give details about the application, so I am using a very simple example instead). Here are some of my questions :) Should I have the images in the PCL? If yes: How do reference the image for usage in WSA? How do I best solve scaling with the scale qualifiers etc. when used across different projects? I am not using a database and the images are not downloaded from an external service- I would like to keep the images (not many really) locally, in the app or in the PCL. EDIT: I just want to display images. That's it. It's a static rolerdex, you can't add new people. I just want to display 5 number of people and their image (in the PCL). How do I reference the images if it's a Windows Store Application? I have a binding and the DataContext is set to a ViewModel in the PCL. The ViewModel aggregates the data to be displayed from the models. The property I've bound against is MyImage. Ignoring the other platforms, how would the Uri look like? Everything else works fine. I really just want help with these three questions, although I really appreciate all the answers!!!

@TITLE:Cookies not being sent back and forth properly in Opera
@CONTENT:First off, I'm not sure whether this is a problem in Opera 12.01 or not, but the problem only occurs in Opera. I've tested in FF14, Chrome 21, Safari 5 (Windows) and Safari Mac and Webkit browsers on Android and iPhone. My application runs on the trigger.io forge platform and uses a proxy to route requests from the web application to the service. The proxy simply forwards the requests and cookies along and this works as expected in most of the browsers. After inspecting the request in dragonfly, I noticed that the server sends the proper headers in the response, but Opera seems to be ignoring setting the values. I'm wondering whether this is due to some misconfigured path value for the cookie. I've attached screenshots of 2 requests in Firefox and Opera. As you can see in the screens, FF sees the cookie headers and sets them appropriately, but Opera does not. Firefox Request Opera request 1 Screen Opera Request 2 Screen I haven't included the code from the proxy that does the request forwarding, so please let me know if you need that to gain some insight. On the service end, I'm running PHP and Codeigniter. Please let me know if I need to add any more info here on my environment, thanks. UPDATE : This issue occurs even in my production environment which does not use a custom TLD. Other sites that use cookies work fine and cookies are enabled.

@TITLE:Out of a git console: how do I execute a batch file and then return to git console?
@CONTENT:I have a small utility script called clear.bat that does some housekeeping work on my sources. It is a .bat file so that I could easily double-click it in Windows Explorer. Sometimes, I find it more handy to execute it from my Git bash (msysgit, if this matters). To do this, I type cmd
clear.bat
exit
 cmd turns my Git bash into a normal cmd window where I could easily execute my batch. When I type exit, the cmd environment is terminated and I'm back in my Git bash. Could this be achieved in an easier way? I tried cmd /C clean.bat since the docs say Syntax
      CMD [charset] [options]

      CMD [charset] [options] [/c Command] 

      CMD [charset] [options] [/k Command] 

Options   
   /C     Run Command and then terminate

   /K     Run Command and then return to the CMD prompt.
          This is useful for testing, to examine variables
 Edit: Just noticed that the post is broken. What I want is to execute clean.bat from within the Git bash without having to type the three commands above (cmd, clear.bat, exit). I just want to execute the .bat file from within my Git bash. Obvious way would be to create a separate .sh file that does the same work but this will lead to double code. Edit 2: When I execute cmd /C clean.bat, the Git bash turns into a plain CMD environment and only displays the prompt. The file clean.bat does not get executed. It's the same as if I just type cmd. Also, adding a /debug switch does literally nothing. Seems like only cmd gets evaluated and all further parameters are getting ignored.
@CODE:clear.bat .bat cmd

@LINK:/questions/11730828/clojure-and-dynamic
@TITLE:clojure and ^:dynamic
@CONTENT:I tried to understand dynamic variables and binding function so I tried this (clojure 1.3): user=> (defn f [] 
           (def ^:dynamic x 5) 
           (defn g [] (println x)) 
           (defn h [] (binding [x 3] (g))) 
           (h))
#'user/f
user=> (f)     
5
nil
 Confused, I tried this somewhat simpler code: user=> (def ^:dynamic y 5)
#'user/y
user=> (defn g [] (println y))
#'user/g
user=> (defn h [] (binding [y 3] (g)))
#'user/h
user=> (h)
3
nil
 What is the difference between the two pieces of code? Why does the second example work but the first does not? Hint: I just realized that the following works (still don't fully understand why): user=> (def ^:dynamic y 5)
#'user/y
user=> (defn f [] (defn g [] (println y)) (defn h [] (binding [y 3] (g))) (h))
#'user/f
user=> (f)

@TITLE:Eclipse - Publish & Run Simple Web Project
@CONTENT:I must be missing something really obvious but I just cannot work out how to publish & run a simple JavaScript & HTML project to an Apache server on a local VM. I have tried the locally installed Eclipse help but it always seems to come to an end without filling in the full details of what is required and there is no summary that gives a start to finish overview of what is needed to complete what should be a straightforward task. My project is simple, it is comprised of links to a single JavaScript file and a directory of HTML files. I have created a server, giving the details of the Apache server on the VM, as far as I can tell I now need to link the project with the server but I can't work out how to do this task. If I right click on the project and go to Run As/Configurations the Create, manage and run configurations window allows me to create a new configuration but the server select box contains no servers. I really have no idea whether that is what I need to be doing but I have tried so many options that I am now completely lost. In the server window it says 'started, synchronised' by the server but it isn't even attempting to write files to the server directory (which is mounted on my file system). I am using 'Eclipse IDE for JavaScript Developers' v1.4.1, 'Eclipse Platform' v3.7.1. Could anyone point me in the right direction for publishing and running a simple JavaScript & HTML project on a local Virtual Machine?

@TITLE:Storing and sending of http cookies not working in PhoneGap app
@CONTENT:I'm developing a PhoneGap app in Xcode that communicates with a server using a web api. The api accepts standard http requests. As part of the user authentication process a cookie is set that is supposed to be transmitted in the http header with each subsequent request to the api. During the login call to the api, I can clearly see that a cookie is being sent back as part of the response header. However, it doesn't seem to get stored, nor does it get sent in the http request header with each new api call. To make calls to the api, I'm using jQuery's $.getJSON call. I found the following question and answer: phonegap: cookie based authentication (PHP) not working [webview] The above answer suggests setting the NSHTTPCookieStorage cookieAcceptPolicy to NSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways in the app delegate's init. I have tried that and it doesn't seem to solve the issue. Also, according to Apple's documentation, the default cookieAcceptPolicy is NSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways. Suggestions on how to get cookie storage and sending working are highly appreciated.

 My questions are: Am I using the array['key']='value' syntax correctly? Why isn't array b working as expected? Why are arrays a and c displayed differently in the console?

NOTE: Google Chrome's Firebug displays only [] for array 'a', without the option to expand it.

But why doesn't jQuery's .each work with it? $.each(a, function ()

 This code, appended to the script, produces no alerts.

@CONTENT:In C++0x, you can use the using keyword to inherit constructors, like so: class B { B(int) {} };

class A : public B { using B::B; };
 Which will implicitly declare an A(int) constructor. Does this work with templates? class B { B(int) {} };

template<class T> class A : public T { using T::T; };
 Within T::T, I expect the compiler to figure out the left hand T since using the scope operator on template arguments is normal, but figuring out that the right hand T is the constructor is a special case. In fact it appears there's an ambiguity: what if I have a method called T in B that I'm trying to add overloads to in A (that's how a compiler would interpret such a using declaration pre-C++0x)?
@CODE:using class B { B(int) {} };

class A : public B { using B::B; }; A(int) class B { B(int) {} };

@TITLE:Rails 3 jquery date picker date not saving to database
@CONTENT:When I submit my form I can see the date being sent to in the post. However, It doesn't save the date. If I do a date check it says it is not in the proper format. Here is my date picker function, it displays fine:     $j(function(){
    $j("#mile_date").datepicker();
});
 the $j is because I am using prototype as well so all jquery calls are using the the noconflict variable. Here is the post:  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"£F??", "authenticity_token"=>"Fj4HW/B4EOan/vcPZLJ75TvWkRH4ZKSFsPLlQLSD0cI=", "mile"=>{"odometer"=>"", "trip"=>"428.2
", "gallons"=>"24.959", "note"=>"", "temperature"=>"", "date"=>"06/22/2011"}, "commit"=>"Create Mile"}
 So it sends the date fine but rails doesn't seem to like the format. It inserts a null value into the database. If I submit it with the default datefield with the drop downs it sends this and saves fine:     Parameters: {"utf8"=>"£F??", "authenticity_token"=>"Fj4HW/B4EOan/vcPZLJ75TvWkRH4ZKSFsPLlQLSD0cI=", "mile"=>{"odometer"=>"", "trip"=>"428.2

ommit"=>"Create Mile"}
 In the insert statement it inserts the date as:'2011-06-22' Does Rails expect the date in 3 variables to construct the date format correctly? How can I get the datepicker to send the correct date format? Thank you in advance,
@CODE:$j(function(){

@LINK:/questions/6198084/resize-catextlayer-to-fit-text-on-ios
@TITLE:Resize CATextLayer to fit text on iOS
@CONTENT:All my research so far seems to indicate it is not possible to do this accurately. The only two options available to me at the outset were: a) Using a Layout manager for the CATextLayer - not available on iOS as of 4.0 b) Use sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: and adjust the frame of the CATextLayer according to the size returned here. Option (b), being the simplest approach, should work. After all, it works perfectly with UILabels. But when I applied the same frame calculation to CATextLayer, the frame was always turning out to be a bit bigger than expected or needed. As it turns out, the line-spacing in CATextLayers and UILabels (for the same font and size) is different. As a result, sizeWithFont (whose line-spacing calculations would match with that of UILabels) does not return the expected size for CATextLayers. This is further proven by printing the same text using a UILabel, as against a CATextLayer and comparing the results. The text in the first line overlaps perfectly (it being the same font), but the line-spacing in CATextLayer is just a little shorter than in UILabel. (Sorry I can't upload a screenshot right now as the ones I already have contain confidential data, and I presently don't have the time to make a sample project to get clean screenshots. I'll upload them later for posterity, when I have the time) This is a weird difference, but I thought it would be possible to adjust the spacing in the CATextLayer by specifying the appropriate attribute for the NSAttributedString I use there, but that does not seem to be the case. Looking into CFStringAttributes.h I can't find a single attribute that could be related to line-spacing. Bottomline: So it seems like it's not possible to use CATextLayer on iOS in a scenario where the layer is required to fit to its text. Am I right on this or am I missing something? P.S: The reason I wanted to use CATextLayer and NSAttributedString's is because the string to be displayed is to be colored differently at different points. I guess I'd just have to go back to drawing the strings by hand as always....of course there's always the option of hacking the results from sizeWithFont to get the proper line-height. Abusing the 'code' tags a little to make the post more readable. I'm not able to tag the post with 'CATextLayer' - surprisingly no such tags exist at the moment.

 this.getInstrumentation().getTargetContext() is supposed to return an object of type context. But I get the android.app.ApplicationContext class cast exeption which doesn't make sense. Update 2: I did some more research and discovered this for android.app.Application java.lang.Object
    android.content.Context
        android.app.ApplicationContext

@TITLE:C# Entity Framework ¡§An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker¡¨
@CONTENT:This error is thrown a lot, but I can't find the solution. I am new to the Entity Framework and in my first approach I got this error. This is what I have. I have a company class and a branch class. Both classes have their own repository. A company has one Branch, while one branch can have multiple companies. In my GUI I fill a combo with Branch objects, which I get from my BranchRepository:     public IList<Branch> GetAllBranches()
    {
        var query = _context.Branches;

        IList<Branch> branches = query.ToList();

        return branches;
    }
 This is result is the datasource of the branch combobox. When I want to save the company, I do something like this: company.VisitorAddress = txtVisitAddress.Text;
company.City = txtCity.Text;
company.CompanyName = txtCompany.Text;
company.PhoneNumber = txtPhoneNumber.Text;
company.ZipCode = txtZipcode.Text;
company.Branch = ((Branch)cmbBranches.SelectedItem);
company.Website = txtWebsite.Text;
 Then, I call my company repository to save my company. Here is what the save method looks like: public bool Save(Company company)
{
    _context.AddToCompanies(company);   // <-- This is where the error is thrown.
    _context.SaveChanges();

    return true;
}
 When the save method is invoked, I get the error 'An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker'. Clearly I'm doing something wrong, but what?
@CODE:public IList<Branch> GetAllBranches()
    {
        var query = _context.Branches;

        IList<Branch> branches = query.ToList();

        return branches;
    } company.VisitorAddress = txtVisitAddress.Text;
company.City = txtCity.Text;
company.CompanyName = txtCompany.Text;
company.PhoneNumber = txtPhoneNumber.Text;
company.ZipCode = txtZipcode.Text;
company.Branch = ((Branch)cmbBranches.SelectedItem);
company.Website = txtWebsite.Text; public bool Save(Company company)
{
    _context.AddToCompanies(company);   // <-- This is where the error is thrown.

 can be rewritten shorter: MyClass a = new MyClass { Field1 = Value1, Field2 = Value2 }
 Object initializer code is more obvious but when properties number come to dozen and some of the assignment deals with nullable values it's hard to debug where the "null reference error" is. Studio shows the whole object initializer as error point. Nowadays I use object initializer for straightforward assignment only for error-free properties. How do you use object initializer for complex assignment or it's a bad practice to use dozen of assigments at all? Thank you in advance!

 it does a pull on the live web directory. However, while the push always succeeds, the post-update hook sometimes fails. The hook is pretty simple: #!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to prepare a packed repository for use over
# dumb transports.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "post-update".
cd /var/www
env -i git pull
 I'm pushing updates from a variety of places, but sometimes I have to login as root on the server and manuall do a env -i git pull
 I only have to do it 20% of the time though. Any ideas why it would fail randomly? Also, how would I get it to log error messages, since it might be running as someone who can't write to the file system?

@TITLE:Why is setting HTML5's CanvasPixelArray values ridiculously slow and how can I do it faster?
@CONTENT:I am trying to do some dynamic visual effects using the HTML 5 canvas' pixel manipulation, but I am running into a problem where setting pixels in the CanvasPixelArray is ridiculously slow. For example if I have code like: imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 500, 500);

for (var i = 0; i < imageData.length; i += 4){
    imageData.data[i] = buffer[i];
    imageData.data[i + 1] = buffer[i + 1];
    imageData.data[i + 2] = buffer[i + 2];
}

ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
 Profiling with Chrome reveals, it runs 44% slower than the following code where CanvasPixelArray is not used. tempArray = new Array(500 * 500 * 4);
imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 500, 500);

for (var i = 0; i < imageData.length; i += 4){
    tempArray[i] = buffer[i];
    tempArray[i + 1] = buffer[i + 1];
    tempArray[i + 2] = buffer[i + 2];
}

ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
 My guess is that the reason for this slowdown is due to the conversion between the Javascript doubles and the internal unsigned 8bit integers, used by the CanvasPixelArray. Is this guess correct? Is there anyway to reduce the time spent setting values in the CanvasPixelArray?
@CODE:imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 500, 500);

for (var i = 0; i < imageData.length; i += 4){
    imageData.data[i] = buffer[i];
    imageData.data[i + 1] = buffer[i + 1];
    imageData.data[i + 2] = buffer[i + 2];
}

ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0); tempArray = new Array(500 * 500 * 4);
imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 500, 500);

for (var i = 0; i < imageData.length; i += 4){
    tempArray[i] = buffer[i];
    tempArray[i + 1] = buffer[i + 1];
    tempArray[i + 2] = buffer[i + 2];
}

ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0); imageData tempArray imageData

@CONTENT:I've racked my brain for hours over this issue. I have created a main.xml and designed one for the res/layout-land (landscape) format and another one for portrait in res/layout. When I rotate the emulator (ctrl-F11), my app rotates properly to landscape using the correct main.xml, but a subsequent rotation back to portrait just keeps the landscape mail.xml. This was done in a 2.0 AVD.. Out of despiration I downloaded the new Sample Code for Multiple Resolutions and had to create a new 2.1 AVD, to my surprise rotation with this app works correctly as expected. So I then decided to try my app on the 2.1 AVD and it works perfectly. So, is this a Bug in a 2.0 AVD or is there something special I need to be doing for < 2.1 SDK versions? This is driving me crazy because no where did anyone mention this issue. Thanks in advance

@CONTENT:Do OpenSubKey() and other Microsoft.Win32 registry functions return null on 64-bit systems when 32-bit registry keys are under Wow6432node in the registry? I'm working on a unit testing framework that makes a call to OpenSubKey() from the .NET library. My development system is a Windows?7 64-bit environment with Visual?Studio?2008 SP1 and the Windows?7 SDK installed. The application we're unit testing is a 32-bit application, so the registry is virtualized under HKLM\Software\Wow6432node. When we call: Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey( @"Software\MyCompany\MyApp\" );
 Null is returned, however explicitly stating to look here works: Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey( @"Software\Wow6432node\MyCompany\MyApp\" );
 From what I understand this function should be agnostic to 32-bit or 64-bit environments and should know to jump to the virtual node. Even stranger is the fact that the exact same call inside a compiled and installed version of our application is running just fine on the same system and is getting the registry keys necessary to run; which are also being placed in HKLM\Software\Wow6432node. What should I do?

The issue is the primary key is a unique auto incrementing field, so there are intersections.

@TITLE:Why don't Haskell list comprehensions cause an error when pattern match fails?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to understand how Haskell list comprehensions work "under the hood" in regards to pattern matching. The following ghci output illustrates my point: Prelude> let myList = [Just 1, Just 2, Nothing, Just 3]
Prelude> let xs = [x | Just x <- myList]
Prelude> xs
[1,2,3]
Prelude>
 As you can see, it is able to skip the "Nothing" and select only the "Just" values. I understand that List is a monad, defined as (source from Real World Haskell, ch. 14): instance Monad [] where
    return x = [x]
    xs >>= f = concat (map f xs)
    xs >> f = concat (map (\_ -> f) xs)
    fail _ = []
 Therefore, a list comprehension basically builds a singleton list for every element selected in the list comprehension and concatenates them. If a pattern match fails at some step, the result of the "fail" function is used instead. In other words, the "Just x" pattern doesn't match so [] is used as a placeholder until 'concat' is called. That explains why the "Nothing" appears to be skipped. What I don't understand is, how does Haskell know to call the "fail" function? Is it "compiler magic", or functionality that you can write yourself in Haskell? Is it possible to write the following "select" function to work the same way as a list comprehension? select :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
select (Just x -> x) myList       -- how to prevent the lambda from raising an error?

@TITLE:Breaking ReadFile() blocking - Named Pipe (Windows API)
@CONTENT:To simplify, this is a situation where a NamedPipe SERVER is waiting for a NamedPipe CLIENT to write to the pipe (using WriteFile()) The Windows API that is blocking is ReadFile() The Server has created the synchronous pipe (no overlapped I/O) with blocking enabled The client has connected, and now the server is waiting for some data. In the normal flow of things, the client sends some data and the server processes it and then returns to ReadFile() to wait for the next chunk of data. Meanwhile an event occurs (user input for example) and the NamedPipe SERVER must now execute some other code, which it cannot do while the ReadFile() is blocking. At this point I need to mention that the NamedPipe Client is not my application, so I have no control over it. I cannot make it send a few bytes to unblock the server. It is just going to sit there and send no data. Since I do not have control of the Client implementation I cannot change anything on that end. One solution would be to create a separate thread in which all ReadFile() operations are performed. That way when the event occurs, I can just process the code. The problem with that, is that the event also requires a separate thread, so now I have two additional threads for each instance of this server. Since this needs to be scalable, this is undesirable. From another thread I have tried calling  DisconnectNamedPipe()
 and  CloseHandle()
 they both will not return (until the client writes to the pipe.) I cannot connect to the same pipe and write a few bytes because: "All instances of a named pipe share the same pipe name, but each instance has its own buffers and handles, and provides a separate conduit for client/server communication." http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365590.aspx I need a way to fake it out, So the $64k dollar question is: How can I break the blocking of ReadFile()?

If not, do you think that this will ever be possible or is there some sort of fundamental restriction as a result of Java's design? The environment is Linux with the Sun J2SE 1.6.0.11 jdk.

@TITLE:How do I copy files into an existing JAR with Ant?
@CONTENT:I have a project that needs to access resources within its own JAR file. When I create the JAR file for the project, I would like to copy a directory into that JAR file (I guess the ZIP equivalent would be "adding" the directory to the existing ZIP file). I only want the copy to happen after the JAR has been created (and I obviously don't want the copy to happen if I clean and delete the JAR file). Currently the build file looks like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project name="foobar" basedir=".." default="jar">

    <!-- project-specific properties -->
    <property name="project.path" value="my/project/dir/foobar" />

    <property name="jar.file" location="${test.dir}/foobar.jar" />    
    <property name="manifest.file" location="misc/foobar.manifest" />

@TITLE:What's the best way to trim whitespace from a string in Cocoa Touch?
@CONTENT:I'm looking to determine whether a string value from a user input (UITextField) is "blank" if it's not nil. Checking if [textField.text isEqualToString:""] isn't quite enough because I want to avoid any blank/whitespace input (like say a few space characters). There does seem to be an indication of a good solution for my particular problem in this StOv post. Basically it goes something like this, but I suspect there has to (or ought to) be a better way: NSString *strResult;
NSScanner* scanner = [NSScanner scannerWithString:textField.text];
BOOL hasValidChars = [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet] 
                                             intoString:&strResult];

// if hasValidChars == YES, we've got nonwhite space chars collected into strResult
 This clearly only works for my particular circumstance, and even then it would fail if the first character was a space but the data I wanted followed. So, I realize I've been a little spoiled by Ruby, but there must be a tried and true idiom for trimming strings in Cocoa. Aaaand the answer is already out there, my apologies: NSString's -stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet: would do it: Returns a new string made by removing from both ends of the receiver characters contained in a given character set. I'm still curious to hear if anybody has other/preferred ways of doing this.
@CODE:[textField.text isEqualToString:""] NSString *strResult;

@TITLE:Are there any good workarounds for FxCop warning CA1006?
@CONTENT:I am having trouble with FxCop warning CA1006, Microsoft.Design "DoNotNestGenericTypesInMemberSignatures". Specifically, I am designing a ReportCollection<T> class that inherits from ReadOnlyCollection<Report<T>>, and its public constructor takes an IList<Report<T>> as a parameter. The suggestion for fixing this warning is not very useful: "To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to remove the nested type argument." There are two ways I can see so far to change the design as suggested: Make the constructor internal. This doesn't work in my case. The constructor must be public because this collection class needs to be instantiable by code outside the assembly. Make the constructor take a Report<T>[] instead of an IList<Report<T>>. This is sub-optimal because external code should have the flexibility of using dynamically-sized data structures like List instead of fixed-size arrays. At this point, I have given up and suppressed this warning. Is there a better solution?

@CONTENT:I'm looking for tools that implement the distributed agent/service model ... I guess we could also call this grid or cloud computing, but I'm not sure the term is exactly analagous. A distributed agent model would be one where developers build agents that are dispatched to a framework and the framework executes the agent somewhere in the distributed environment. Specifically, I'm looking for a framework that support dynamic distribution across the grid/cloud, but replaces the transient agent with a more persistent service. The goal here is to minimize the amount of time and effort it requires to deploy a service into the grid/cloud container. FWIW, I think Digipede gets pretty close to this, but I'm interested in what else is out there. I'm under the impression that assembly distribution would have to be considered in order for the solution to be viable.

Then I suddenly realize that some data I have provided is wrong and that if it gets submitted, then I will face unwanted consequences (something like a shopping request where I may be forced to pay up for this incorrect request). So I frantically click the Stop button not just once but many times (just in case). What happens in such a scenario? Does the browser just cancel the request without informing the server? If in case it does inform the server, does the server just kill the process or does it also do some rolling back of all actions done as part of this request? I code in Java. Does Java have any special feature that we can use to detect STOP requests and rollback whatever we did as part of this transaction?
