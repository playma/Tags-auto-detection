@TITLE:Url Rewrite in a subdirectory
@CONTENT:I'm using Restler for building REST API on an Apache Server and I have some url rewrite problems. Here are my directories : /api: ??/vendor ??... ??.htaccess (1st level) ??/public : ????/examples ????/test ????/src ????.htaccess (2nd level) ????/explorer : ??????/css ??????/images ??????/lib ??????index.html Now, here is what I want : 1) I want an invisible "public" directory from the others. For example a request like GET mydomain.com/api/data will pick it directly into mydomain.com/api/public/data 2) I want the root of "public" directory to be explorer/index.html but this file load a lot of resources in a relative way and sometimes it don't load. So basically I want to access to /api/public/explorer/index.html with all the resources loaded if I only try to access to : mydomain.com/api Here is what I have now : Options +FollowSymLinks
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /api/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^public/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /api/public/$1
 For the first-level .htaccess, which seems to works pretty well <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/$ explorer/ [QSA,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

@TITLE:How to embed a Console in a Windows Form application?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to build a Text Adventure game in VB.net, just like the days of old. The obvious choice would be a Console application, however, I have decided on a Windows Form because I am hoping to include interactive buttons and pictures. Currently, I have already got on my form a picture box and a Rich Text Box. I was hoping that with the Rich Text Box I could achieve something that worked in the same way as a console. Alas, my efforts are futile. Everything I have tried has failed, including: reading Rich_Text_Box.Text and Rich_Text_Box_KeyUp with an if statement for enter being pressed to call the procedure for an enter button. I was wondering if there was any way to include a Console with standard Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine capabilities inside of my Form? This would very much shorten my task and streamline the whole process. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Dart create and transform an SVG path
@CONTENT:I recently started programming in Dart (www.dartlang.org). Now I try to display an SVG path and scale the path to fit in a div of 20px * 20px; I do have a path, and I did create a transformation matrix, but how does one apply the matrix to the path? My code so far:     // create an svg element
    SvgSvgElement svg = new SvgSvgElement();
    // create a path
    PathElement path = new PathElement();
    // draw something
    path.setAttribute('d', myPath);
    // add the path to the svg
    svg.append(path);
    // add the svg to a table cell allready in the DOM
    myDiv.append(svg);

    // start scaling
    // get bounding box
    Rect bb = path.getBBox();
    num xx = bb.width ==0 ? 1 : 20/bb.width;
    num yy = bb.height==0 ? 1 : 20/bb.height;
    num mm = min(xx, yy);

    // create svg transformation matrix to scale the image
    // |  x-prev  |   |a c e||  x-new  |   | ax-new + cy-new + e |
    // |  y-prev  | = |b d f||  y-new  | = | bx-new + dy-new + f |
    // |  z-prev  |   |0 0 1||    1    |   |         1           |
    Matrix matrix = svg.createSvgMatrix();
    matrix.a = mm; // xx
    matrix.b = 0;
    matrix.c = 0;
    matrix.d = mm; // yy
    matrix.e = -(bb.x * mm); // dx
    matrix.f = -(bb.y * mm); // dy

    // do something here to apply the transformation....
 --EDIT-- I've now read parts of the MDN after reading Carlo's reply. The SVG specs are much more complicated than I was anticipating. I got one step further though. I now try to apply the transformation matrix to the svg like so:     var a = svg.createSvgTransformFromMatrix(matrix);
    print('a: ' + a.toString());
 but this does not apply the transformation as I would expect. The print statement prints a: instance of 'Transform' , so I suspect I still have to apply this transformation somehow? --END EDIT-- And now I'm lost. How would I apply the transformation? I could not find any examples and the Dart API reference does not give me enough details to figure it out. Kind regards, Hendrik Jan

@TITLE:WP8 copy SharedStorge file directly into IsolatedStorage
@CONTENT:I am developing a Windows Phone 8 application but am having a lot of issues with file access permission exceptions hindering the approval of my application when ever I try accessing files in the "local" folder (this only happens after the application has been signed by the WP store, not when deployed from Visual Studio). To solve this I have moved all file operations to IsolatedStorage and this seems to have fixed the problems. I only have one problem left though. My application needs to make use of the file extension system to open external files and this seems to involve the file first being copied to the local folder where after I can then manually copy it into IsolatedStorage. I have no problem in implementing this but it seems that a file access permission exception also occurs once the system tries to copy the external file into the local folder. The only way I think this can be solved is if I can direct the system to directly copy into IsolatedStorage but I cannot figure how to do this or if it is even possible. It seems as if though the SharedStorageAccessManager can only copy into a StorageFolder instance but I have no idea how to create one that is directed into IsolatedStorage, any ideas? PS. Do you think that the Microsoft system might be signing my application with some incompetent certificate or something because there is not a hint of trouble when I deploy the application from Visual Studio, it only happens when Microsoft tests it or when I install it from the store using the Beta submission method. Below is a screenshot of the catched exception being displayed in a messagebox upon trying to open a file from an email: EDIT: Just to make it even clearer, I do NOT need assistance in figuring out the normal practice of using a deep link uri to copy an external file into my application directory. I need help in either copying it directly into isolatedstorage or resolving the file access exception.

@TITLE:Move a ball on mouse click in Java
@CONTENT:I'm trying to create the classic Breakout game as part of my programming assignment. I have to start moving the ball on a mouse click from the user. So I'm using a mouselistener to achieve that. The code below is just a smaller, simpler version of what I'm trying to do. But it does not move the ball in gradual steps. It just displays the ball at it's final position after the while loop is done executing. import acm.graphics.*;
import acm.program.*;
import acm.util.*;

import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class BallMoveTest extends GraphicsProgram {

    public void run() {
        ball = new GOval(20,20);
        ball.setFilled(true);
        add(ball, 100, 100);

        addMouseListeners();
    }

    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
        while (counter < 100) {
            moveBall();
            counter++;
            pause(20);
        }
    }

    public void moveBall(){
        ball.move(2, 2);
    }

    // Private instance variables
    private GOval ball;
    private int counter = 1;
}
 However this alternate code works wonderfully well, but does not allow the user to click to start the movement of the ball. import acm.program.*;
import acm.graphics.*;

public class TestGOval extends GraphicsProgram {

    public void run() {
        int counter = 1;
        GOval ball = new GOval(20,20);
        ball.setFilled(true);
        add(ball,100,100);

            ball.move(2, 2);
            counter++;
            pause(20);
        }

    }
}

        },
 only the first 3-4 classes are rendered. All following features will be coloured in the last (3rd/4th) class. This becomes more serious when I want to highlight the selected feature, where I create another query   var NumVal = e.row['name'].value;
 for an additional class         {
          where: "'name' = " + NumVal,
                polygonOptions: {
                    strokeColor: '#88d32f',

                    strokeWeight: 4
                }
        },
 Suddenly only this and the following class are used. All features are coloured in the following class only. Can anybody help? Why are suddenly queries/classes ignored when additional classes are added?

@TITLE:Parse sentence Stanford Parser by passing String not an array of strings
@CONTENT:Is it possible to parse a sentence using the Stanford Parser by passing a string and not an array of strings. This is the example they gave in their short tutorial (See Docs) : Here's example:     import java.util.*;
    import edu.stanford.nlp.ling.*;
    import edu.stanford.nlp.trees.*;
    import edu.stanford.nlp.parser.lexparser.LexicalizedParser;

    class ParserDemo {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        LexicalizedParser lp = LexicalizedParser.loadModel("edu/stanford/nlp/models/lexparser/englishPCFG.ser.gz");
        lp.setOptionFlags(new String[]{"-maxLength", "80", "-retainTmpSubcategories"});

        String[] sent = { "This", "is", "an", "easy", "sentence", "." }; // This is the sentence to be parsed
        List<CoreLabel> rawWords = Sentence.toCoreLabelList(sent);
        Tree parse = lp.apply(rawWords);
        parse.pennPrint();
        System.out.println();

        TreebankLanguagePack tlp = new PennTreebankLanguagePack();
        GrammaticalStructureFactory gsf = tlp.grammaticalStructureFactory();
        GrammaticalStructure gs = gsf.newGrammaticalStructure(parse);
        List<TypedDependency> tdl = gs.typedDependenciesCCprocessed();
        System.out.println(tdl);
        System.out.println();

      }

}
 I am trying to see if I can do this because I need to get sentences from a MySQL database and parse them directly as strings. I could tokezine the sentences and add the words, commas, and period to a String Array, However, to tokenize these sentences, I would have to use the Stanford Tokenizer , PTBTokenizer. The constructor of this tokenizer as listed here (See Docs) requires a "java.io.FileReader" Object, but I am not reading a file from directory. So I am wondering if there is a way to either Parse the sentence directly by passing a string, or if I can solve my problem by tokenizing the sentence without requiring a "java.io.FileReader" Object.
@CODE:import java.util.*;
    import edu.stanford.nlp.ling.*;
    import edu.stanford.nlp.trees.*;
    import edu.stanford.nlp.parser.lexparser.LexicalizedParser;

    class ParserDemo {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        LexicalizedParser lp = LexicalizedParser.loadModel("edu/stanford/nlp/models/lexparser/englishPCFG.ser.gz");
        lp.setOptionFlags(new String[]{"-maxLength", "80", "-retainTmpSubcategories"});

        String[] sent = { "This", "is", "an", "easy", "sentence", "." }; // This is the sentence to be parsed
        List<CoreLabel> rawWords = Sentence.toCoreLabelList(sent);
        Tree parse = lp.apply(rawWords);
        parse.pennPrint();
        System.out.println();

        TreebankLanguagePack tlp = new PennTreebankLanguagePack();
        GrammaticalStructureFactory gsf = tlp.grammaticalStructureFactory();
        GrammaticalStructure gs = gsf.newGrammaticalStructure(parse);
        List<TypedDependency> tdl = gs.typedDependenciesCCprocessed();

@CONTENT:My DataBase contains 1000's of images on server , I have to display these images in ListView in Android. I have to develop similar List like that in the Flipcart app(If User Scroll then download Images) and store a local copy in SQlite and display from that SQlite database. (In future if connectivity would not be there then also I would be able to run my app) because Images will be available in SQlite. Please suggest proper Solution for that. Use of loaderManager or something else please suggest

@TITLE:How to work-around Microsoft.Phone.Storage.NativeFileStream bug
@CONTENT:On Windows Phone 8 I have run in to an issue while reading files from the SD card using ExternalStorageFile.OpenForReadAsync(), which is the only way to read an SD card located file on Windows Phone. Investigating further it seems that the Microsoft.Phone.Storage.NativeFileStream has a bug in it which means Seek and SetFilePointer don't work as they should. More detail is given here. Does anyone have any suggestions how I can work-around this platform bug? I thought maybe I could inherit from Microsoft.Phone.Storage.NativeFileStream and override the buggy methods, but NativeFileStream doesn't seem to be available and I'm not sure what the correct code should be anyway. Or perhaps I can force this Stream into my own Stream class where I can control these methods? Perhaps I could pad the file I need to open with garbage at the beginning so I can start my seeks in the "higher 32bits of the long"? The file is specific to my app so it doesn't need to be opened by anything else. Any ideas for a work-around? A bit of a lower level problem than I'm used to dealing with so keep to hear some ideas.

@LINK:/questions/20810276/no-navigation-bar-in-view
@TITLE:No navigation bar in view
@CONTENT:I have following structure in my iOS app: RootViewController (table view controller showing core data). On RootViewController is a view including 4 buttons. Button 1: Menu... After pressing button 1, NSManagedObjectContext is passed to MenuViewController. On MenuViewController there are several buttons, one of them is used to open DoneViewController, which is a duplicate from RootViewController (only NSPredicates changed to show different core data objects. DoneViewController is showing correctly the expected rows, but it was supposed to have a navigation bar, which is not shown. This is the code used to open DoneViewController: - (IBAction)doneToDoaction:(id)sender {
    DoneViewController *viewController = [[DoneViewController alloc] init];
    viewController.managedObjectContext = [self mainContext];
    [self presentViewController:viewController animated:YES completion:nil];
}
 What should I do to open the view and have a navigation bar like RootViewController does? I will now put all the navigation controller instances that are now in my app: //AppDelegate.m
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  // Fetch the data to see if we ought to pre-populate
  NSError *error = nil;
  if (![[self fetchedResultsController] performFetch:&error]) {
    NSLog(@"Unresolved error %@, %@", error, [error userInfo]);
    abort();
  }

  [self loadFavoriteThingsData];


  RootViewController *rootViewController = (RootViewController *)

    [navigationController topViewController];
  [rootViewController setManagedObjectContext:[self managedObjectContext]];


  [window addSubview:[navigationController view]];
  [window makeKeyAndVisible];
  return YES;
}

//RootViewController
- (IBAction)MenuToDoAction:(id)sender {

    MenuViewController *viewController = [[MenuViewController alloc] init];

    viewController.mainContext = [self managedObjectContext];
    [self presentViewController:viewController animated:YES completion:nil];

}

//MenuViewController
- (IBAction)doneToDoaction:(id)sender {
    DoneViewController *viewController = [[DoneViewController alloc] init];
    viewController.managedObjectContext = [self mainContext];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES];
}
 The last doneToDoaction method, as proposed by @EricLee, doesn't throw an exception, but the button action is not executed and the app freezes...

 This is how the output is supposed to look. f's activity starts.

f's activity starts.

f's activity starts.

f's activity ends.

f's activity ends.

f's activity ends.

Done.
 Sometimes I got that output but not always, most of the time looks like this f's activity starts. f's activity starts.

f's activity starts.

f's activity ends.

f's activity ends.

Done.

@TITLE:Android - Webview page requires double clicking - how to handle?
@CONTENT:My app is simply a WebView to display a specific website. Users are not able to simply use the Chrome app because of the inherent programming in Android which alters the functions of tapping. For simplicity, let's say the website displays a calendar and on that calendar are boxes. The boxes can either be single clicked to be selected or double clicked to be opened to display the event details. The website has coding that handles what to do if an event is single or double clicked: <div class="boardpiece clickable" onclick="select(event, this);" ondblclick="open('5657849');"
 I'm completely fine with using longpress to simulate the double click. Here's where my confusion begins. How to I tell my app that when the user performs a SingleTap on the item, it needs to activate the "onclick" the website is calling for? I also need to tell the app that when the user performs a longpress on that same item, activate the "ondblclick" event you see there in the website coding?

 The problem is that it always echoes back "FAIL" and I want to see success for a change, does someone know if I did something wrong? Is it because there is a relation: one to one between persons and users that it doesn't work?

@TITLE:Can not display target scene after click on row of SearchResultTableView in my navigation controller
@CONTENT:I want to filter a list of entries via UISearchBar and show the details after user clicks a result row. Full list view and details view are linked via a navigation controller. The normal use case (without search) works like charm:  (ListOfAllEntries)
 => (direct click on row)
 ==> (Details view for row)
 This is what should also work: (ListOfAllEntries) 
=> (Search)                  - OK!
==> (ListOfFilteredEntries)  - OK!
===> (click on result row)          - OK!
====> (Details view for row) - BOOUUMMM! UI and Nav.Ctrl broken
 I am using a UISearchBar (with UISearchDisplayController) to filter an underlying UITableView. As Apple recommends the filtered search results are displayed in the default second table view (searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView) on top of my original table view with all entries. Everything works fine - the entries are filtered, and I get the right result row indexpath. Until the user clicks a search result row and I want to push the details view for the selected row on top of the navigation controller. My target details view displays BUT then my program is broken in the following ways: the target view displays slided below the navigation bar (see image#2) If I press "BACK" on the navigation bar I get an empty screen (see image#3) and after a further BACK click my app crashes) uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: 'Can't add self as subview' I tried displaying the target view (scene) with a segue: if (tableView == self.searchController.searchResultsTableView) {
    [self performSegueWithIdentifier: @"showFoods" sender: self];
}
 and I tried to display the target view via direct push: FoodViewController *fvc = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"FoodViewController"];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:fvc animated:YES];
 Both approaches result in the same wrong app behavior. See my images: Why is my details list below the navigation bar? Why is the navigation stack garbled after I push my details scene? Any hint would be appreciated. UISearchbar in action: After click on search result row - my details scene slides below the navigation bar After pressing "BACK" the scene with all entries does not display My storyboard. Note: The red arrow marks the problem. (The segue in the storyboard works well. But If I want to grammatically go the way of the red arrow, my UI is messed up!).
@CODE:(ListOfAllEntries)
 => (direct click on row)

@TITLE:WP8 LongListSelector - Navigating to different pages
@CONTENT:I have recently created a LongListSelector for my Windows Phone 8 app. However what I want to achieve now is to navigate to another page when the user taps on an item but I don't know what put in my code and also I'm not 100% as to where I should insert my uri's for each individual page. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? I would be grateful if anyone could help me with this matter. Many thanks. Partial Public Class Station_Chooser

@TITLE:Xtext and EMF modeling - Opposite relations parsing
@CONTENT:I'm currently playing around with XText and EMF a I've come to a dead end in the following. I've got an ecore model which I've created in the diagram editor. I don't provide the XML representation, it should be clear from the example. Some of the relations are opposite to each other (like the parent-children relation). This binding works perfectly fine when I create the instances programatically. A code of a test that successfully passes is included below. However, when I parse the model using XText, these opposite relations aren't set. I can't find a way to fixing this. The relations are strictly one-directional as the appear in the input file. Is there any way to force Xtext to set these, or am I supposed to resolve these manually? Passing test WordsFactory factory = WordsFactory.eINSTANCE;

// Prepare a simple dictionary hierarchy

Dictionary d = factory.createDictionary();

Synset s = factory.createAdjectiveSynset();

s.setDescription("A brief statement");

Word w = factory.createWord();
w.setName("word");
ws.setWord(w);

@TITLE:Prevent destructor from being called manually
@CONTENT:I have this class: class Test
{
    private $test = 'ok';

    public function doTest()
    {
        echo $this->test;
    }

    public function __destruct()
    {
        $this->test = 'not ok';
    }
}
 and the following test case: $test = new Test;
$test->__destruct(); // I wish this would throw a Fatal Error or something...
$test->doTest(); // prints "not ok"
 What I want to accomplish is to prevent __destruct() from being called manually, so that doTest() will never print "not ok". I tried setting the destructor's visibility to private, but that just leads to a Fatal Error on object destruction. An option would be to set a flag $this->destructed in the destructor and then throw an Exception in doTest() if this flag is true, but it wouldn't be very efficient to check for this flag every time the method is called. So, a private destructor is not possible and a flag $this->destructed is ugly. Are there better ways?
@CODE:class Test
{
    private $test = 'ok';

    public function doTest()
    {
        echo $this->test;
    }

    public function __destruct()
    {
        $this->test = 'not ok';
    }
} $test = new Test;
$test->__destruct(); // I wish this would throw a Fatal Error or something...
$test->doTest(); // prints "not ok" __destruct() doTest() private $this->destructed doTest() private $this->destructed

@TITLE:add custom numbers to ggplot legend
@CONTENT:I'm drawing a geom_tile plot where i have each point with a specific p-value. The plot is drawn in a nice way with the p-value limits on the legend. What i want to add to this legend is the number of data points which have this p-value. Example: the legend is something like that (with a color for each value): 0.05
0.04
0.03
0.02
0.01
 what i want to have is something like this: 0.05 58
0.04 34
0.03 85
0.02 54
0.01 10
 how can i add this to the legend of ggplot2 plots? I tried using geom_text and change the text position to the legend, but it did not worked. UPDATE pl <- ggplot(df.new) + geom_tile(aes(fill=z, x, y)) + 
      scale_fill_gradient(low="yellow", high="red", name="Legend1") + 
      stat_contour(breaks=c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05), aes(x=x, y=y, z=npvalue, colour=..level..)) +
      scale_colour_gradient2(low="black", mid="black", high="green", labels=paste(levels(c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05))))
 I have this plot, I'm drawing the geom_tile correctly from the z variable then im drawing a stat_contour based on the p-value. And i want to edit the labels for the stat_contour colors which are based on the p-value as in my initial question, but i'm having this error : Error in scale_labels.continuous(scale, breaks) : 
  Breaks and labels are different lengths
 Where is the problem in my plotting??

@TITLE:how to define a module pattern for an array of products with products properties?
@CONTENT:The webpage I'm developing loads some product information of a varying number of products from the database. I'd like to save this product info in a module pattern (simulating static variables) so it can be used by various javascript functions on the webpage. Each productitem has a (same) number (and same type) of product properties such as 'name', 'type' and 'price'. At the moment I use the structure as illustrated in the simplified example below. This structure uses various arrays, one for each product product property, but I was wondering how to define a more elegant (clearer) structure with an array of products and productproperties per array element? I read a lot on this site and other pages about defining javascript arrays and defining module patterns, but still couldnt figure this out... module = function(){
 var name = [],
     price = [],
     type = [];

 var init = function(){ // initialises the productproperties of all products; to be elaborated later
 };

 return{init:init}
}();
@CODE:module = function(){
 var name = [],
     price = [],
     type = [];

 var init = function(){ // initialises the productproperties of all products; to be elaborated later
 };

 return{init:init}
}();

       //...code continues
 The behaviour I was expecting was run() to be called and when ~testDevice() destructor is called abort is set to true and wait blocks the destructor, and runreturns and then the destructor continues. What is happening is that run() is called and when I close the application the destructors ~testDevice() is called and abort is set to true and wait() returns and the destructor finishes...BUT then run() keeps running and I get Unhandled exception at 0x71241a95 in project.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation.....I am running this as VS2010 debug, if I place breakpoints I get this all the time, but with no breakpoints I just got this once in a while...any clues? Something weird is that when I place a breakpoint in abort = true; sometimes the first breakpoint that hits in there has a small blue '!' sign, and the second time it hits is a regular all red one. The same happens for the breakpoint at emit deviceConnected(_connected); but this is kinda random as well...I dont know what this '!' means...could all of this be a debug problem? My general suspicion is that HIDAPI is running in a separate thread and it has its own bugs when someone call hid_exit(); maybe hid_read(); continues to run and since hid_quit(); was called, hid_read(); looses some pointers and doesnt close...just a wild shot and to confirm this I need some developer at the HIDAPI to come foward and say something...I hope they read this

@TITLE:OpenGL / GLSL - Uniform block data values incorrect
@CONTENT:My shader has a uniform block as such: layout (std140) uniform LightSourceBlock
{
    vec3 test;
    vec3 color;
} LightSources;
 The data for this block is supposed to come from a buffer object which is created like so: GLuint buffer;
glGenBuffers(1,&buffer);

GLfloat data[6] = {
    0,0,0,
    0,0,1
};
glBindBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER,buffer);
glBufferData(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER,sizeof(data),&data[0],GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);
 The buffer is linked to the uniform block before rendering: unsigned int locLightSourceBlock = glGetUniformBlockIndex(program,"LightSourceBlock");
glUniformBlockBinding(program,locLightSourceBlock,8);
glBindBufferBase(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER,8,buffer);
 From my understanding this should be setting 'color' inside the block in the shader to (0,0,1), but the value I'm getting instead is (0,1,0). If I remove the 'test' variable from the block and only bind the three floats (0,0,1) to the shader, it works as intended. What's going on?
@CODE:layout (std140) uniform LightSourceBlock
{
    vec3 test;
    vec3 color;

glGenBuffers(1,&buffer);

@TITLE:Emacs killing buffers
@CONTENT:(Emacs newbie here) Sometimes a Help buffer gets opened in my emacs editor. It opens in a different pane, splitting the current window into two halves vertically. When I use C-k buffer-name, to kill a buffer (say Help), some other buffer (say scratch) gets opened automatically in that pane. Is it possible to revert to my previous configuration, after a random buffer (Help or Debug..) gets opened. My previous configuration would be to go back to a single window with no panes

@CONTENT:Do anybody know why this regex: /^(([a-zA-Z0-9\(\)????????????,\.¢X-]+ *)+)$/
 works but this one doesn't: /^(([a-zA-Z0-9????????????,\.¢X-\(\)]+ *)+)$/
 The difference is the place where the parenthesis are... I tryed with some online PHP regex testers and got the same result. The second one simply doesn't work... PHP returns: preg_match(): Compilation failed: range out of order in character class at offset 44 in...
 This is not a critic question because I've managed to make it work but I have the curiosity! Maybe the unicode characters are changing something?

@TITLE:Processing AJAX response consisting of two logically separate HTML markup sections
@CONTENT:I am having a data response consisting of two entirely separate sections from a presentation point of view but which are logically connected on the server side and therefore are more efficiently generated in one AJAX call. The two sections have to populate two separate divs. My question is what is the most optimal method to do this? OPTION1: Generate the response on the server side as:   <div id="first_section">
   ...
  </div>
  <div id="second_section">
   ...
  </div>
 Load the response in a dummy div as in $('#dummydiv').html(response) and then extract individual sections as in $('#first_section).html() and $('#second_section).html() and use their return string to populate the target div as in   $('#target_div1').html( $('#first_section).html());
  $('#target_div2').html( $('#second_section).html());
 OPTION 2: Write JS to process the response as one big string, use some regular expressions to parse and return the two separate sections as two individual strings to be assigned to the .html() of the target divs. OPTION 3: Have two separate AJAX calls, one for each div (expensive duplicate option as the server-side computing is very connected). OPTION 4: Any suggestions? Since this is something that I need to do consistently in the application, the right approach is very important. Any comments OR A DIFFERENT APPROACH ALTOGETHER will be appreciated. UPDATE: The response is presentation (lot of markup generated on the server side to the data) and not data intensive. JSON would be a wrong choice I think as it would require markup to be generated on the client side.
@CODE:<div id="first_section">
   ...
  </div>
  <div id="second_section">
   ...
  </div> $('#target_div1').html( $('#first_section).html());
  $('#target_div2').html( $('#second_section).html());

@TITLE:How do I accommodate opening and closing dates NSDate comparator on separate days?
@CONTENT:Comparing dates is quite complex. I have an app that is comparing opening and closing dates for stores and it works great for times in the same day, i.e. opening a 8am and closing at 5pm the same day. Here is the code that compares the time: if ([self timeCompare:openDate until:closeDate withNow:now]) {
        NSLog(@"TIMECOMPARATOR = timeCompare>OPEN");
        status = YES;
    } else {
        NSLog(@"TIMECOMPARATOR = timeCompare>CLOSED");
        status = NO;
    }

    return status;
 This calls the following method: +(BOOL)timeCompare:(NSDate*)date1 until:(NSDate*)date2 withNow:(NSDate*)now{
    NSLog(@"TIMECOMPARE = open:%@ now:%@ close:%@", date1, now, date2);
    return ([date1 compare:now] == NSOrderedAscending && [date2 compare:now] == NSOrderedDescending);
}
 The problem comes when the closing time is "assumed" by a person but of course not by a computer, to close at the next day, such as 7am to 2am. I obviously mean the next day. How do I accommodate for this to signal the computer to be the next day?
@CODE:if ([self timeCompare:openDate until:closeDate withNow:now]) {
        NSLog(@"TIMECOMPARATOR = timeCompare>OPEN");
        status = YES;

        NSLog(@"TIMECOMPARATOR = timeCompare>CLOSED");
        status = NO;
    }

    return status; +(BOOL)timeCompare:(NSDate*)date1 until:(NSDate*)date2 withNow:(NSDate*)now{
    NSLog(@"TIMECOMPARE = open:%@ now:%@ close:%@", date1, now, date2);
    return ([date1 compare:now] == NSOrderedAscending && [date2 compare:now] == NSOrderedDescending);

@TITLE:How to copy variables from a custom class array on host into a float array on device in CUDA
@CONTENT:I am using CUDA. I have the following class on host: class Particle{
     public:
     float x;
     float v;
     // several other variables
}
 Then I have a vector of particles vector <Particle> p_all(512);
 On the GPU, I want to operate on an array of all x's (taken from all the Particles), and want to copy the data from the Particles array into a float array on device. I have a hunch that cudaMemcpy can be used, and I tried the following code, but it gives invalid pitch error. cudaMalloc( (void**) &pos_dev, sizeof(float)*512);
cudaMemcpy2D( (void*) &pos_dev, sizeof(float), (void*)&p_all[0].x, sizeof(Particle), sizeof(Particle), 512*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
 Is it at all possible to do so? Of course, the backup solution is to create an array of x's using a for loop and then copy it to the device. But I am looking for a more efficient solution. Thanks. FULL CODE BELOW. #include <cuda_runtime.h>

 This is what I did: library(vegan)
library(psych)

mydata <- read.csv(file="L5_filt.txt", header=T, row.names=1, sep="\t")
mydata_t <- t(as.matrix(mydata))
graph.f<-graph.adjacency(cor.matrix$r, weighted=TRUE, mode="upper")

t.names <- colnames(cor.matrix)[as.numeric(V(t.graph)$name)]
graph.f = simplify(graph.f)
 I want to plot only strong correlations (>+0.6 and <-0.6) I want different colors for edges relative to positive and negative correlations! E(graph.f)[weight < 0.6 & weight > -0.6]$width<-0
E(graph.f)[weight > 0.6]$width<-2.5
E(graph.f)[weight < -0.6]$width<-2.5
E(graph.f)[weight > 0.6]$color<-"red"
E(graph.f)[weight < -0.6]$color<-"green"

par(mai=c(1,1,0.1,0.15), mar=c(1, 0, 1, 1), mgp=c(2,1,0), mfrow=c(1,2), cex=0.7, lwd=0.5)
plot (graph.f, vertex.size=5, vertex.shape="circle", vertex.label.color="red", 
    vertex.label=t.names, vertex.label.cex=0.9, layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold)
 The result is really near to what I want, but I don't know how to delete from the plot the vertices with weak correlations (I mean the nodes related to the edges for which I set width=0) and the names of these vertices. How can I modify my code? Thanks!

@CONTENT:When we run the following command in PowerShell: get-date | sc C:\temp\date.log
 it creates date.log file with current date. But if we run the same via CMD: powershell get-date | sc C:\temp\date.log
 It complains: ERROR: Unrecognized command DESCRIPTION:

 Apparently, CMD confuses pipeline meant for POSH, with its own. Can anyone point me how to make it run via CMD? Thanks in anticipation.

@TITLE:UIButton image doesn't change when tapped
@CONTENT:I need to have an image button change to a different image when I tap it. Simple enough, and there are samples out there, but they don't work for me. This is what I tried following the examples: UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
button.frame = CGRectMake(20, 270, 200, 40.0);
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"butterfly3.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"clicked.png"] forState:UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted];
[button addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonPressed) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown];
[button setTitle:@"Submit" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[scrollView button];
 Now, I notice that my button is set to perform its action on UIControlEventTouchDown so I added it to the "clicked" control states like this: [button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"clicked.png"] forState:UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted | UIControlEventTouchDown];
 but the image still stays the same. What am I missing?
@CODE:UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
button.frame = CGRectMake(20, 270, 200, 40.0);
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"butterfly3.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"clicked.png"] forState:UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted];
[button addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonPressed) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown];
[button setTitle:@"Submit" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[scrollView button]; UIControlEventTouchDown [button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"clicked.png"] forState:UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted | UIControlEventTouchDown]; UIControlStateHighlighted UIControlStateSelected UIControlStateSelected [button setSelected:YES]; UIControlStateSelected UIControlStateHighlighted ¡V...forState: UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted 0x05 0x04 0x01 UIControlEventTouchDown UIControlState

 I'm trying to call ajax multiple times to load data in a set of divs: 24 of them, they start with divTime0, divTime1, divTime2, divTime3...... divTime23. Each time its called, the value for the TimeSlot corresponds with the div e.g. TimeSlot=0 goes in divTime0. I know the ajax calls here are overriding each other but have no idea how to solve it without writing out 24 blocks of code to get it working. N.B. this is working if i execute singularly without the for loop but it will just populate 1 of the 24 divs The following code worked to load 24 divs with images: for(var x=0 ; x<=23 ; x++)
    document.getElementById("timeanalysisimg"+x).src="ajax.php?id=15&AreaID=" +encodeURIComponent(AreaID); 
 I'm trying to do something similar without having to write unnecessary code. Any ideas? I got it working. Just pasting the solution for(var x=0 ; x<=9 ; x++)

    public static String decryptuser(Users user){

        byte[] pwh=pbkdf2(user.getPassword().toCharArray(),pws,iterations,hashbytesize);
        user.setPassword(toHex(pwh));
        byte[] sas=new byte[saltbytesize];
        sR.nextBytes(sas);
        byte[] sah=pbkdf2(user.getsA().toCharArray(),sas,iterations,hashbytesize);
        user.setsA(toHex(sah));
        user.setUserhash(pws);
        user.setSahash(sas);
        return user;
    }

    public static boolean hashpassword(String username,String password,Users user) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException{
        byte[] pws=user.getUserhash();
        byte[] pwh=pbkdf2(password.toCharArray(),pws,iterations,hashbytesize);
        String searcher=toHex(pwh)+username;
        String searched=user.getPassword()+user.getUsername();
        if(searcher.equals(searched)){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
     }

        {
            PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, bytes * 8);
            SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(algorithm);
            return skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
        }
    private static String toHex(byte[] array)
    {
        BigInteger bi = new BigInteger(1, array);
        String hex = bi.toString(16);
        int paddingLength = (array.length * 2) - hex.length();
        if(paddingLength > 0)
            return String.format("%0" + paddingLength + "d", 0) + hex;
        else
            return hex;
    }



     }

 I couldn't find appropriate to se the tree dynamically from my code using SetTree(string topLevelName) method, hence I added setTree(TreeViewModel tree) method to suit my needs. Can anyone please help me to implement GetTree() method to get list of items that is checked. If an item of the tree is selected, the TreeViewModel's IsChecked property is set to true. So IsChecked can be used to find if the item is selected r not.

        _isChecked = value;

        if (updateChildren && _isChecked.HasValue) Children.ForEach(c => c.SetIsChecked(_isChecked, true, false));

        if (updateParent && _parent != null) _parent.VerifyCheckedState();

        NotifyPropertyChanged("IsChecked");
    }

    {

        for (int i = 0; i < Children.Count; ++i)
        {

@TITLE:Why do I have an excessive amount of space in a UITableView section header?
@CONTENT:I have used a UITableView control to show a list of customers that the user can select from. I've divided this into a number of sections, because the customers they need to select will vary from day to day ¡X so the sections are used to divide between the days. For some reason, there's an excessive amount of whitespace being included in the section header. I don't recall this being the case with iOS 5 (which this application was originally developed with). Can anyone nudge me in the right direction? FWIW, I'm not suppling a heightForHeaderInSection: method, so it's not that trivial. In the titleForHeaderInSection: method I'm returning a simple NSString* which represents the date.
@CODE:UITableView heightForHeaderInSection: titleForHeaderInSection: NSString* [myTableView setTableHeaderView:[[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, [myTableView frame].size.width, 0.01f)]]; [self setAutomaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets:NO]; UITableView

@TITLE:Memory leak in django when keeping a reference of all instances of forms
@CONTENT:This is a followup to this thread. I have implemented the method for keeping a reference to all my forms in a array like mentioned by the selected answer in this but unfortunately I am getting a memory leak on each request to the django host. The code in question is as follows: This is my custom form I am extending which has a function to keep reference of neighboring forms, and whenever I instantiate a new form, it just keeps getting added to the _instances stack. class StepForm(ModelForm):
    TAGS = []
    _instances = []

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = object.__new__(cls)
        cls._instances.append(instance)
        return instance
 Even though this more of a python issue then Django I have decided that it's better to show you the full context that I am encountering this problem at. As requested I am posting what I am trying to accomplish with this feat: I have a js applet with steps, and for each step there is a form, but in order to load the contents of each step dynamically through JS I need to execute some calls on the next form in line. And on the previous aswell. Therefore the only solution I Could come up with is to just keep a reference to all forms on each request and just use the forms functions I need.
@CODE:class StepForm(ModelForm):
    TAGS = []
    _instances = []

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        instance = object.__new__(cls)
        cls._instances.append(instance)

I tried giving (android:alpha="0") but its taking its transparent as white box,but I want to implement as like in the below picture. Is there any property for textView in android. RSMasked label property in android. I didnt find anything in google regarding similiar properties in android.I just likes to know whether any properties in android for achieving this task. Please refer to the Image and the link which I posted. Please suggest me in solving this issue. This is the code used in iOS: #import "RSMaskedLabel.h"

@interface RSMaskedLabel()
- (void) RS_commonInit;
- (void) RS_drawBackgroundInRect:(CGRect)rect;
@end

    // let the superclass draw the label normally
    [super drawRect:rect];

    CGContextConcatCTM(context, CGAffineTransformMake(1, 0, 0, -1, 0, CGRectGetHeight(rect)));

    // create a mask from the normally rendered text

    CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

    [[UIColor whiteColor] set];

if (cell == nil) {

}
 And after that I set it's properties. The cell size is the same as table's heightForRowAtIndexPath: and none of the cells labels or buttons are outside that size. The problem is that I can select the cell, but I can't tap on the buttons. It's as if I'm tapping on a label, nothing happens. So I end up with something like this: EDIT: Just to clarify things. The problem is not the button click methods. It's that I can't physically click the button, like there is something in the way of it, or it's disabled by some control.

@TITLE:How do I transfer a list of genres in SQL to a seperate database
@CONTENT:I have in one database rough 2,000 movies with genres store like this: MOVIE \ ID \ Genre
Avatar \ 1  \ action ^ adventure ^ scifi
matrix \ 2  \ action ^ scifi
 and I was trying to make a system that would sort by genre, and when I researched it I found that I needed a table that would connect the two. (see this question: MySQL select genres problem. (php)) So I know how to implement this, I just dont know how I could transfer the genres into a seperate table. The only way I could come up with is to go row by row and grab the genre column and explode the text, get the array and test for different genres, but that seemed too much of a hassle and difficult to do on 2k+ rows. Thanks!

 The even rows do not possess the hover, but only the odd ones. Require both, even, as well as, odd rows to change their background on mouse-over. The headers should be as they are without any changes.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: send intent from service to activity 1 answer Basically, i have an activity that has a progress dialog, i'm sending a message to an Intent to load all the data from the internet without any hiccup in the application. However, i was able to send a message to the service but i wasn't able to resend the message to the activity. What to do? Here's how i send message to the service: final Handler handler = new Handler() {
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {

    }
};
final Intent intent = new Intent(this, FillingDatabase.class);
final Messenger messenger = new Messenger(handler);
intent.putExtra("messenger", messenger);
startService(intent);
 And here's how i recieve the message from the service: messenger = (Messenger) intent.getParcelableExtra("messenger");
        message = Message.obtain(null, 1234);
            messenger.send(message);
 But i wasnt able to know how to recieve that message in an activity, can someone explain the approach? Thank you!
@CODE:final Handler handler = new Handler() {
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {

    }

intent.putExtra("messenger", messenger);
startService(intent); messenger = (Messenger) intent.getParcelableExtra("messenger");
        message = Message.obtain(null, 1234);

@CONTENT:Am trying to plot spline graph for the no of passed/failed testcases and grouping them based on hour/date/month/year and I am getting this value as irregular series (i.e) if its hours, datas won't be available for all 24 hours. Its the same case for other groupings. As the datas are irregular need the x-axis tick interval to be month vice, Have tried using the dateTimeLabelFormats, It didn't help me much as its only formats the label. All i need is the tickInterval needs to be month vice and both date&time in tooltip. Sorry that i won't be able to post data/fiddle as am using this HighCharts in an BI tool(SpagoBI) and it requires templates. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:I have a search bar and a search display controller with the associated methods implemented. In my xib, I have a text field above this search bar. I want the table view that appears to appear below my search bar and not to cover the search bar or the text field above it. I have tried this: self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 247, 320, 400);
 But this doesn't seem to have any effect. How do I set the UITableView position? OK - with doing this - - (void)searchDisplayController:(UISearchDisplayController *)controller didShowSearchResultsTableView:(UITableView *)tableView {
tableView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 200, 320, 400);
 } The table is appearing below the search bar, but for some reason I cannot click the text field above. I think that is happening because said field is still being covered by the table view and the reason I think this is because when I click on the search bar and begin typing a grey area appears that covers everything.

GroundOverlay imageOverlay = googleMap.addGroundOverlay(newarkMap);
 same thing I tried for activity which shows me circle but for map it showing oval shape not circle shape. How to do this? Need Help. Thank you.

 above code shows the load mask perfectly in console. Below code is the view in which i am manually filtering the users. filterFunction() will run for atleast 4 secs. What could be wrong ? Ext.define('AM.view.main.user', {

@TITLE:Update text file on button click
@CONTENT:I want to make a website where there is a button, and when you click it make it change some text (saying either true/false). The text must change when the user clicks the button, but not just for the one user, for every user that's on the site. The way I'm trying to do it is I have a text file, and so far all I've got is some text on the page that every 500 milliseconds is refreshing to display whatever is in the text file. So now all I need to do is update the text file when the button is clicked. What's the best way I could do this?

@TITLE:How to retrieve partial result in multiple Future wait when some might time-out?
@CONTENT:I am using FUTURE in scala on play framework. But I have difficulty to get part of the final result in case of timeout when merging multiple futures. Here is what my code does. It has two future to query two providers respectively. And then use a for/yield statement to merge the results. And then await for the result with a time out value. It works fine when two providers reply to the query on time. However, if just one provider reply on time, I know the await will timeout but in this case I still need to retrieve the data returned from the other provider which replied on time. How do I do that? val pool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()
implicit val ec = ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(pool)

var future1 = Future(QueryProvider(provider1, request1))  
var future2 = Future(QueryProvider(provider2, request2))  

val future = for {
    result1 <- future1
    result2 <- future2
 } yield (Merge(result1, result2))

 val duration = Duration(60000, MILLISECONDS)

     result = Await.result(future, duration).asInstanceOf[string]

@TITLE:D3Js updating wrong elements using call
@CONTENT:I am new to D3JS and you can find the code at http://jsfiddle.net/3n8wD/ I am a facing an issue and any pointers would help When I move the line it separates as expected, but as soon as I try to move the circles away it jumps back to the line. On inspecting the Array, looks like the circle array is updating as I am moving the link, not sure what is causing that. Any help on this would be highly appreciated. below is the code that i have on jsfiddle var width = 960,
    height = 500;

 It looks like this: The tag patch 9 looks like so: I have 3 questions: How to make the delete icon always on the right. How to make the blurry part of the tag image scale properly? (its a patch 9) Is it better to have a delete icon next to the tag, or use some sort of long click? Thank you.

@TITLE:How to reverse my stopwatch code to count down in Assembler?
@CONTENT:I have written this code for stopwatch in Assembler. If you press button1, it will start counting up. If you press the same button again, it will pause, pressing it once more will resume the stopwatch. Pressing the button number 2 resets the stopwatch. It is quite some time, since I was programming in PicoBlaze Assembler and this is a few years old code and since I did not program for a few years, I have forgotten a lot. But now I need to slightly alter it and I need your help. So what I want now is to have the function of counting down. So when I press button1, it will start counting up, pressing it once more will pause it and once more to resume. But pressing the button2 will start counting it down, same with pausing and resuming with the same button and to move the reset from button2 to a new button3. Can anybody help me with this? Thanks.

@TITLE:Can you do something to the effect of ¡§For each x in jaggedArray () (0)¡¨ in order to compare values of a nested array?
@CONTENT:The purpose of this code is to be able to track multiple properties of undefined "IDs," like name, total time, and occurrences while going through ton of data. As of right now I am using a jagged array to achieve this. idArray = array of all gathered ID's in data idProp = array of properties of each ID I had everything working perfectly till I added the nested array. I need to be able to check while going through the data if the ID is a new or not. with the name of each ID being held in the nested array i can't seem to be able to do this. Here is what i have so far:     For Each ID In idArray()(1) '<-- does not target nested array correctly
            If ID = wbData.Sheets(1).Range("C" & Count) Then
                idPrs = True
            End If
    Next ID
    'adding ID if not present
    If idPrs = False Then
            idCount = idCount + 1
            MsgBox "new ID: " & wbData.Sheets(1).Range("C" & Count) & " on row " & Count
            ReDim Preserve idArray(0 To idCount)
            ReDim idProp(0 To 2)
            'adding starting values
            idProp(0) = wbData.Sheets(1).Range("C" & Count)
            idProp(1) = wbData.Sheets(1).Range("h" & Count)
            idProp(2) = 1
            idList(gidCount) = idProp
            'double array second "()" referrs to second array
            'MsgBox idArray(1)(0)

     End If
 any ideas are welcome, even if they are done a completely different way.

@LINK:/questions/20791621/how-is-package-scope-achieved
@TITLE:How is package scope achieved?
@CONTENT:Meteor documentation (see section Namespacing) says: When you declare a top-level variable, you have a choice. You can make the variable File Scope or Package Scope. // File Scope. This variable will be visible only inside this
// one file. Other files in this app or package won't see it.
var alicePerson = {name: "alice"};

// Package Scope. This variable is visible to every file inside
// of this package or app. The difference is that 'var' is
// omitted.
bobPerson = {name: "bob"};
 This is really nice. If a package has more than one source code file, the files can share variables but keep the rest of the world out. However I started wondering. How the hell do they achieve package scope? At first I thought they achieved it with immediately invoked function expressions. You know constructs like this: (function() { /* your code here */ })();
 So I tried to emulate this behaviour in the console. I define a variable like this: x = "Package scope candidate";. I entered in the console: (function() {
    x = "Package scope candidate";
})();
console.log(x);
 and I get "Package scope candidate" in the console. How disappointing. The variable x landed in the global scope. In the Window object. Absolutely not what I wanted. And Meteor? They managed it somehow. They must have used some magic I don't understand.

@TITLE:Xcode-Instruments cannot run app on simulator with the app target I choose
@CONTENT:I am trying to run an automation on an iOS App using UIAutomation with Instruments. It had worked well when I had tried it out a few weeks back. However, I tried out another automation testing framework (KIF from Square) in the meantime, and now when I try and run Automation with Instruments, it refuses to work. When it had worked, I had carried out the following steps: Open my app in Xcode Run the app Quit the iOS simulator Open Instruments (not necessarily through Xcode, but just by searching for Instruments in Spotlight), choose Automation Instruments opens, and when I click on Choose target, I do not need to browse for the target. I can see the name of my app in the list (description: the app name is without the .app extension and has an icon before the name like the icon which appears at the top of the output window in Xcode - a black and white icon with a gradient) even though I haven¡¦t opened it before i.e even when I had opened Instruments for the first time. I choose this target from the list, choose a javascript file for the automation to run, and then click ¡¥Record¡¦. The automation used to run and I could see it run in the simulator which used to open up. However, opening Instruments no longer shows me the target in the list of targets anymore. I have tried choosing a target from my filesystem (from the Derived Data folder) as well as from the iPhone Simulator applications folder; but no luck. The target does not appear as it used to before (in the description above), but appears with a .app extension and with the typical application icon. The automation does start and open up the simulator, but gives the following message: (although the page or the script haven't changed at all) Cannot perform action on invalid element: UIAElementNil from target.frontMostApp().mainWindow().elements()[2] (Would have liked to post images, but can't, since I am a new user and do not have the required permissions yet - hope the description makes up for it) Have been stuck on this issue for long and any help would be appreciated! Thanks so much!

@TITLE:window.requestAnimationFrame silently fails to invoke callback, but generates a valid requestID, when invoked inside of a cross-domain iframe
@CONTENT:I am developing inside of a Google Chrome Extension. In this environment, I have the ability to inject JavaScript into third-party websites after requesting the appropriate permissions. As such, I am injecting code into an iframe referencing a cross-domain resource, but am not bound by the same cross-origin security policies as would be expected in a 'normal' environment. The code I am executing inside of this iframe is: var requestId = window.requestAnimationFrame(function(){
    console.log("Success");
});
console.log("Request Id:", requestId);
 After this code is executed, my output looks like: Request Id: 1 The callback of requestAnimationFrame is never executed. requestAnimationFrame is defined. The callback works fine if I use a non-optimized call such as setInterval. The callback is executed properly outside of the iframe but no security errors are shown in my console when it fails inside of the iframe. This is only for the latest version of Google Chrome -- do not worry about other implementations of requestAnimationFrame. Are there any steps I can take to debug this issue? window.requestAnimationFrame trails off into native code and my requestId is valid... so I'm at a bit of a loss. EDIT: Here is the full source code for reproducing the issue as a small Google Chrome extension: https://gist.github.com/MeoMix/37b4dbdbb3bd48f3c9e2 Here is a downloadable zip of the source above: https://mega.co.nz/#!2BFA1agY!JSZC1BFBza3rU4LnqlZqcR9neZQRJn0yh1U6tu2GWo4

@TITLE:I want to perform summation on a small and fast qualitative data type in Fortran [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: I want to implement a small and fast qualitative data type in Fortran 1 answer This is part of a series of questions about implementing a qualitative data type in Fortran. Background: The topic relates to something called loop analysis of complex systems which one might read about in, for example, Puccia, C. J. and Levins, R. (1986). Qualitative Modeling of Complex Systems: An Introduction to Loop Analysis and Time Averaging. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, or Levins, R. (1974). The qualitative analysis of partially specified systems. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 231:123¡V138. While I could implement this technique using numerical matrix algebra (as has been done elsewhere), I am interested in approaching the problem from a different direction. The nature of loop analysis is complex and costly (I am not a CS person, but I think it's something like a #P difficulty calculation), and my long term aims are to create a set of libraries for various and sundry loop analysis problems that employ pruning optimizations based on properties of qualitative arithmetic. If this seems hopelessly misguided, please humor me and consider this an exercise in learning. For my purposes the QUALIT data type can have 4 values: -1, 0, 1, and ? (sometimes represented as -, 0, +, and +/-). More about this data type here: I want to implement a small and fast qualitative data type in Fortran I would like QUALIT type data to reflect arithmetic binary operations SUM() and PROD(). Summation of two QUALIT values, A and B works like this: A  B  A+B
-  -   -
-  0   -
-  +   ?
-  ?   ?
0  -   -

+  +   +
+  ?   ?
?  -   ?
?  0   ?
?  +   ?
?  ?   ?
 In array form summation of two QUALITs looks like:        QUALIT 1
      -  0  +  ?

Q -   -  -  ?  ?

A 0   -  0  +  ?

  TYPE(QUALIT)::summation_array(4,4)

  INTEGER::index1, index2
  summation_array(1,1) = QUALIT(.FALSE.,.FALSE.)
  summation_array(1,2) = QUALIT(.FALSE.,.FALSE.)
  summation_array(1,3) = QUALIT(.TRUE., .TRUE.)
  summation_array(1,4) = QUALIT(.TRUE., .TRUE.)
  summation_array(2,1) = QUALIT(.FALSE.,.FALSE.)

  summation_array(4,3) = QUALIT(.TRUE., .TRUE.)
  summation_array(4,4) = QUALIT(.TRUE., .TRUE.)
  xbit1 = x%bit1
  xbit2 = x%bit2
  ybit1 = y%bit1
  ybit2 = y%bit2
  index1 = 1 + (2*COUNT([xbit2])) + COUNT([xbit1])
  index2 = 1 + (2*COUNT([ybit2])) + COUNT([ybit1])
  QUALSUM = summation_array(index1,index2)
  END FUNCTION QUALSUM
 My questions (please answer both): Is the fastest implementation of SUM going to be to declare a static 4*4 array with elements indexed by the first and second input QUALIT values as in my example above? Does the answer to question 1 change if I want to perform these operations on sequences? For example given (pseudocode): TYPE (QUALIT) EXAMPLE :: (/-,+,+,0,+,+,?,+,0,0,-/) Any summation operation across an arbitrary number of operands should return ? as soon as the first ? is encountered (either in the input, or in the current sum total, so after the second element in EXAMPLE we know that the sum of the whole sequence is ?) and cease remaining calculations. I am going to want to perform a large number of such summations, and perform them on large vectors of QUALIT data. Does the answer to this question change when implementing multiplication, rather than summation?

@LINK:/questions/20790234/deleting-a-cell-in-search-bar-table-view-causes-delete-to-be-executed-twice
@TITLE:Deleting a cell in search bar table view causes delete to be executed twice
@CONTENT:I have a table view backed up by core data with NSFetchedResultsController instance. This table has a search bar that displays filtered data. The search bar has a separate NSFetchedResultsController (FRC from now) instance. So far so good, the data is fetched and shown as expected in the table view and also shown correctly in the search bar's table view (when searching for data). My problem is that if I try to delete a cell in the search bar's table view then I get a coredata exception : error: Serious application error. An exception was caught from the delegate of NSFetchedResultsController during a call to -controllerDidChangeContent:. attempt to delete row 0 from section 0 which only contains 0 rows before the update with userInfo (null) Further examination shows that the FRC's controllerWillChangeContent method is called twice on one cell deletion!. This causes deleteRowsAtIndexPaths to be called twice for the same cell (thus the coredata exception). Playing with it some more I have found out that this problem happens from the first time the search bar's table view is shown after a search. (Even when I go back and delete the cell in the regular table view the problem occurs) I've made sure that the deleteRowsAtIndexPaths method is called only once in the code (in the FRC's didChangeObject delegate method). Now I am not sure which code to show so I won't just spill it all. let me know which one you need to look at if you have an idea on what the problem is. This is the code where the table is instructed to delete a row : - (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller didChangeObject:(id)anObject atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)newIndexPath {

    DLog(@"didChangeObject type %lu with object %@", (unsigned long)type, anObject);
    switch(type) {
        case NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert:
            [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:newIndexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            break;

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete:
            [self.tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            break;

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate:
            [self configureCell:[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath] atIndexPath:indexPath forTable:self.tableView];
            break;

        case NSFetchedResultsChangeMove:
            [self.tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray
                                               arrayWithObject:indexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray
                                               arrayWithObject:newIndexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
            break;
    }
}
 This method is called when I save the context after I delete the object for the selected cell. The method where I save the context: - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) {
        [_managedObjectContext deleteObject:[_notesFetcher objectAtIndexPath:indexPath]];
        NSError *error;
        if (![_managedObjectContext save:&error]) {
            DLog(@"Failed deleting object : %@", [error localizedDescription]);
        }
    }

 And for some reason this method is called once but invokes didChangeObject twice with the same change type (2-Delete) for the same cell. UPDATE When I log for the stack trace in the method didChangeObject I get this: [UITableView animateDeletionOfRowWithCell:] + 107 12 UIKit 0x01316a35 -[UITableViewCell _swipeDeleteButtonPushed] + 70 13 libobjc.A.dylib 0x02346874 -[NSObject performSelector:withObject:withObject:] + 77 14 UIKit 0x010a8c8c -[UIApplication sendAction:to:from:forEvent:] + 108 15 UIKit 0x010a8c18 -[UIApplication sendAction:toTarget:fromSender:forEvent:] + 61 16 UIKit 0x011a06d9 -[UIControl sendAction:to:forEvent:] + 66 17 UIKit 0x011a0a9c -[UIControl _sendActionsForEvents:withEvent:] + 577 18 UIKit 0x0119fd4b -[UIControl touchesEnded:withEvent:] + 641 19 UIKit 0x0141ad7f _UIGestureRecognizerUpdate + 7166 20 UIKit 0x010e5d4a -[UIWindow _sendGesturesForEvent:] + 1291 21 UIKit 0x010e6c6a -[UIWindow sendEvent:] + 1030 22 UIKit 0x010baa36 -[UIApplication sendEvent:] + 242 23 UIKit 0x010a4d9f _UIApplicationHandleEventQueue + 11421 As you can see the table's swipeDeleteButtonPushed method is called twice on one delete operation as I described above. How can this be triggered twice when I only pushed the delete button once ? any ideas ?

@TITLE:Add mstsc to shortcut target powershell
@CONTENT:A little background about what I'm trying to do and why. We are slowly migrating from using a local copy of office on our end users Win7 machines to publishing office through RDS 2012. With 2012 you can have the end users machine subscribe to a webfeed which puts the shortcuts to the actual RDP files in Appdata. In order to have our image pretty much mirror before RDS, I need to pin the shortcuts to the taskbar. If you pin the shortcut as it comes from the RDS Gateway server the icon on the taskbar is that of the .rdp file. If you edit the target for the shortcut and put mstsc.exe before the path to the .rdp file you can then pin the shortcut to the taskbar using those icons of the shortcut. I have found posts on how to change the target field of shortcuts but nothing on how to add something to what is currently there. An environment variable is needed since the path to the shorts will be different for each user. Below is I have tried thus far       $Word = $env:userprofile + "\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\RemoteApp and Desktop Connections\Microsoft Word 2010.lnk"

      $sh = New-Object -COM WScript.Shell
      $targetPath = $sh.CreateShortcut($Word).TargetPath
      $sh.TargetPath = "mstsc.exe" + $targetPath ## Make changes
      $sh.Save()  ## Save$shell = New-Object -COM WScript.Shell
 One of the errors i'm getting is : Property 'Arguments' cannot be found on this object; make sure it exists and is settable. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

@CONTENT:In shell script, we have the following command: /script1.pl < input_file| /script2.pl > output_file I would like to replicate the above stream in Python using the module subprocess. input_file is a large file, and I can't read the whole file at once. As such I would like to pass each line, an input_string into the pipe stream and return a string variable output_string, until the whole file has been streamed through.

process.stdin.write(input_string)
output_string = process.communicate()[0]

@TITLE:get value from AJAX request
@CONTENT:This used to be my code: //At "click" I retrieve value from myFunctionA and use it in myFunctionB
$("#myButton").click(function()
{
    var response = myFunctionA();

    if(response) myFunctionB(response);
});

//Inside myFunctionA I perform an AJAX call (you will see it's really and "SJAX")
function myFunctionA()

    return response;
}

//This is not really and AJAX because of the async:false
function myAjax()
{
    var myJSON = {}

    $.ajax({
        url: "some_url.php",
        dataType: "json",
        async: false,
        error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
        {

        {
            myJSON = data;
        }
    });

    return myJSON;
}
 The thing is that the above worked just fine. I request a value, wait for it, and then use it where I needed. Obviously that SJAX part shouldn't be done, I must do a real AJAX request. So while I was looking for a way to achive this I stumbled with questions like jQuery: Return data after ajax call success and really nice answers like http://stackoverflow.com/a/14220323/702353 and also started to read about Deferred and methods like .done(). However I'm not being able to achieve the same result of my original SJAX code. So my questions are: Is it possible to do what I want using an AJAX request? Can it be done without modifying the .click() code? Here is the current code I'm working on $("#myButton").click(function()
{
    var response = myFunctionA();

    if(response) myFunctionB(response);
});

function myFunctionA()
{
    $.when(myAjax()).done(function(response)
    {
        return response;
    });
}

function myAjax()
{
    return $.ajax({
        url: "someurl.php",

        {
            alert(errorThrown);

    });

@TITLE:How to craft links so they are handled by JQuery in document.ready and not global scope
@CONTENT:I recently asked a question here: Previous question and the answer determined that my Javascript function was in Global scope and not found inside the document.ready. I am using VB.NET to build the links that are displayed with some of the code being as follows: sb.Append("<div class=""img-thumbnail"">")
                sb.Append("<a href=""javascript:productPopup('" & Trim(dr.Item("StyleDescription")) & "');"" class=""thumbnail""><img src=""http://placehold.it/100x100"" /></a><h4 class=""thumbnail caption"">" & dr.Item("StyleDescription") & "</h4>")
                sb.Append("<center>" & dr.Item("ststy") & "</center><br />")
                sb.Append("<center>Price: " & FormatCurrency(dr.Item("lowprice"), 2) & " MSRP: " & FormatCurrency(dr.Item("lowMSRP"), 2) & "</center>")
                sb.Append("</div><!-- thumbnail --></div><!-- col-md-2 -->")
 Now I was told that in order to put my function inside of document.ready I should use JQuery to handle the click of the link. My question is this: I am going to need the StyleDescription to be passed to the function so that I can use AJAX to get data out of my database relating to that product. How can I craft the JQuery so that it gets this information correctly regardless of which link is clicked? Thus, let's say I have these links: <a href="javascript:showProductPopup('STY5901');">Green T-Shirt</a>
<a href="javascript:showProductPopup('STY5915');">Red T-Shirt</a>
 How can I convert this to let JQuery handle it and still get the proper StyleDescription value as shown in the above links?
@CODE:sb.Append("<div class=""img-thumbnail"">")
                sb.Append("<a href=""javascript:productPopup('" & Trim(dr.Item("StyleDescription")) & "');"" class=""thumbnail""><img src=""http://placehold.it/100x100"" /></a><h4 class=""thumbnail caption"">" & dr.Item("StyleDescription") & "</h4>")
                sb.Append("<center>" & dr.Item("ststy") & "</center><br />")
                sb.Append("<center>Price: " & FormatCurrency(dr.Item("lowprice"), 2) & " MSRP: " & FormatCurrency(dr.Item("lowMSRP"), 2) & "</center>")
                sb.Append("</div><!-- thumbnail --></div><!-- col-md-2 -->") <a href="javascript:showProductPopup('STY5901');">Green T-Shirt</a>

 Inside my template files I am using static_url() to give proper path to my static files. Because my html files have structure of static files already defined tornado static_url isn't showing correct path. For example, on my server file is having url like <link href="/myflz/resources/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
 and after using static_url it is <link href="/static/myflz/resources/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
 How can I get rid of static before myflz because changing 'static_path': 'static' to 'static_path': 'myflz' doesn't work, it still uses static in front.
@CODE:settings = {
                    'template_path': 'templates',
                    'static_path': 'static'
            } <link href="/myflz/resources/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"/> <link href="/static/myflz/resources/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"/>

 the issue I am facing is that the original form is hidden on load and shown only inside the popover which is actually cloning the form. After the user edit and popover is closed I need to update the original form elements values. I dont know what approach to use. I think it would be best if popover would just move the form inside and place it where it was on close. Seems the shortest way. Any help or idea is appreciated. thank you!

@TITLE:GCM Push Server side, which API Key to use?
@CONTENT:I'm a bit confused. I have a GCM PHP server side app server that uses a key from Google Developer Console. I can create Android key as per the instructions given in getting started guide here, or I can create a browser key, server key or OAuth key. Can somebody tell which key I should use on the server side PHP when sending messages via GCM to Android devices? This is the function that sends the message to GCM     public function send_notification($registatoin_ids, $message) {
    // include config
    include_once './config.php';

    // Set POST variables
    $url = 'https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send';

    $fields = array(
        'registration_ids' => $registatoin_ids,
        'data' => $message,
    );

    $headers = array(
        'Authorization: key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
        'Content-Type: application/json'
    );
    // Open connection
    $ch = curl_init();

    // Set the url, number of POST vars, POST data
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

    // Disabling SSL Certificate support temporarly
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($fields));

    // Execute post
    $result = curl_exec($ch);
    if ($result === FALSE) {
        die('Curl failed: ' . curl_error($ch));
    }

    // Close connection
    curl_close($ch);
    echo $result;
}
 Obviously the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX string is replaced by my API_KEY in the original code. p.s: My android is registering fine with the GCM, I have the registration id sent to server as well, it's the send message post request that always returns 401 Unauthorized, I'm afraid I'm using a wrong key? p.s2: I've tried all 3 sort of API_KEYs without success.
@CODE:public function send_notification($registatoin_ids, $message) {
    // include config
    include_once './config.php';

    // Set POST variables
    $url = 'https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send';

    $fields = array(
        'registration_ids' => $registatoin_ids,
        'data' => $message,
    );

    $headers = array(
        'Authorization: key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
        'Content-Type: application/json'
    );

@CONTENT:This question is an exact duplicate of: How to use indexes for a query filtering BETWEEN two columns 2 answers Need a generic sql query for joins that can run on mysql, postgres and other major DBs I have a table named autumn4.ip , I have three columns: id,start,end (all ints). How do I make a join so that I make use of BUT not by BETWEEN but by JOINS. like pseudo: select * FROM autumn.ip WHERE :number-constant >= start ORDER BY start DESC LIMIT 1; +

select * FROM autumn.ip WHERE :number-constant <= end ORDER BY start ASC LIMIT 1;
 how to some one join the above two queries to get one row of data that would be equivalent to SELECT * FROM autumn4.ip WHERE :number-constant BETWEEN START AND END LIMIT 1;
 Just dont ask my why I am doing it :) but I know you woudl so: I am trying to accomplish is to use 2 indexes, start and end. if i use BETWEEN and/or a composite index of start,end. Only start index is used and not the end. now please dont tell me that I am wrong. I just want it that way. I have done alot of research on this if i do create single indexes for both start and end, only one is used. give me a query in which both are used
@CODE:three columns: id,start,end (all ints). select * FROM autumn.ip WHERE :number-constant >= start ORDER BY start DESC LIMIT 1; +

select * FROM autumn.ip WHERE :number-constant <= end ORDER BY start ASC LIMIT 1; SELECT * FROM autumn4.ip WHERE :number-constant BETWEEN START AND END LIMIT 1; autumn4.ip.number LIMIT 1 UNION

@TITLE:Excluding domains from content_scripts in manifest.json doesn't work for CSS files?
@CONTENT:I want to write a chrome extension to force all websites to use given CSS style except Gmail page. However the following code from content scripts in manifest.json doesn't work (Gmail page will still use the style given in font.css). "content_scripts":  [{
    "matches":  ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"],
    "exclude_matches": ["*://mail.google.com/*"],
    "css":  ["font.css"]
}]
 This cannot be fixed even adopting the strategy advised here by replacing exclude_matches with exclude_globs. I know this bug existing for a while, so-called Bug #100106. Any idea on how to fix this? Or are there any alternative ways I can use to achieve my goal?

@TITLE:Get the redirected URL of a very specific URL (in Java)
@CONTENT:How can I get the redirected URL of http://at.atwola.com/?adlink/5113/1649059/0/2018/AdId=4041444;BnId=872;itime=15692006;impref=13880156912668385284; in Java?

@LINK:/questions/20783629/php-soap-server-method-receive-a-set-of-parameters
@TITLE:PHP SOAP Server method receive a set of parameters
@CONTENT:I have setup a SOAP Server with php. The problem is that, as per the WSDL, the client which calls the server method, is supposed to pass a set of parameters (more than 50). I got to know this from SOAP UI. But how do i handle all those parameters in my Server method? Should i go on and declare each and every parameter for my Server method, as below? public function addMessage($a, $b, $c, $d, .................) {

}
 But I hope there must be a simpler approach to this. Preferably, i would like to receive all parameters in my Server method, as an array or object. UPDATE: I am using Zend_Soap_Server. Do i need to define any complex types, for handling input parameters? As i see, the WSDL defines few complex types.
@CODE:public function addMessage($a, $b, $c, $d, .................) {

@TITLE:PHP SOAP Server method receive a set of parameters
@CONTENT:I have setup a SOAP Server with php. The problem is that, as per the WSDL, the client which calls the server method, is supposed to pass a set of parameters (more than 50). I got to know this from SOAP UI. But how do i handle all those parameters in my Server method? Should i go on and declare each and every parameter for my Server method, as below? public function addMessage($a, $b, $c, $d, .................) {

}
 But I hope there must be a simpler approach to this. Preferably, i would like to receive all parameters in my Server method, as an array or object. UPDATE: I am using Zend_Soap_Server. Do i need to define any complex types, for handling input parameters? As i see, the WSDL defines few complex types.

@TITLE:Displaying values from multiple JavaScript slider values
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how to get multiple sliders to display their values to the right hand side, based on an example I found: http://webtutsdepot.com/2010/04/24/html-5-slider-input-tutorial/ (I then want to store each slider output as a JavaScript variable to use as an input to several functions, but first thing's first.) I added an input id and name to each of the sliders (from http://html5tutorial.info/html5-range.php) as well as a form name and id (http://www.javascript-coder.com/javascript-form/getelementbyid-form.phtml) ... but I can't seem to modify the example function ( which uses document.getElementById("range").innerHTML ) to get the value to display for one of the sliders. Thus, in their present state, all slider values reflect the 1st slider's position as opposed to the other ones. I've tried playing around with for a while, but have not made much progress beyond adding possible identifiers that I can't grab :-p. Can anyone explain how I can target display slider values by their name or input id instead of input type? Or point me to a resource that could show me how to modify what I have now? That way I could have each slider display a value for its own position. I have the sliders in my header. Code is pasted below (I've left it so that the code runs, but each number displays the first slider's position): <p>   
<form name = "weight1" id = "weight1" >
<!-- http://webtutsdepot.com/2010/04/24/html-5-slider-input-tutorial/ -->
    <text><b> weight1 </b></text> <input id="weight1" input type="range" name="weight1" min="0" max="100" value="0" step="1" onchange="showValue(weight1.value)" />
    <span id="range">0</span>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    function showValue(newValue)
    {
        document.getElementById("range").innerHTML=newValue;
    }
    </script>
</form>

<form name = "weight2" id = "weight2" >
    <text><b> weight2 </b></text> <input id="weight2" input type="range" name="weight2" min="0" max="100" value="0" step="1" onchange="showValue(weight2.value)" />
    <span id="range">0</span>
</form>

    <span id="range">0</span>
</form>

<form name = "weight4" id = "weight4" >
    <text><b> weight4 </b></text> <input id="weight4" input type="range" name="weight4" min="0" max="100" value="0" step="1" onchange="showValue(this.value)" />
    <span id="range">0</span>
</form>

<form name = "weight5" id = "weight5" >
    <text><b> weight5 </b></text> <input id="weight5" input type="range" name="weight5" min="0" max="100" value="0" step="1" onchange="showValue(this.value)" />
    <span id="range">0</span>
</form>

<form name = "weight6" id = "weight6" >
    <text><b> weight6 </b></text> <input id="weight6" input type="range" name="weight6" min="0" max="100" value="0" step="1" onchange="showValue(this.value)" />
    <span id="range">0</span>
</form>
</p> 
 (note: I abandoned renaming the showValue(this.value) when I realized it didn't work as a unique identifier...) Presumably, once I know how to grab a JavaScript slider value to display, I can use that same sort of technique to assign it to a variable to use it in the body of my HTML document... Any insight would be much appreciated!

@TITLE:html canvas trap left click and allow right click to pass through (pointer-events)
@CONTENT:The use case is that I have an html canvas on top of several html elements which listen for right click mouse events. I want to draw on the canvas using left mouse button, and at the same time interact with underlying html elements using right click. I get that I can allow all mouse events to pass through the canvas by setting css property pointer-events to none. However I want to allow only right click to pass through it. One way to achieve this may be to listen on the canvas for right click, set pointer-events to none in the callback, manually fire a right click event again and set pointer-events back to auto. Btw I'm using KineticsJS and I have no idea how to manually fire mouse events using it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

@CONTENT:i'm trying to test the very simple directive i have made. .directive('cssnotification', [ '$timeout', function($timeout) {

        scope.$watch('success',function(newVal ,oldVal){

            }
        },true)
    }  
}
 }])
 This directive makes some element to be visible for 1 second and after that - fades it out. (here is the fiddle that demonstrates the problem) I know that for perform the fadingOut animation angular should add "ng-hide-add" class to the element, and that is that i'm trying to test. In the browser it works (remove angular-mocks from fiddler and it will run) but in unit tests - this test fails for some reason. I guess it has something to do with injecting of ng-animate... Thanks forwards

@TITLE:HTTP 404 when trying to run a jsp file in eclipse
@CONTENT:I get 404 error when trying to run a jsp file eclipse. The confusing thing is the server is running and I can go to localhost:8080 without any problems. I have attached an image of my configuration of server, the jsp file and also the location of the file and the error. I embed the image cause of the reputation thing so I have linked it More information: I am using TOMCAT 7, ECLIPSE KEPLER I have checked the location of helloworld.jsp its in WebContent. I have restarted the server. I have created another dynamic web project nothing works. I get the same problem I can go to localhost:8080 but I cant run an JSP file SOLVED: Okay guys its pretty simple to solve this problem. There are two things you need to try. 1)Right click your project and export the war file into C:\ProgramFiles\Tomcat7 folder If this does not work then. 2) Right click your project and export the war file into some directory and copy the war file into C:\ProgramFiles\Tomcat7 then start the Tomcat server and there you go your JSP file work. You will probably end up doing step 2 because of stupid windows file permissions Also thanks for all the help guys really appreciate it.

@TITLE:SQLite: Column 'date' does not belong to table
@CONTENT:I have a SQLite Database with following columns: _id, displayName, date Using following csharp code i am trying to Select rows in Sqlite Database, it works for all columns but the date!:     try
    {
    SQLiteConnection mDBConnection = 
    new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=C:\\Users\\x86\\Desktop\\db forms\\instances.db");
        mDBConnection.Open();

        SQLiteDataReader reader = mycommand.ExecuteReader();
        dt.Load(reader);
        reader.Close();
        mDBConnection.Close();

        foreach(DataRow row in dt.Rows){
           string id = row["_id"].ToString();
           string displayName = row["displayName"].ToString();
           DateTime date = (DateTime)row["date"]; //Error Here: Column 'date' does not belong to table instances.
           string datefromDb = row["date"].ToString(); // Same Error with this line...

 I get this error: Column 'date' does not belong to table instances. The column 'date' actually does exists in the database. If i don't wrap date column in datetime(...) it gives "String was not recognized as a valid DateTime" at dt.Load(reader); UPDATE: This is the database ... its columns and types. Date Data Inside Database.
@CODE:try
    {
    SQLiteConnection mDBConnection =

@TITLE:how to reduce image file size in python?
@CONTENT:So I looked at this question and got the following code from it: import Image, ImageFile  
pic = pic/goes/here.jpg
im = Image.open(pic)
width, height = im.size
if width > 1000 or height > 1000:
    width = width*.7
    height = height*.7
im = im.resize((int(math.floor(width)), int(math.floor(height))), Image.ANTIALIAS)
try:
    im.save(pic,optimize=True,quality=80)
except IOError:
    ImageFile.MAXBLOCK = width * height
    im.save(pic,optimize=True,quality=80)
 The last bit at the end came from this question as I noticed PIL just kind of gave up when the file exceeded around 1500~ px in size (I have no clue why?) The problem is that when I run this code with a roughly 2500x1600 image PIL either gives me an image thats the same size (1.2MB) or an empty file with 0 MB. I once even got a file that was bigger!?!? (1.38MB) So what am I doing wrong? I just want to optimize the image to as small of a file size without losing about 80% quality. Also any other ways to reduce the file size in python? Thanks!!

 For a white image (255, 255, 255) I get 0 and 32 back as the 2 values...? I don't know if this is correct and I'm just interpreting them wrong or if they're just completely wrong. (not true anymore with updated code) EDIT: With the updated code I'm getting 8192 for a 255 value and 1768 for a 128 value. This still doesn't make much sense to me... I was also wondering if I should be using the "using" statement when loading the image, because http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z7ha67kw says I need to keep the stream open for the lifetime of the bitmap. It seems to work fine the way it is now, or is that because I copy the bitmap to another bitmap declared outside the "using" statement?
@CODE:static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Bitmap bmp;
    using (Stream imageStreamSource = new FileStream(bitmapPath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))   //Should I use "using" here? or do I need to keep the stream open for as long as I use the Bitmap?
    {
        PngBitmapDecoder decoder = new PngBitmapDecoder(imageStreamSource, BitmapCreateOptions.PreservePixelFormat, BitmapCacheOption.Default);
        BitmapSource bitmapSource = decoder.Frames[0];
        bmp = _bitmapFromSource(bitmapSource);
    }

    unsafe
    {
        int xIncr = Image.GetPixelFormatSize(bmp.PixelFormat) / 8;      //8
        xIncr /= 2;

        BitmapData bData1 = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadWrite, bmp.PixelFormat);

        ushort* bData1Scan0Ptr = (ushort*)bData1.Scan0.ToPointer();
        ushort* nextBase = bData1Scan0Ptr + bData1.Stride;

        for (int y = 0; y < bData1.Height; ++y)
        {
            for (int x = 0; x < bData1.Width; ++x)
            {
                var red = bData1Scan0Ptr[2];
                var green = bData1Scan0Ptr[1];
                var blue = bData1Scan0Ptr[0];

                bData1Scan0Ptr += xIncr;      //xIncr = 4
            }

            bData1Scan0Ptr = nextBase;
            nextBase += bData1.Stride;
        }
    }

@TITLE:How to circle/highlight/rectangle certain regions of an image?
@CONTENT:I have a grayscale image with various regions that need to be circled in a WPF C# program. An example of such an image would be this: The regions I'm looking to circle are the white ones, in this manner: So far what I'm trying to do is make an array of bytes, consisting of the intensity of each pixel (0 being black and white being 4000 and upwards.) I then pass each byte through a threshold test to see if its a pixel with part of the region in it or not (for example, if bytes have lengths beyond 3500, consider it as part of the region, else it's not.) I am stumped as what to do after this. So far one of my ideas is to find the first pixel of a region within a row, then find the last pixel of a region of row on the bottom of a region (so top left and bottom right.) Then I'd find the distance in between both pixels and use that to get the center point (from which I could use to get the coordinates needed to draw circle.) Issues with this method I think would be noise that would either cause many circles to appear on the image or misinformed circles. I guess I could use thresholds to eliminate small circles though. These images are actually frames of a video (information is obtained as a byte array and then written to a WriteableBitmap) , so I don't know if too many manipulations with the data would lag the footage. I'm also a newbie with C#, bytes and CS in general, but this project is something I took up during my winter break to learn how to program. Any answers or resources would be much appreciated, especially in pseudocode or C#.

@LINK:/questions/20778090/how-exactly-is-assisted-inject-suppose-to-be-use-to-be-useful
@TITLE:How exactly is Assisted-inject suppose to be use to be useful?
@CONTENT:I'm currently using Guice in my App. However i find myself mostly using assisted inject because there is a chain of injected objects that all depend on what was the input of the program. Hence almost everything is assisted inject. For instance A need B who need c who need Z which needs input from the command line. In the end i feel like everything will be assisted injected. So given that i'm stuck with it i want to be sure that i m using it right. I personally feel like writing my own factories would be as good. Moreover, in addition to the same advantage i could further limit the creation of my objects in question to these factories. Hence my question here is, how useful is it really to use assisted inject, is it only the idea of having things assisted and non assisted as the same time? What if like in my case you have only have assisted parameters? Their must be some gain at organizing it with assisted injection. I just don't see it. If anyone could enlighten me here, i would greatly i appreciate, Many thanks PS: My dependency is as such: I have an InfrastructureService, which require a KnowledgeBaseService which in turn require an ConFigDataObject. My configDataObject contains information coming from the inputs of the program. The configDataObject store these information after doing some validation and processing on those inputs. For instance a string representing file path can be provided to it, and it will validate that it is file that exist, and have a getter method that return that File to its consumer. Other things might be URLNname to real URL Object, and so on. The important point here is this following graph: InfrastructureService -> KnowledgeBaseService -> ConFigDataObject -> InputData Therefore the InfrastructureService can only work with a knowledgeBaseService that is started with the right inputFile, URL, workingfolder and etc.... which is provided to it with a configDataObject, that receive them from the input of the program and store a processed version of them. Therefore as of now what i do is to have a assistedFactory to create the knowledgeBaseService. It takes as parameter the ConfigDataObject. The configDataObject is created with a factoryMethod (Scala Companion Object). Finally, the an assistedFactory is also create for the InfrastructureService which takes as parameter for its creation method a KnowledgeBaseService. As you can guess everything is pretty much created upfront, and somehow manually. I find it odd.

@CONTENT:I'm developing an Mobile App that is integrated with Facebook. So far I've only developed the Android version. The app sends notifications to users so they can confirm their presence on soccer matches. When a user clicks on the notification using a desktop version of the facebook everything goes fine, the facebook canvas page sends a post request with a signed_request.

@TITLE:gcc optimising away compound statement
@CONTENT:I am having an issue with implementing a push_back operator for a generic resizable vector in c. For genericity I need to use a void pointer as an argument, but in practice I want to give it values directly. When I compile the below code with gcc -o t test.c -std=c99, it prints 10 as I expect. When I add -O1 (or higher) to the compile options, the program prints 0. I think the problem is in the smemcpy code, as when I replace it with memcpy I no longer have this problem. Simplified code: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define get_pointer(value) ({ __typeof__(value) tmp = value; &tmp; })

// copy from src to dst byte by byte
void* smemcpy(void* dst, void const * src, size_t len) {
    char * pdst = (char *) dst;
    char const * psrc = (char const *) src;

    while (len--) {
        *pdst++ = *psrc++;
    }

    return (dst);
}


int main() {
    void* container = malloc(sizeof(int));

    // copy a 10 into the container via a temporary pointer
    smemcpy(container, get_pointer(10), sizeof(int));

    printf("%d\n", ((int*)container)[0]);

    return 0;
}

 I'm connecting via telnet and typing like this: So I assume that packet sending by telnet client has no specific headers and pass to low level protocol (TCP in my case) completely without changing. Is it correct?

@TITLE:Multiple, configurable widgets - update issue
@CONTENT:When I'm adding single widget I can configure it properly and it's updated as supposed to after initial configuration. But when I add second and next instances of widget with the same or different configuration onUpdate is not triggered. Well, to be specific onUpdate is executed just before Configuration is set, when Configuration Activity is on top, so it works like: 1 widget - OK 2 widgets - First OK, Second not updated 3 widgets - First OK, Second OK, Third not updated and so on. Behavior tested on Android 4.3. I've no idea why update is not working as supposed to. "OK" Button in Configuration Activity (straight from: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html#Configuring):  public void ok(View v){

     setResult(RESULT_OK, resultValue);  
     saveSettings();
     finish();  
 }
 OnUpdate part in Widget Provider: ComponentName thisWidget = new ComponentName(context, MyWidget.class);
        int[] allWidgetIds = appWidgetManager.getAppWidgetIds(thisWidget);
        for (int widgetId : allWidgetIds) {

@TITLE:JavaScript: Swipe for Action Pattern Implementation
@CONTENT:I have implemented the Swipe for Action Android pattern in my mobile web application (PhoneGap) using JavaScript & CSS animations/transitions. However, there's one thing that's still eluding me. I wish, that once the action menu is displayed fully and the user clicks anywhere outside of the action menu (labelled 3 in the figure), the menu should retract and the original item displayed (labelled 1 in the figure). In a desktop application, one could "capture focus" and perform the transition back to (1) in lostfocus. What is the JS equivalent of lostfocus event. I see an onfocus and onblur event, but from what I read it's really meant for things that need focus; like input, textarea, etc. How else could I catch that event I'm interested in, other than putting some code in the touchend of every other element in the page and forcing the retraction of open actions explicitly?

But for some reason if timer is cancelled either manually or because of error does onFinish() get called? Or it just cancels the timer without calling any method. Here are My two Counters. Counter1:     class Counter1 extends CountDownTimer {

    public Counter1(long millisInFuture, long countDownInterval) {
        super(millisInFuture, countDownInterval);
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub

        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        Log.d(TAG, " Timer1 Finished");
                    //Add 2min to second timer


    }

    @Override
    public void onTick(long millisUntilFinished) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

@TITLE:Displaying values from multiple JavaScript slider values
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out how to get multiple sliders to display their values to the right hand side, based on an example I found: http://webtutsdepot.com/2010/04/24/html-5-slider-input-tutorial/ (I then want to store each slider output as a JavaScript variable to use as an input to several functions, but first thing's first.) I added an input id and name to each of the sliders (from http://html5tutorial.info/html5-range.php) as well as a form name and id (http://www.javascript-coder.com/javascript-form/getelementbyid-form.phtml) ... but I can't seem to modify the example function ( which uses document.getElementById("range").innerHTML ) to get the value to display for one of the sliders. Thus, in their present state, all slider values reflect the 1st slider's position as opposed to the other ones. I've tried playing around with for a while, but have not made much progress beyond adding possible identifiers that I can't grab :-p. Can anyone explain how I can target display slider values by their name or input id instead of input type? Or point me to a resource that could show me how to modify what I have now? That way I could have each slider display a value for its own position. I have the sliders in my header. Code is pasted below (I've left it so that the code runs, but each number displays the first slider's position): <p>

</p> 
 (note: I abandoned renaming the showValue(this.value) when I realized it didn't work as a unique identifier...)

Any insight would be much appreciated!

@CONTENT:The use case is that I have an html canvas on top of several html elements which listen for right click mouse events. I want to draw on the canvas using left mouse button, and at the same time interact with underlying html elements using right click. I get that I can allow all mouse events to pass through the canvas by setting css property pointer-events to none. However I want to allow only right click to pass through it. One way to achieve this may be to listen on the canvas for right click, set pointer-events to none in the callback, manually fire a right click event again and set pointer-events back to auto. Btw I'm using KineticsJS and I have no idea how to manually fire mouse events using it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 This directive makes some element to be visible for 1 second and after that - fades it out. (here is the fiddle that demonstrates the problem) I know that for perform the fadingOut animation angular should add "ng-hide-add" class to the element, and that is that i'm trying to test. In the browser it works (remove angular-mocks from fiddler and it will run) but in unit tests - this test fails for some reason. I guess it has something to do with injecting of ng-animate...

@CONTENT:I get 404 error when trying to run a jsp file eclipse. The confusing thing is the server is running and I can go to localhost:8080 without any problems. I have attached an image of my configuration of server, the jsp file and also the location of the file and the error. I embed the image cause of the reputation thing so I have linked it More information: I am using TOMCAT 7, ECLIPSE KEPLER I have checked the location of helloworld.jsp its in WebContent. I have restarted the server. I have created another dynamic web project nothing works. I get the same problem I can go to localhost:8080 but I cant run an JSP file SOLVED: Okay guys its pretty simple to solve this problem. There are two things you need to try. 1)Right click your project and export the war file into C:\ProgramFiles\Tomcat7 folder If this does not work then. 2) Right click your project and export the war file into some directory and copy the war file into C:\ProgramFiles\Tomcat7 then start the Tomcat server and there you go your JSP file work. You will probably end up doing step 2 because of stupid windows file permissions Also thanks for all the help guys really appreciate it.

@TITLE:static library with core data (Cannot archive)
@CONTENT:After making a static library to handle the core data related code for my app, and making the bundle needed to be able to have the static library access the (core data) database. I finally have everything working when testing on my device. Unfortunately when I want to Product/Archive the app (to make an IPA file) it does not work. Here is what I get in the debugger: CpResource /Users/neptune/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Factorial-ekduhgrmnbgyteaokxccduhudcno/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/Factorial/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/CoreDataResource.bundle /Users/neptune/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Factorial-ekduhgrmnbgyteaokxccduhudcno/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/Factorial/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/Factorial.app/CoreDataResource.bundle cd /Users/neptune/Documents/Factorial setenv PATH "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" builtin-copy -exclude .DS_Store -exclude CVS -exclude .svn -exclude .git -exclude .hg -strip-debug-symbols -strip-tool /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/strip -resolve-src-symlinks /Users/neptune/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Factorial-ekduhgrmnbgyteaokxccduhudcno/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/Factorial/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/CoreDataResource.bundle /Users/neptune/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Factorial-ekduhgrmnbgyteaokxccduhudcno/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/Factorial/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/Factorial.app error: /Users/neptune/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Factorial-ekduhgrmnbgyteaokxccduhudcno/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/Factorial/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/CoreDataResource.bundle: No such file or directory I have tried everything I could think about, but up to this point with no success. This is my first time to use a bundle inside my app, so I might well be missing some basic point. Any relevant tip, by anyone with similar or more experience, will be very much appreciated.

@TITLE:how to reduce image file size in python?
@CONTENT:So I looked at this question and got the following code from it: import Image, ImageFile  
pic = pic/goes/here.jpg
im = Image.open(pic)
width, height = im.size
if width > 1000 or height > 1000:
    width = width*.7
    height = height*.7
im = im.resize((int(math.floor(width)), int(math.floor(height))), Image.ANTIALIAS)
try:
    im.save(pic,optimize=True,quality=80)
except IOError:
    ImageFile.MAXBLOCK = width * height
    im.save(pic,optimize=True,quality=80)
 The last bit at the end came from this question as I noticed PIL just kind of gave up when the file exceeded around 1500~ px in size (I have no clue why?) The problem is that when I run this code with a roughly 2500x1600 image PIL either gives me an image thats the same size (1.2MB) or an empty file with 0 MB. I once even got a file that was bigger!?!? (1.38MB) So what am I doing wrong? I just want to optimize the image to as small of a file size without losing about 80% quality. Also any other ways to reduce the file size in python? Thanks!!

 For a white image (255, 255, 255) I get 0 and 32 back as the 2 values...? I don't know if this is correct and I'm just interpreting them wrong or if they're just completely wrong. (not true anymore with updated code) EDIT: With the updated code I'm getting 8192 for a 255 value and 1768 for a 128 value. This still doesn't make much sense to me... I was also wondering if I should be using the "using" statement when loading the image, because http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z7ha67kw says I need to keep the stream open for the lifetime of the bitmap. It seems to work fine the way it is now, or is that because I copy the bitmap to another bitmap declared outside the "using" statement?

@TITLE:How to circle/highlight/rectangle certain regions of an image?
@CONTENT:I have a grayscale image with various regions that need to be circled in a WPF C# program. An example of such an image would be this: The regions I'm looking to circle are the white ones, in this manner: So far what I'm trying to do is make an array of bytes, consisting of the intensity of each pixel (0 being black and white being 4000 and upwards.) I then pass each byte through a threshold test to see if its a pixel with part of the region in it or not (for example, if bytes have lengths beyond 3500, consider it as part of the region, else it's not.) I am stumped as what to do after this. So far one of my ideas is to find the first pixel of a region within a row, then find the last pixel of a region of row on the bottom of a region (so top left and bottom right.) Then I'd find the distance in between both pixels and use that to get the center point (from which I could use to get the coordinates needed to draw circle.) Issues with this method I think would be noise that would either cause many circles to appear on the image or misinformed circles. I guess I could use thresholds to eliminate small circles though. These images are actually frames of a video (information is obtained as a byte array and then written to a WriteableBitmap) , so I don't know if too many manipulations with the data would lag the footage. I'm also a newbie with C#, bytes and CS in general, but this project is something I took up during my winter break to learn how to program. Any answers or resources would be much appreciated, especially in pseudocode or C#.

@LINK:/questions/20778090/how-exactly-is-assisted-inject-suppose-to-be-use-to-be-useful
@TITLE:How exactly is Assisted-inject suppose to be use to be useful?
@CONTENT:I'm currently using Guice in my App. However i find myself mostly using assisted inject because there is a chain of injected objects that all depend on what was the input of the program. Hence almost everything is assisted inject. For instance A need B who need c who need Z which needs input from the command line. In the end i feel like everything will be assisted injected. So given that i'm stuck with it i want to be sure that i m using it right. I personally feel like writing my own factories would be as good. Moreover, in addition to the same advantage i could further limit the creation of my objects in question to these factories. Hence my question here is, how useful is it really to use assisted inject, is it only the idea of having things assisted and non assisted as the same time? What if like in my case you have only have assisted parameters? Their must be some gain at organizing it with assisted injection. I just don't see it. If anyone could enlighten me here, i would greatly i appreciate, Many thanks PS: My dependency is as such: I have an InfrastructureService, which require a KnowledgeBaseService which in turn require an ConFigDataObject. My configDataObject contains information coming from the inputs of the program. The configDataObject store these information after doing some validation and processing on those inputs. For instance a string representing file path can be provided to it, and it will validate that it is file that exist, and have a getter method that return that File to its consumer. Other things might be URLNname to real URL Object, and so on. The important point here is this following graph: InfrastructureService -> KnowledgeBaseService -> ConFigDataObject -> InputData Therefore the InfrastructureService can only work with a knowledgeBaseService that is started with the right inputFile, URL, workingfolder and etc.... which is provided to it with a configDataObject, that receive them from the input of the program and store a processed version of them. Therefore as of now what i do is to have a assistedFactory to create the knowledgeBaseService. It takes as parameter the ConfigDataObject. The configDataObject is created with a factoryMethod (Scala Companion Object). Finally, the an assistedFactory is also create for the InfrastructureService which takes as parameter for its creation method a KnowledgeBaseService. As you can guess everything is pretty much created upfront, and somehow manually. I find it odd.

@TITLE:Facebook Notification - What is the code parameter on the URL
@CONTENT:I'm developing an Mobile App that is integrated with Facebook. So far I've only developed the Android version. The app sends notifications to users so they can confirm their presence on soccer matches. When a user clicks on the notification using a desktop version of the facebook everything goes fine, the facebook canvas page sends a post request with a signed_request. But on the iOS version, since I don't have the app yet, the user is redirected to the following url: [my canvas web url]?ref=notif&code=AQD6fUp8oAvz9pDD1ygEfoaXW6ls3jEyhPsBmZP-nXrhQw67U0BBqZXJPa6MDyJu1_kSuUYjFPP-RtGRvdv7iyADlJavuZqqDsnNF7AAfDSatopNQEeBqplEUhhDXVDZcUSBFjZFcEmhwdboPliFE5jbjk4PyJY1_vOaE4b4UAbs11pOJXGRq2RU_mJUC2GPzBT63W-aewc60bHTiXrMzgzI_Da3Sp0mlAa7SQn1rF-co2Au-BDDGpV694bOmC5PtJBpIJTU_FO_bwl-vb3bDeQOp-XRLe8_K3JP3hQhutcFy7jeSySP0D2dhVDPgwUn9u8&fb_source=notification&request_ids=196632097193420&app_request_type=user_to_user#_= I don't know how to parse this url, and it doesn't have a signed request. I've googled a little bit and found out that this code querystring parameter can be used to get an access token (when building login), but I need a redirect_uri. I don't know what I can do with this URL to get what user this is about.

@TITLE:gcc optimising away compound statement
@CONTENT:I am having an issue with implementing a push_back operator for a generic resizable vector in c. For genericity I need to use a void pointer as an argument, but in practice I want to give it values directly. When I compile the below code with gcc -o t test.c -std=c99, it prints 10 as I expect. When I add -O1 (or higher) to the compile options, the program prints 0. I think the problem is in the smemcpy code, as when I replace it with memcpy I no longer have this problem. Simplified code: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define get_pointer(value) ({ __typeof__(value) tmp = value; &tmp; })

// copy from src to dst byte by byte
void* smemcpy(void* dst, void const * src, size_t len) {
    char * pdst = (char *) dst;
    char const * psrc = (char const *) src;

    while (len--) {
        *pdst++ = *psrc++;
    }

    return (dst);
}


int main() {
    void* container = malloc(sizeof(int));

    // copy a 10 into the container via a temporary pointer
    smemcpy(container, get_pointer(10), sizeof(int));

    printf("%d\n", ((int*)container)[0]);

@TITLE:Multiple Redirect page that would display a message before, is this the best method?
@CONTENT:I have a website with about 50 pages, each one have a text link and a banner link, I want them to lead to the same redirect page, that would redirect them to an external URL, according to two variables that would be in these banner/text link. a banner link would be something like: http://mydomain.com/redirect.php?dest=2&source=banner
 Here's a code that seems to be working, I'm not a programmer so I've just compiled patches from here and there. <!doctype html>
<?php

$id = $_GET['source']; // user would get to this page with an "id" that would be according to the link he clicked, either text or banner; this "id" info needs to be passed on to the external page as well, with the following "?referal" tag.

if(isset($_GET['dest'])); // user would get to this page from one of about 50 different pages; his redirect destination would depened on the "dest" number of the link he clicked

switch ($_GET['dest']) {

    case "1":
        $url = "http://url1.com/?referal=$id";
        break;

 I want to know - Is this the optimal code for the purpose? also, Is it possible to make the redirect with PHP instead of META, even though I want the page to display some data?

@LINK:/questions/20776449/multiple-configurable-widgets-update-issue
@TITLE:Multiple, configurable widgets - update issue
@CONTENT:When I'm adding single widget I can configure it properly and it's updated as supposed to after initial configuration. But when I add second and next instances of widget with the same or different configuration onUpdate is not triggered. Well, to be specific onUpdate is executed just before Configuration is set, when Configuration Activity is on top, so it works like: 1 widget - OK 2 widgets - First OK, Second not updated 3 widgets - First OK, Second OK, Third not updated and so on. Behavior tested on Android 4.3. I've no idea why update is not working as supposed to. "OK" Button in Configuration Activity (straight from: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html#Configuring):  public void ok(View v){

     Intent intent = getIntent();
     Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
     if (extras != null) {
         mAppWidgetId = extras.getInt(
                 AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, 
                 AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID);
     }

     AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager = AppWidgetManager.getInstance(this);
     RemoteViews views = new RemoteViews(getPackageName(), R.layout.widget_lay);
     appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(mAppWidgetId, views);

     Log.e("mAppWidgetId", "id: "+mAppWidgetId);

     Intent resultValue = new Intent();  
     resultValue.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, mAppWidgetId);  
     setResult(RESULT_OK, resultValue);  
     saveSettings();
     finish();  
 }
 OnUpdate part in Widget Provider: ComponentName thisWidget = new ComponentName(context, MyWidget.class);
        int[] allWidgetIds = appWidgetManager.getAppWidgetIds(thisWidget);
        for (int widgetId : allWidgetIds) {
            SharedPreferences settings = context.getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, 0);
            int myConfig = settings.getInt("myConfig"+widgetId, -1);
            if(myConfig != -1){
                Log.d("widget id", widgetId+" ");
                updateWidget(db, widgetId, myConfig);
            }

@TITLE:JavaScript: Swipe for Action Pattern Implementation
@CONTENT:I have implemented the Swipe for Action Android pattern in my mobile web application (PhoneGap) using JavaScript & CSS animations/transitions. However, there's one thing that's still eluding me. I wish, that once the action menu is displayed fully and the user clicks anywhere outside of the action menu (labelled 3 in the figure), the menu should retract and the original item displayed (labelled 1 in the figure). In a desktop application, one could "capture focus" and perform the transition back to (1) in lostfocus. What is the JS equivalent of lostfocus event. I see an onfocus and onblur event, but from what I read it's really meant for things that need focus; like input, textarea, etc. How else could I catch that event I'm interested in, other than putting some code in the touchend of every other element in the page and forcing the retraction of open actions explicitly?

@TITLE:Tapping text input field on iPhone brings up keyboard, but typing will not put in any text
@CONTENT:I'm working on making a page more responsive. To that end, I'm trying to make sure a web page looks and functions as intended on mobile devices. On the desktop, it works as expected. On the iPhone, it looks as expected, but doesn't work as expected. If you select the input field, it'll focus and bring up the keyboard. It however won't let you type anything. If you select the text input field once again, it'll finally allow you to type. Here's the link: ASLChoice Make sure you view it using an iOS device to reproduce the issue. Any ideas? I've googled this issue, and it seems no results are showing on Google that are similar to my issue. I've also searched StackOverflow. Feedback is certainly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:How to use XML and LINQ
@CONTENT:Using .net 4.5 VS 2012 I am trying to read the data from a XMl file <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<userCategories>
  <Cat>General</Cat>
  <Cat>Science</Cat>
  <Cat>HelloWorld</Cat>
</userCategories>
 This is the code that I wrote: //create XML document from file
XDocument myCatList = XDocument.Load(categoryPath);
//get all categories using LINQ
var myCategories =
    from element in myCatList.Descendants("userCategories")
//select all elements in XML where Element has name Cat - mean all if file like i write before
    select element.Element("Cat").Value;
    //create string for result
string data = String.Empty;
use foreach for getting all categories
foreach (var userCat in myCategories)
{
    //put in one string 
    data += string.Format("{0}\n", userCat);
}
 So I think that this kind of LINQ request must return me a string data with all values (General \n Science \n HelloWorld \n). but as result i got only General. What have I missed? Why do I get only the Item General instead of all of the nodes from the XML?
@CODE:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

    select element.Element("Cat").Value;

    {
        SubredditComicDataSource comicList = new SubredditComicDataSource();
        await comicList.LoadItems();
        var comicSources = comicList.GetAllItems();

        {
            var links = await this.currentManager.GetSubredditLinks(comicSources[i].UrlTitle, 6, 0);
            ComicDataWNGroup group = new ComicDataWNGroup("From " + comicSources[i].Title);
            for(int j = 0; j < links.Data.Count; j++)
            {

                BitmapImage img = await ThumbnailRetriever.GetThumbnailFromRedditUrl(linkItem.ThumbnailUrl);
                ComicDataItem item = new ComicDataItem(linkItem.Title, false, true, 0, img, 0, null, null, Visibility.Visible, Visibility.Collapsed);

    {
        { get; private set; }
    }
}
 Note: ComicDataItem is a class that mostly contains get set properties. I can post it later if it is needed. Using these two classes, I am trying to bind the Groups property of the ComicDataWNSource object to a GridView. The following code is the code I use for the binding. DataModel.ComicDataWNSource source = new DataModel.ComicDataWNSource(App.Manager);
await source.ObtainRecentContent();

CollectionViewSource viewSource = new CollectionViewSource();
viewSource.Source = source.Groups;
viewSource.IsSourceGrouped = true;
viewSource.ItemsPath = new PropertyPath("Items");

this.itemGridView.ItemsSource = viewSource;
 The GridView is the default one generated by Visual Studio when creating a new Grouped Items Page. I already changed the appropriate bindings to match up with the properties in the ComicDataWNGroup class and ComicDataItem class (I can post the XAML for the GridView as well if needed). Also, source.ObtainRecentContent() is currently filling up the Groups array with the correct data. The array of Groups and inner array of Items both have objects in them and neither of them are null. The problem arises on the line setting the view source to the grid view. Whenever I try it, it throws the following exception: Argument Exception: Value does not fall within the expected range. I don't have a clue what I could be doing wrong for this to happen. I already looked at this msdn page already, which shows you how to use a grouped grid view item and view source. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

@TITLE:Is it OK to send asynchronous notifications from server to client via the same TCP connection?
@CONTENT:As far as I understand the basics of the client-server model, generally only client may initiate requests; server responds to them. Now I've run into a system where the server sends asynchronous messages back to the client via the same persistent TCP connection whenever it wants. So, a couple of questions: Is it a right thing to do at all? It seems to really overcomplicate implementation of a client. Are there any nice patterns/methodologies I could use to implement a client for such a system in Python? Changing the server is not an option. Obviously, the client has to watch both the local request queue (i.e. requests to be sent to the server), and the incoming messages from the server. Launching two threads (Rx and Tx) per connection does not feel right to me. Using select() is a major PITA here. Do I miss something?

@TITLE:Comparing #include and using namespace std in C++ with import in Python
@CONTENT:I read through many pages on the internet about the #include statement and using namespace std phrase in C++ and I need some clarification. Since I already know Python I will use it as an analogy. First of all, in C++ #include library
 and in Python import library
 are the same. Then, in C++ #include library
using namespace std;
 and in Python from library import *
 are the same. For example, if we compare the first analogy, we know that in C++ #include <iostream>

int main()
{
std::cout << "hello" << std::endl;
return 0;
}
 is similar to the code below in Python (similar in using std and #include): import math

def main():
    print math.sqrt(12)
 If we were to compare the second analogy, we have that in C++ include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
cout << "hello world" << endl;
}
 and in Python from math import *
def main():
    print sqrt(12)
 are similar. Can you correct me if I am wrong?
@CODE:#include using namespace std #include library import library #include library
using namespace std; from library import * #include <iostream>

int main()
{
std::cout << "hello" << std::endl;
return 0;
} import math

def main():
    print math.sqrt(12) include <iostream>

@LINK:/questions/20760611/slow-location-search
@TITLE:Slow location search
@CONTENT:I have an issue with a search function, it works correctly but is taking between 14-18 second to load and that is causing me great pain. This is the search function I am using: $sql="select *, 
( 3959 * acos( cos( radians( $lat ) ) * cos( radians( `lat` ) ) * cos( radians( `lng` ) - radians( $lng ) ) + sin( radians( $lat ) ) * sin( radians( `lat` ) ) ) )  AS distance 
  FROM postcodes,
       details 
 WHERE `postcode`=postcodes.outcode 
 HAVING " . implode(" AND ", $searches)." 
    AND isactive='y' 
 ORDER BY `distance`";
 If anyone has any suggestions they would all be welcomed I have spent more time working on it, and understand exactly what the query is doing before I added any more information. This is now my updated query, I tried using a left join but I couldn't join the postcode table onto the cardetails table, and when I reversed it the cardetails columns where all showing up null. SELECT "column names",  
( 3959 * acos( cos( radians( $lat ) ) * cos( radians( `lat` ) ) * cos( radians(
`lng`   ) - radians( $lng ) ) + sin( radians( $lat ) ) * sin( radians( `lat` ) ) )) 
AS       distance
FROM details
inner JOIN car_postcodes ON details.postcode =  postcodes.outcode AND
distance  < 100 AND payment='y' AND expired='n' ORDER BY     
details.price
 That has drastically reduced the time taken to perform the query (down to around 6seconds) so I still need to improve that. The problem I am having now is that I am not able to use the column alias 'distance' to measure the distance between the user and the field within the table. As I cant use column alias to within the where clause. The answer I seem to have read on many other posts is a sub select,
@CODE:$sql="select *, 
( 3959 * acos( cos( radians( $lat ) ) * cos( radians( `lat` ) ) * cos( radians( `lng` ) - radians( $lng ) ) + sin( radians( $lat ) ) * sin( radians( `lat` ) ) ) )  AS distance

@TITLE:Using List vs Map?
@CONTENT:I have 7 textfields in my jsp which are presently being filled from a List of parameters which i get from server. By using a List I iterate parameters, which I feel gets order-dependent. Eg I have to traverse from index 0-6. So let's say later I change the order of parameters my logic will have to change and change code everytime. I thought of keeping parameters in a Map and then I will get like Map.get("xyz"). Is there a better solution to it??

@TITLE:Line Ending Problems in GIT [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: diff returning entire file for identical files 3 answers I'm working on a Mac and pulling a repo from GitHub. I've made a series of changes and GitTower or GIT in general is telling me: 410 files changed, 68615 lines added, 70606 lines deleted
 This is completely incorrect other than the files changed number. I edited at most 20 to 30 lines of code in each file, yet for each file edited GIT says I replaced the entire contents of the file. I'm assuming this is because the line endings are from a different OS? I normally don't have this issue, this is the first time I'm working on a public repo. I looked around at some other answers which led me to try and discover my current config via: git config core.autocrlf
 This returns nothing when I run it. So I'm assuming I need to set it? GitHub recommends "input" for Mac users, will this make sure that my files don't show the entire file was changed? Also, is there a way to fix the commit I mentioned so that it only shows the correct number of lines changed?

@CONTENT:I made a custom Document Manager for my project implementing some new low level functions (following this post). Now I would like to inject a custom configuration in my new Document Manager (I suppose it would be the same with an Entity Manager). I have no idea of how to do this... I want this config in my yaml files to set my custom Document Manager's parameters. The only way I found until now is to write a static function returning a hardcoded array of configuration, but it's a little dirty...) Is there a proper way or an alternative to do this?

 Things are working Nice. But, lets say if I have 2 products, if i select one item's qty from 1 to 2, cart is updated and updated cart is shown using AJAX. But, if I immediately change another item's qty then it doesnt work. The cart view file is inside class 'cart_form'. Helping hands are appreciated.

@TITLE:Friendship has_many through model with multiple status'
@CONTENT:Currently my User model has the following code:   has_many :notifications
  has_many :friendships
  has_many :friends, :through => :friendships, :conditions => { status: 'accepted' }
  has_many :requested_friends, :through => :friendships, :source => :friend, :conditions => { status: 'requested' }
  has_many :pending_friends, :through => :friendships, :source => :friend, :conditions => { status: 'pending' }
 And my Friendship model is as follows:   belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :friend, :class_name => "User"

  def self.request(user, friend)
    unless user == friend or Friendship.exists?(user_id: user, friend_id: friend)
      transaction do
        Friendship.create(:user => user, :friend => friend, :status => 'pending')
        Friendship.create(:user => friend, :friend => user, :status => 'requested')
      end
    else
      return "failed"
    end
  end

  def self.accept(user, friend)
    unless user == friend or Friendship.exists?(user_id: user, friend_id: friend)
      transaction do
        accepted_at = Time.now
        accept_one_side(user, friend, accepted_at)
        accept_one_side(friend, user, accepted_at)
      end
    else
      return "failed"
    end
  end

  def self.accept_one_side(user, friend, accepted_at)
    request = find_by_user_id_and_friend_id(user, friend)
    request.status = 'accepted'
    request.accepted_at = accepted_at
    request.save!
  end
 When I try to run my cucumber tests, however, I am getting this error: SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: users.status: SELECT "users".* FROM "users" INNER JOIN "friendships" ON "users"."id" = "friendships"."friend_id" WHERE "users"."status" = 'accepted' AND "friendships"."user_id" = ? (ActionView::Template::Error)
 I think that this means it is trying to only include inside in for example pending_friends, users which have the attribute status = "pending", where it should actually be including users who belong to friendships which have attribute status = "pending" Is this right? How would I go about fixing this? Also if you see any code that could be cleaned up I'd appreciate it :). Thanks!

@TITLE:Using Timers and Threads in Python to create assistive command line application
@CONTENT:Let me describe my scenario: I am developing a command line-based proof-of-concept for the instructional system, and I am writing it in Python. System works on the principles of behavioral psychology. I am rewarding users (children with special needs) for correct answers, and I am giving them correcting consequences for the wrong answers. I am also needing to provide hints to answers if they are struggling with answers. Here is a high level pseudo code for my application: Trial: Ask question such as 'What color is grass?' wait for answer a. If answer not provided within n seconds issue helping hint (e.g. "Gr, Gree") b. If answer is not provided within n+m seconds issue a corrective consequence. (e.g.,"Color of the grass is green.Let's try it again. ") and repeat the process c. If correct answer is provided during any n or n+m time praise the student and repeat the process. d. If the incorrect answer is provided during any of the n+m time, issue a corrective consequence and repeat the trial. Conclude the trial So here is my observation and a dilemma: Once I issue a question to student, I am waiting for events to happen on their own, or for my waiting to time out. I am also supposed to issue a hint during the wait period. So far, in my main flow I used two threading.Timer objects, one to issue hint after n seconds and another one to issue corrective consequence if the answer never happens during the n+m period. If answer happens of any kind during n or n+m time, I cancel the timers. My question, however, is related to the main process. I also want to cancel the waiting on the answer if the answer waiting time-out happen. Just as I cancel timers, I also want to cancel waiting on the command line for the input if my final no-answer timeout occurs. I am thinking to have one threading.Thread (get_answer) and two Timers (provide_hint, timeout_wait). Thread get_answer is waiting on a response from a command line. First timer (provide_hint) is giving a hint to user if there is no answer after n seconds. Second timer (timeout_wait) is canceling out the thread (get_answer) if no answer happens after some period of n+m seconds. Thread get_answer can cancel both timers if the answer happens be it correct or incorrect. Questions I have here are: A) Are my concurrent data structures correctly used and do you have any other suggestions? B) Are there any possible deadlock issues and how to avoid them? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:MIPS pipeline stalls with and without forwarding
@CONTENT:In the following sequence of MIPS instructions (entire program not shown): DADDUI R1, R1, #-8

BNE R1, R2, Loop
 I want to confirm the number of stalls required between the two instructions (in context of 5 stage MIPS pipeline - IF, ID/Reg, EX, MEM, WB) with and without forwarding. My understanding: (a) If there is no forwarding: In this case, 2 stalls are required (in cycle 5, R1 can be read in the ID stage for second instruction using split phase access for registers) (b) If there is forwarding: In this case, no stalls are required (EX stage on second instruction in cycle 4 can get R1 - 8 forwarded from ALU result for EX stage of first instruction in cycle 3 ; this is assuming branch is checking for equality in EX stage). Can someone please let me know if the above two answers are correct. Thanks.

</script>
 I pulled this code off a demo and am modifying it to fit my particular project; however, am attempting to run it as it is to test out features. The demo worked perfectly. The only major difference is they are using jquery 1.4.4 and I am using jquery 1.9.1. I cannot seem to get the back button to work correctly. The url changes when hitting back; however, the #right_column doesn't update at all. I copied this code directly off a demo and adjusted the div id to match mine, and it still doesn't work. The below line of code is the questionable code. /* the below code is to override back button to get the ajax content without reload*/
    $(window).bind('popstate', function() {
        $.ajax({url:location.pathname+'&rel=tab',success: function(data){
            $('#right_column').html(data);
        }});
    });
 Also, can I use location.pathname.replace('index.php', 'view.php') ? Not sure if this is the correct way of writing that particular code to replace index.php?variables... with view.php?variables... to load that page into the right column. See my other post if this part of the question confuses you... javascript/jquery: Need to substring in jquery (modified code)

 The previous code is what I am using to update a div element with content when a link is clicked with rel="tab" inside the <a> tag.

 But need to keep the full url for the last section of the javascript as pageurl. How would I do something like this? I did research on this and tried implementing the answer listed here: How to substring in jquery but couldn't seem to get it to work.

@TITLE:How to plot real time data from text file in MATLAB
@CONTENT:Im new to matlab coding so im still trying to get my head around things. Pretty much im working with interia sensors which output the sensors orientation data every 10ms. Im able to store this data into a text file which is continuously updating. My task now is to plot this data in real time. This involves continuously accessing and reading from the text file (every 10ms if possible) and graph this data with respect to time. Can any of you guys give me some guidance onto what would be the most effective way to do this. At this moment in time, the text file only stores data about one parameter (the x coordinate of the sensor). I can store this data in 2 way: Method 1: New data every 10ms. Each is stored in a new line. Method 2: I can make the text file only have the most recent piece of data (erasing previous data) Im able to use either of these methods.. whatever you guys think would be easier. Ive tried using other 3rd party software to graph this data from the text file, but they all seemed really jumpy and couldnt read from the text file fast enough. Thanks.

@TITLE:Swapping 2 pointers with inline assembly
@CONTENT:I'm developing with VS 2012, under 64 bit OS but output executable is 32 bit. Recently I was fiddling with swap algorithm. I did achieve it on C by; void swap(int *p1, int *p2)
{
  *p1 = *p1 + *p2;
  *p2 = *p1 - *p2;
  *p1 = *p1 - *p2;

{
  __asm {
    mov ebx, p1
    mov ecx, p2
    mov p1, ecx
    mov p2, ebx
  }
}
 and test the aswap() with these codes; int a = 10;
int b = 200;

// print out the initial values
printf("%x(%d) %x(%d)\n", &a, a, &b, b);

aswap(&a, &b);

// finally print out the swapped values
printf("%x(%d) %x(%d)\n", &a, a, &b, b);
 but the individual addresses and (consequently) the values are not changes. Please help me. Thanks in advance. Update 1: @ouah I've tested the swap() with these codes; #include <limits>

int a = INT_MAX;
int b = INT_MAX - 1;
...
 and here is my screenshot. Did I do something illegal with the memory?
@CODE:void swap(int *p1, int *p2)

  *p1 = *p1 + *p2;
  *p2 = *p1 - *p2;
  *p1 = *p1 - *p2;

@TITLE:New model insert overwriting others
@CONTENT:I have a rails application where I have two models called Column and Row: Column: has_many :rows

accepts_nested_attributes_for :rows, :reject_if => lambda { |b| b[:data].blank? }
 Row: belongs_to :column
 And the form: <%= form_for [@table, @row] do |f| %>

   <% @columns.each do |column| %>
       <%= f.label :data %><br>
       <%= f.text_area :data %>
   <% end %>

   <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
 and my create action in the controller: @row = Row.new(row_params)

if @row.save
  redirect_to table_rows_path, notice: 'row was successfully created.' 
else
 render action: 'new'
end
 and my new action: @columns = Column.where(:table_id => @table.id)
@row = Row.new(id: @table.id)
 So I have two problems. The first is if I have say two columns, so there will be two textfields on the new row page, and I enter "Test" in the first text field and "Another Test" in the second. The only thing that is getting saved is the second. The first one saves "Another Test" instead of "Test". Also, how can I get the row (which belongs to a column) to save a column_id inside each row? Thanks for all help!

@TITLE:Need to recalculate partition layout after filter in D3?
@CONTENT:I am using the Zoomable Icicle layout example to view a folder hierarchy. I currently use the filter function as follows: var data = partition.nodes(root).filter(
        function (d) {
            return d.parent == null ? d.children && d.dateAccessed > formattedD : d.children && d.dateAccessed > formattedD && d.parent.dateAccessed > formattedD;
        });
 This filters out whether a folder (with all its sub-folders) needs to be shown / not shown depending on whether the folder's dateAccessed is after a certain date. I then use the example code using this data variable to draw the partitions. rect = rect
               .data(data)
              .enter().append("rect")
              .attr("x", function (d) { console.log(!d.children); return x(d.x); })
              .attr("y", function (d) { return y(d.y); })
              .attr("width", function (d) { return x(d.dx); })
              .attr("height", function (d) { return y(d.dy); })
              .attr("fill", function (d) {
                  return (type == "Documents") ? '#9370DB' : (type == "Pictures") ? '#87CEFA' : (type == "Music") ? '#6B8E23' : (type == "Videos") ? '#F0E68C' : "#000000";
              })
              .on("click", clicked);
 I need the layout to recalculate where the folders are placed, as currently it keeps the space for a filtered out folder (see the attached image). (Please excuse the dis-organisation of the folders in the image, that's how it was when it was read in.) Many thanks.
@CODE:var data = partition.nodes(root).filter(

@TITLE:meaning of multiple instances sql server
@CONTENT:I am new to SQL and to SQL server and I am using the book to build my knowledge. During early parts of the book, the author has below para. I am confused with the sentence in bold and italics below. What is the purpose behind running multiple instances of SQL server on a given server? It seems that SQL server is a very costly software, in such case isn't installing multiple instances a costly task? The Database Engine sits at the core of the SQL Server components. The engine operates as a service on a machine, which is often referred to as an instance of SQL Server. You can run multiple instances of SQL Server on a given server. When you connect to SQL Server, the instance is the target of the connection. Once an application is connected, it sends Transact-SQL (T-SQL) statements to the instance. The instance in return sends data back to the client. Within the connection is a security layer that validates access to the data as specified by the database administrators (DBAs). The Database Engine enables you to leverage the full capabilities of all of the other components, such as accessing, storing, and securing the data..

@TITLE:Optimizing a method that cross fills missing data
@CONTENT:I have two tables of demographic data on employees of the same company from separate sources. After applying identical formatting and sorting each table, some columns are blank because that source didn't export that data. Both tables formatted looks like uniqueID | ssn | ... and are sorted by uniqueID. Source A doesn't export the social-security numbers, so the ssn column for table A is blank. Source B does export the social-security numbers. I want to fill in the ssn column of table A using the data from table B and the uniqueID as the key. Social Security number is also a unique ID for my purposes so there will never be an ssn paired with two uniqueID's or visa-versa. Persons (uniqueID | ssn) can appear multiple times on the same table, and different amount of times across tables. Some persons might be on one table and not the other. My current solution in VBA is, Function crossFillMissingDemos( tableA as Range, tableB as Range)
    Dim crntID As Variant: crntID = tableB.Cells(1,"A").Value
    For Each demoB In tableB.Rows
        If crntID <> demoB.Cells(1, "A").Value Then
            crntID = demoB.Cells(1, "A").Value
            For Each demoA In tableA.Rows

                    demoA.Cells(1,"B").Value = demoB.Cells(1,"B").Value   
                End If
            Next demoB
        End If
    Next demoB 
Exit Function
 which gets slower as the table sizes increase because it has tableB.personCount * tableA.RowCount operations. Is there more ways to optimize this function or better approach to it?

Both tables formatted looks like uniqueID | ssn | ... and are sorted by uniqueID. Source A doesn't export the social-security numbers, so the ssn column for table A is blank. Source B does export the social-security numbers. I want to fill in the ssn column of table A using the data from table B and the uniqueID as the key. Social Security number is also a unique ID for my purposes so there will never be an ssn paired with two uniqueID's or visa-versa. Persons (uniqueID | ssn) can appear multiple times on the same table, and different amount of times across tables. Some persons might be on one table and not the other. My current solution in VBA is, Function crossFillMissingDemos( tableA as Range, tableB as Range)
    Dim crntID As Variant: crntID = tableB.Cells(1,"A").Value
    For Each demoB In tableB.Rows
        If crntID <> demoB.Cells(1, "A").Value Then
            crntID = demoB.Cells(1, "A").Value
            For Each demoA In tableA.Rows
                If demoA.Cells(1, "A").Value = crntID Then
                    demoA.Cells(1,"B").Value = demoB.Cells(1,"B").Value   
                End If
            Next demoB
        End If
    Next demoB 
Exit Function
 which gets slower as the table sizes increase because it has tableB.personCount * tableA.RowCount operations. Is there more ways to optimize this function or better approach to it?
@CODE:uniqueID | ssn | ... uniqueID ssn ssn uniqueID uniqueID | ssn Function crossFillMissingDemos( tableA as Range, tableB as Range)
    Dim crntID As Variant: crntID = tableB.Cells(1,"A").Value
    For Each demoB In tableB.Rows
        If crntID <> demoB.Cells(1, "A").Value Then
            crntID = demoB.Cells(1, "A").Value
            For Each demoA In tableA.Rows
                If demoA.Cells(1, "A").Value = crntID Then
                    demoA.Cells(1,"B").Value = demoB.Cells(1,"B").Value   
                End If
            Next demoB
        End If
    Next demoB 
Exit Function tableB.personCount * tableA.RowCount VLOOKUP INDEX

@CONTENT:I have to run ruby script on windows 7 (I know that it's bad idea). My script creates folders (if they is not exist) and copies files into them. I'm using FileUtils lib to perform this job, like: FileUtils.mkdir_p(path)
FileUtils.cp_r(file.path, path)
FileUtils.touch(file)
 On ubuntu and mac everything is ok, but on windows 7 machine I got next error: Permission denied - ./program_folder/input/. (Errno::EACCES)

There are several developers using it's 'own' azure account to have their own servers but all connect to another server (database) on another account. So I think for this scenario it would be good to have all those servers on the same affinity group but there is no 1 azure account but many. In case that's possible, how can I restrict that database server to allow access only from all those boxes and itself ?

@TITLE:event.preventDefault() or return false don't work in IE9
@CONTENT:I'm trying to get the following code to work in all versions of IE, as it works find in other browsers:   <a href="" class="specificClass">Click Me </a>
    //Javascript
     $(".specificClass").click(
                        function(e) {
                            e.preventDefault();
                           // Do Something
                             //return false; Doesn't work either
                        }
                );
 Switching to href="#" makes it try to go to the top of the page, again only in IE9. For example: Leaving href="" redirects to the current link itself in IE9. <a href="#" onclick="doSomething(this); return false;"> Click Me Two </a>
 It seems like both approaches triggers the onclick Javascript to be called, but the default behavior for href="" is not getting overridden. If I use event.preventDefault() nothing happens. The below approach works: <a href="javascript:doSomething(this);"> Click Me Two </a>
function doSomething(me) {

    // event.preventDefault is not needed as the javascript is added via href

}
 However I don't want to have href="javascript:" or onclick ="doSomething"for all my anchor tags just to get it to work in IE9. I also don't want to use a different tag (tried the span tag for example) since it is tricky to style up in all browsers. Any other ideas? Looks like it is a legit bug, I have submitted a request to fix it. I have also put in a workaround for now: https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/812247/event-preventdefault-or-return-false-dont-work-in-ie9
@CODE:<a href="" class="specificClass">Click Me </a>

                             //return false; Doesn't work either
                        }
                ); href="#" href="" <a href="#" onclick="doSomething(this); return false;"> Click Me Two </a> href="" event.preventDefault() <a href="javascript:doSomething(this);"> Click Me Two </a>

@TITLE:How to get the URL of a xmlhttp request (AJAX)
@CONTENT:On w3schools.com(url) there is an example of how to do an AJAX call with plain Javascript. If you look at the example you will see the call is triggered by a button: <button type="button" onclick="loadXMLDoc()">Change Content</button>
 This is the function: function loadXMLDoc()
{
var xmlhttp;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
  {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
  xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  }
else
  {// code for IE6, IE5
  xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
  }
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()
  {
  if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    }
  }
xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
xmlhttp.send();
}
 What I would like to do is get the URL of the outgoing AJAX call which is ajax_info.txt(url): xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
 Im trying to put that URL in to an alert, so I tried calling the headers of the response using getAllResponseHeaders() hoping that it will give me the Host like so: if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    alert(xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders());
 It does give me all the headers but not the Host. So my next move was trying to set the Host myself using setRequestHeader() but then I realized the Header needs a Value which I had to send myself, so this will not work. What else can I try to get/fetch the outgoing AJAX URL in the alert? Please note the code is just an example and I know that changing headers(in this case) is prohibited because of Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
@CODE:<button type="button" onclick="loadXMLDoc()">Change Content</button> function loadXMLDoc()
{
var xmlhttp;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest)

  }
xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
xmlhttp.send();
} xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true); getAllResponseHeaders() Host if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)

@CONTENT:In my application I use scope: oauth2:https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile When loging in, application asks the user for permission to "Know who you are on google". I hate that behaviour, and I hate that text even more. I would instantly uninstall app that would ask me to "know who I am". And all I want to achieve is to have an authenticated user so he can call method on server (using endpoints). I don't even want to know his email, but google failed to deliver such functionality as well:more here. Anyway, is there any way to get rid of this question by defining some permission in android-manifest? I add more and more permissions but it does not help.

@TITLE:Getting fancybox and hover remove icon to work on the same image
@CONTENT:I'm using the tips on this question Overlay thumbnail with remove image button? to get a overlay hover remove icon to be shown on thumbnails on my page. But I'm also using fancybox and I can't seem to get both working at the same time. Because they both need the <a> element. Right now, this is my code. <div class="image-thumb" style="display: inline-block; background-image: url('<?php echo base_url().$path.$thumb; ?>');" align="center">
<a class="fancybox" href="<?php echo base_url().$path.$file->filename; ?>" rel="galery1" title="<?php echo $file->description; ?>">
    &nbsp;
</a><br>
<?php echo $file->description; ?></strong>
</div>
 The CSS: .image-thumb { 
position: relative; 
width: 150px;
height: 150px; 
/* apply background-image url inline on the element since it is part of the content */
background: transparent url() no-repeat center center;
}

.image-thumb a { 
display: none;
position: absolute; 
top: 2px;  /* position in bottom right corner, assuming image is 16x16 */
left: 126px; 
width: 22px; 
height: 22px; 
background: transparent url('/path/to/remove-icon.gif') no-repeat 0 0;
}   

.image-thumb:hover a { 
display: block;
}
 In the <a> element, if I set the class to fancybox, it works, and if I remove it, the hover icon works. Out of ideas to get them both working. Any help would be great.
@CODE:<a> <div class="image-thumb" style="display: inline-block; background-image: url('<?php echo base_url().$path.$thumb; ?>');" align="center">
<a class="fancybox" href="<?php echo base_url().$path.$file->filename; ?>" rel="galery1" title="<?php echo $file->description; ?>">

@TITLE:how to change (and keep) the color of a button on click
@CONTENT:I would like to toggle the color of a button upon a user click. Right now, when the user clicks the button momentarily changes color but then immediately changes back to the 1st color in milliseconds. I am using a .jsp file to communicate to a server on these button clicks which sends information to the server, and when the server communicates back it refreshed the page. Is this re-setting the style of the button when the page refreshes? I am using a class 'button' to define the style. My question is: how can I indefinitely change the color of the button? <form action="FirstServlet" method="get"> 
<div id="TVs"> 
  <%for (int i=1; i<=numTargets; i++) {         
    <button id="TV<%=i%>" name= "TV<%=i%>" class="button" onClick= "TVbuttonPressed('TV<%=i%>')">

...
    function TVbuttonPressed(id){       
    document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = 0xFFFF00;
}
 Eventually I am planning to have the function be: function TVbuttonPressed(id){       
  if (document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  == A)
       document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = B

   else (document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  == B)
       document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = A
}
 Can someone help explain? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/20749192/json-encode-for-multiple-mysql-rows
@TITLE:JSON encode for multiple MySQL rows [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: JSON encode MySQL results 16 answers I'm working on outputting multiple MySQL JSON rows to an HTML table via PHP (server side) and jQuery (front end) through a simple search box. I've successfully managed to parse one row of JSON to the table but now need to accommodate multiple rows of JSON data. My HTML table on the search page looks something like this: ARTIST | TITLE | LOCATION 
U2     | One   | Ireland 
Foals  | Miami | UK
 and the JSON file passed to it utilises similar headings: {"ARTIST":"Katy Perry","LOCATION":"United States", "TRACKTITLE":"Roar"}
 I've been playing around with the code for a while, incorporating arrays to loop through the data. This works in as much as it loops through the MySQL rows correctly and successfully sends multiple rows of data back in JSON format (I've decoded my search page in Firebug). The problem is that my jQuery file can't place it into my HTML table, resulting in a blank page. I've tried various methods of arrays from previous Stackoverflow questions but can't quite get it to work, being returned the 'ARTIST', 'TRACKTITLE' and 'LOCATION' fields with every returned result extract from PHP file: $result = mysql_query($sql);
$data = array();
while ($array = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
$data[] = $array;
}
echo json_encode($data);
 Edited to include jQuery extract and more specific question: function(data) {
var sentData=JSON.parse(data)
for (var i = 0; i < sentData.ARTIST.length; ++i)
{
tr = $('<tr/>');
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.ARTIST + "</td>");
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.TRACKTITLE + "</td>");
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.LOCATION + "</td>");
$('#multiple').append(tr);
}
});
 How can I parse only the corresponding values of each 'ARTIST', TRACKTITLE' and 'LOCATION' result using the JSON.parse method? This is the full returned JSON string: [{"ARTIST":"Katy Perry","TRACKTITLE":"Roar","LOCATION":"United States"}, {"ARTIST":"U2","TRACKTITLE":"One","LOCATION":"Ireland"}]
@CODE:ARTIST | TITLE | LOCATION 
U2     | One   | Ireland 
Foals  | Miami | UK {"ARTIST":"Katy Perry","LOCATION":"United States", "TRACKTITLE":"Roar"} $result = mysql_query($sql);
$data = array();
while ($array = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
$data[] = $array;
}
echo json_encode($data); function(data) {
var sentData=JSON.parse(data)

{
tr = $('<tr/>');
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.ARTIST + "</td>");

}

@LINK:/questions/20748864/is-there-a-way-to-programmatically-construct-an-open-office-document-from-two-ex
@TITLE:Is there a way to programmatically construct an Open Office document from two existing documents?
@CONTENT:I have two documents, one in Spanish and one in English (the English is a translated version of the original in Spanish). I am creating a third document from the two, which includes the Spanish on each evenly numbered page, and the corresponding English translation on the opposite odd-numbered page. I am using up the entire page on both sides except at the end of a chapter (each new chapter gets a page break, so it can start at the top of the page). Admittedly, in order to use up the entire page, there are occasions where portions of the text are on the next page (that is to say, the English translation of what appears at the bottom of page 18 in Spanish on occasion appears at the top of page 21, rather than at the bottom of page 19). I am currently manually doing the following to accomplish this, with all three Open Office documents open (Spanish.odt, English.odt, and SpanishEnglish.odt): 0) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from Spanish.odt to the next (even-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
1) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (odd-numbered) page
2) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from English.odt to the next (odd-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
3) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (even-numbered) page
 Also, periodically (when the chapter end is reached), I insert a Page Break; if the end of the chapter doesn't fit on one page for either the Spanish or English (while the other does, of course) in SpanishEnglish.odt, I reduce the font size of the too-long page (from Verdana 10 to Verdana 9) to force it to constrain itself to that page, so that the chapters begin side-by-side (Spanish on the left/even, English on the right/odd) without having any blank pages. As you can doubtless imagine -- especially with a large document, which this is -- this procedure gets very tedious very quickly. Is there a way to programmatically accomplish the same thing in C#? UPDATE Shujaat Siddiqui, I assume you mean change these last lines: The Dangerous Pelican Movie
. . .
La pel?cula de los pel?canos peligrosos
 ...to this: The Dangerous Pelican Movie&&&&
. . .
La pel?cula de los pel?canos peligrosos&&&&
 ...by appending "&&&&" to the last line - Correctomundo? But in many cases this additional text ("&&&&") will push the contents to the next page (one or more of the ampersands will flow onto the following page), no?
@CODE:0) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from Spanish.odt to the next (even-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
1) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (odd-numbered) page
2) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from English.odt to the next (odd-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
3) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (even-numbered) page The Dangerous Pelican Movie

@TITLE:Creating a spreadsheet
@CONTENT:I have an application I'm building that is basically just an online spreadsheet. I've been wondering how I should start building this. My primary tech stack is with Rails, but I can change depending on the job, though I'd prefer to keep at least the backend with Rails (and then maybe a backbone frontend?) The application isn't exactly a spreadsheet though, instead of columns going by A,B,C like they do in Excel, users will be able to create names for columns. So for example they could create a column called Revenue and have the rows 1,2,3 have values of $1000, $2000, and $3000. Users will also be able to sort the columns ASC or DESC. I thought about just having a Mysql table with say 30 fields where 15 are the values, and 15 are the corresponding column names. Except won't this be an incredibly inefficient method? Not to mention there would have to be a hard limit on how many columns a user could put in. So is there a better method? Or the method I just described the best way.

@LINK:/questions/20747488/wai-aria-alert-on-form-submit-with-page-reloading
@TITLE:WAI ARIA alert on form submit (with page reloading)
@CONTENT:Let's say we have a classic form - a few input fields that must meet some pattern. When user enters incorrect data and submits this form all the fields that are filled wrong are marked as invalid and appropriate error message is provided for every incorrect field. I need to make this form WAI ARIA compliant, so that after form submission the accessibility tools will see these errors first. I've found solution that implements it by dynamic html modification using JS (http://jsfiddle.net/nS3TU/1/): HTML: <form id="signup" method="post" action="">
    <p id="errors" role="alert" aria-live="assertive"></p>
    <p>
        <label for="first">First Name (required)</label>
        <input type="text" id="first">

    <p>
        <input type="submit" id="button" value="Submit">

</form>
 JS: $('#signup').submit(function () {
    $('#errors').html('');
    if ($('#first').val() === '') {
        $('#errors').append('Please enter your first name.');
    }
    return false;
});
 Here validation does not reload page, and the "alert" area is dynamically modified. In my case the page is reloaded on validation phase, and I don't know how to make aria alert work. After hours of investigation I didn't find any solution at all. Any ideas?
@CODE:<form id="signup" method="post" action="">

@TITLE:Masonry - Scroll to clicked element on layout -infinite
@CONTENT:I am trying to do 2 actions on one click on the element using Masonry library. It should work the way that when I click on the element it expands (I am adding class to have box bigger) and in the meantime the page is scrolling to that box. The problem is that when you expand the box it may drop a line down and that means the function called to scroll will scroll to wrong place. It should do the layout and get new position of the element and then move... I got it almost working. It is expanding the box and doing new layout and when finished it scrolls the page to the box... but it looks a little bit strange and it first moves all the boxes for new layout, then stops and strars moving the page. I would prefer that to be done in one move. It that possible. Here is my code: $(document).ready(function() {


    var $container = $('#container');
    // initialize

    var msnry = new Masonry( container, {
        columnWidth: 280,
        itemSelector: '.item'
    } );



    $('.openBoks').on('click', function() {

                    // this is my element
                    var thisBox = $(this).parent().parent();

                    // adding the class to expand it
                    thisBox.addClass('opened');

                    // calling method to do new layout
                    msnry.layout();


            msnry.on( 'layoutComplete', function( msnryInstance, laidOutItems ) 
                      {

                $('html, body').animate({

                    }, 700);

@TITLE:Determine the internet time of another country in Java
@CONTENT:I am developing a Java application that will be used by people from around the world. One feature requires it to display the current time in Melbourne, Australia. I have found this answer and adapted the code as follows, but it returns my current time (as expected). It uses the Apache Commons Net library:     try {
        String TIME_SERVER = "time-a.nist.gov";   
        NTPUDPClient timeClient = new NTPUDPClient();
        InetAddress inetAddress = InetAddress.getByName(TIME_SERVER);
        TimeInfo timeInfo = timeClient.getTime(inetAddress);
        long returnTime = timeInfo.getMessage().getTransmitTimeStamp().getTime();
        return new Date(returnTime);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        return null;
    }
 How can I modify this code to return the time in Melbourne, rather than my time? I am open to other solutions to solve this problem as well. Thank you! EDIT: Taking Jon's advice, I have used the JodaTime library and built the following code to solve the problem. It can be used for other time zones by changing Australia/Melbourne to any timezone found here.     try {
        //Get the time for the current time zone.
        String TIME_SERVER = "time-a.nist.gov";   
        NTPUDPClient timeClient = new NTPUDPClient();
        InetAddress inetAddress = InetAddress.getByName(TIME_SERVER);
        TimeInfo timeInfo = timeClient.getTime(inetAddress);
        long returnTime = timeInfo.getMessage().getTransmitTimeStamp().getTime();

        //Format it to the Melbourne TimeZone.
        DateTimeZone tzMelbourne = DateTimeZone.forID("Australia/Melbourne");
        return new DateTime(returnTime).toDateTime(tzMelbourne);

@TITLE:Rollover SVG images resizing in Safari and IE
@CONTENT:I have used a simple jquery image swap for some icons and have used svg as the images. $(function(){
    $('img.rollover').hover(function(){
        var e = $(this);
        e.data('originalSrc', e.attr('src'));
        e.attr('src', e.attr('data-rollover'));
    }, function(){
        var e = $(this);
        e.attr('src', e.data('originalSrc'));
    }); /* a preloader could easily go here too */
});
 it all works fine in chrome, but in safari after you have rolled off the icons, the browser resizes them really small. In IE they are just small from the word go. I would love someone to tell me why this might be happening, and if this is the best way to go about using SVG images. <a class="icon-link" href="#" data-title="Lucid"><div id="icon-sidebar"><img class="rollover" src="images/lucid_icon.svg" data-rollover="images/lucid_icon_white.svg" /></div></a>

#icon-sidebar {width:50%; height:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; margin-bottom:20px;}
    img.rollover {width:100%;}
 Here is the link to the test site i am working. Much More Creative Thanks appreciated...

@TITLE:Three.js : Invisible background for background and png particles
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble setting invisible background and alpha channel on my particles. For christmas I wanted to use your example script wegl_particles_sprite. Adapted to the situation. I have set the code in a full screen div in foreground and succeeded to make it unclickable so that I can still use my website. The problem is that I couldn't set png alpha channels to transparent even with transparent=true;. First I set the background transparent: OK renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { clearAlpha: 1, alpha:true } );
 But can't load my snowflakes with alpha channels transparents. Need help someone for making my christmas magic? Edit: Sorry was a typing error, the problem remains! for the particles ^^

@TITLE:Editing a has_one association in ActiveAdmin - destroying when attribute is blanked
@CONTENT:I've got a model in which a very small percentage of the objects will have a rather large descriptive text. Trying to keep my database somewhat normalized, I wanted to extract this descriptive text to a separate model, but I'm having trouble creating a sensible workflow in ActiveAdmin. My models look like this: class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :long_description

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :long_description, reject_if: proc { |attrs| attrs['text'].blank? }
end

class LongDescription < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :text, :person_id
  belongs_to :person

  validates :text, presence: true
end
 Currently I've created a form for editing the Person model, looking somewhat like this:   form do |f|
    ...
    f.inputs :for => [
                      :long_description,
                      f.object.long_description || LongDescription.new
                     ] do |ld_f|
      ld_f.input :text
    end

    f.actions
  end
 This works for adding/editing the LongDescription object, and it avdois validating/creating the LongDescription object if no text is entered. What I'd like to achieve is to also be able to remove the LongDescription object, for example if the text attribute is ever set to an empty string/nil again. Anyone with better Rails or ActiveAdmin skills than me know how to achieve this?
@CODE:class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :long_description

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :long_description, reject_if: proc { |attrs| attrs['text'].blank? }
end

class LongDescription < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :text, :person_id
  belongs_to :person

  validates :text, presence: true
end form do |f|
    ...
    f.inputs :for => [
                      :long_description,
                      f.object.long_description || LongDescription.new
                     ] do |ld_f|
      ld_f.input :text
    end

    f.actions
  end text reject_if: reject_if: validates_presence_of :text text text text text long_description

@TITLE:Correct way to use a default date in a django model
@CONTENT:I have two models, both of which have a date field defaulting to the current date, whatever that may be. Today someone pointed out they were getting an error from one of them, which was setting dates to 19 December instead of 23 December (today at the time of writing). I had thought both fields were set up identically so I checked for an unintended difference between the two and found one. But I was surprised because the 'working' one was the one that looked to me like it contained an error. The fields are set up like this: # Working field
date_stamp = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today)

# Broken field
date_statp = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today())
 I always thought the today function needed to be called to ensure the value wasn't cached. Is the reverse in fact true? Can someone explain how these two are actually interpreted on model instance creation?

@LINK:/questions/20750158/how-to-get-the-url-of-a-xmlhttp-request-ajax
@TITLE:How to get the URL of a xmlhttp request (AJAX)
@CONTENT:On w3schools.com(url) there is an example of how to do an AJAX call with plain Javascript. If you look at the example you will see the call is triggered by a button: <button type="button" onclick="loadXMLDoc()">Change Content</button>
 This is the function: function loadXMLDoc()
{
var xmlhttp;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
  {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
  xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  }
else
  {// code for IE6, IE5
  xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
  }
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()
  {
  if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    }
  }
xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
xmlhttp.send();
}
 What I would like to do is get the URL of the outgoing AJAX call which is ajax_info.txt(url): xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
 Im trying to put that URL in to an alert, so I tried calling the headers of the response using getAllResponseHeaders() hoping that it will give me the Host like so: if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    alert(xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders());
 It does give me all the headers but not the Host. So my next move was trying to set the Host myself using setRequestHeader() but then I realized the Header needs a Value which I had to send myself, so this will not work. What else can I try to get/fetch the outgoing AJAX URL in the alert? Please note the code is just an example and I know that changing headers(in this case) is prohibited because of Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
@CODE:<button type="button" onclick="loadXMLDoc()">Change Content</button> function loadXMLDoc()
{
var xmlhttp;
if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
  {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
  xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  }
else
  {// code for IE6, IE5
  xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
  }

  {

    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    }
  }
xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true);
xmlhttp.send();
} xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax_info.txt",true); getAllResponseHeaders() Host if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;
    alert(xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders()); setRequestHeader()

@TITLE:Avoiding asking for permission in application
@CONTENT:In my application I use scope: oauth2:https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile When loging in, application asks the user for permission to "Know who you are on google". I hate that behaviour, and I hate that text even more. I would instantly uninstall app that would ask me to "know who I am". And all I want to achieve is to have an authenticated user so he can call method on server (using endpoints). I don't even want to know his email, but google failed to deliver such functionality as well:more here. Anyway, is there any way to get rid of this question by defining some permission in android-manifest? I add more and more permissions but it does not help. At the moment I have: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_CREDENTIALS" />    
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NETWORK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PROFILE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCOUNT_MANAGER"/> 
 And Google still asks for the permission in app. Anyone knows how to authenticate user with oauth2 and not to ask for permission by a google-forced popup in my application?

@TITLE:Getting fancybox and hover remove icon to work on the same image
@CONTENT:I'm using the tips on this question Overlay thumbnail with remove image button? to get a overlay hover remove icon to be shown on thumbnails on my page. But I'm also using fancybox and I can't seem to get both working at the same time. Because they both need the <a> element. Right now, this is my code. <div class="image-thumb" style="display: inline-block; background-image: url('<?php echo base_url().$path.$thumb; ?>');" align="center">
<a class="fancybox" href="<?php echo base_url().$path.$file->filename; ?>" rel="galery1" title="<?php echo $file->description; ?>">
    &nbsp;
</a><br>
<?php echo $file->description; ?></strong>
</div>
 The CSS: .image-thumb { 
position: relative; 
width: 150px;
height: 150px; 
/* apply background-image url inline on the element since it is part of the content */
background: transparent url() no-repeat center center;
}

.image-thumb a { 
display: none;
position: absolute; 
top: 2px;  /* position in bottom right corner, assuming image is 16x16 */
left: 126px; 
width: 22px; 
height: 22px; 
background: transparent url('/path/to/remove-icon.gif') no-repeat 0 0;
}   

.image-thumb:hover a { 
display: block;
}
 In the <a> element, if I set the class to fancybox, it works, and if I remove it, the hover icon works. Out of ideas to get them both working. Any help would be great.
@CODE:<a> <div class="image-thumb" style="display: inline-block; background-image: url('<?php echo base_url().$path.$thumb; ?>');" align="center">

Right now, when the user clicks the button momentarily changes color but then immediately changes back to the 1st color in milliseconds. I am using a .jsp file to communicate to a server on these button clicks which sends information to the server, and when the server communicates back it refreshed the page. Is this re-setting the style of the button when the page refreshes? I am using a class 'button' to define the style. My question is: how can I indefinitely change the color of the button? <form action="FirstServlet" method="get"> 
<div id="TVs"> 
  <%for (int i=1; i<=numTargets; i++) {         
    <button id="TV<%=i%>" name= "TV<%=i%>" class="button" onClick= "TVbuttonPressed('TV<%=i%>')">

...
    function TVbuttonPressed(id){       
    document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = 0xFFFF00;
}
 Eventually I am planning to have the function be: function TVbuttonPressed(id){       
  if (document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  == A)
       document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = B

   else (document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  == B)
       document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = A
}
 Can someone help explain? Thanks.

} function TVbuttonPressed(id){       
  if (document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  == A)
       document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = B

   else (document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  == B)
       document.getElementById(id).style.backgroundColor  = A
} style.backgroundColor rgba(23,143,255,1)

@TITLE:JSON encode for multiple MySQL rows [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: JSON encode MySQL results 16 answers I'm working on outputting multiple MySQL JSON rows to an HTML table via PHP (server side) and jQuery (front end) through a simple search box. I've successfully managed to parse one row of JSON to the table but now need to accommodate multiple rows of JSON data. My HTML table on the search page looks something like this: ARTIST | TITLE | LOCATION 
U2     | One   | Ireland 
Foals  | Miami | UK
 and the JSON file passed to it utilises similar headings: {"ARTIST":"Katy Perry","LOCATION":"United States", "TRACKTITLE":"Roar"}
 I've been playing around with the code for a while, incorporating arrays to loop through the data. This works in as much as it loops through the MySQL rows correctly and successfully sends multiple rows of data back in JSON format (I've decoded my search page in Firebug). The problem is that my jQuery file can't place it into my HTML table, resulting in a blank page. I've tried various methods of arrays from previous Stackoverflow questions but can't quite get it to work, being returned the 'ARTIST', 'TRACKTITLE' and 'LOCATION' fields with every returned result extract from PHP file: $result = mysql_query($sql);
$data = array();
while ($array = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
$data[] = $array;
}
echo json_encode($data);
 Edited to include jQuery extract and more specific question: function(data) {
var sentData=JSON.parse(data)
for (var i = 0; i < sentData.ARTIST.length; ++i)
{
tr = $('<tr/>');
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.ARTIST + "</td>");
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.TRACKTITLE + "</td>");
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.LOCATION + "</td>");
$('#multiple').append(tr);
}
});
 How can I parse only the corresponding values of each 'ARTIST', TRACKTITLE' and 'LOCATION' result using the JSON.parse method? This is the full returned JSON string: [{"ARTIST":"Katy Perry","TRACKTITLE":"Roar","LOCATION":"United States"}, {"ARTIST":"U2","TRACKTITLE":"One","LOCATION":"Ireland"}]
@CODE:ARTIST | TITLE | LOCATION 
U2     | One   | Ireland

while ($array = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
$data[] = $array;
}
echo json_encode($data); function(data) {

{
tr = $('<tr/>');
tr.append("<td>" + sentData.ARTIST + "</td>");

}

@TITLE:Is there a way to programmatically construct an Open Office document from two existing documents?
@CONTENT:I have two documents, one in Spanish and one in English (the English is a translated version of the original in Spanish). I am creating a third document from the two, which includes the Spanish on each evenly numbered page, and the corresponding English translation on the opposite odd-numbered page. I am using up the entire page on both sides except at the end of a chapter (each new chapter gets a page break, so it can start at the top of the page). Admittedly, in order to use up the entire page, there are occasions where portions of the text are on the next page (that is to say, the English translation of what appears at the bottom of page 18 in Spanish on occasion appears at the top of page 21, rather than at the bottom of page 19). I am currently manually doing the following to accomplish this, with all three Open Office documents open (Spanish.odt, English.odt, and SpanishEnglish.odt): 0) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from Spanish.odt to the next (even-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
1) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (odd-numbered) page
2) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from English.odt to the next (odd-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
3) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (even-numbered) page
 Also, periodically (when the chapter end is reached), I insert a Page Break; if the end of the chapter doesn't fit on one page for either the Spanish or English (while the other does, of course) in SpanishEnglish.odt, I reduce the font size of the too-long page (from Verdana 10 to Verdana 9) to force it to constrain itself to that page, so that the chapters begin side-by-side (Spanish on the left/even, English on the right/odd) without having any blank pages. As you can doubtless imagine -- especially with a large document, which this is -- this procedure gets very tedious very quickly. Is there a way to programmatically accomplish the same thing in C#? UPDATE Shujaat Siddiqui, I assume you mean change these last lines: The Dangerous Pelican Movie
. . .
La pel?cula de los pel?canos peligrosos
 ...to this: The Dangerous Pelican Movie&&&&
. . .
La pel?cula de los pel?canos peligrosos&&&&
 ...by appending "&&&&" to the last line - Correctomundo? But in many cases this additional text ("&&&&") will push the contents to the next page (one or more of the ampersands will flow onto the following page), no?
@CODE:0) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from Spanish.odt to the next (even-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt
1) Mash the Enter key to move to the next (odd-numbered) page
2) Cut and paste exactly one page of material from English.odt to the next (odd-numbered) page of SpanishEnglish.odt

@TITLE:Creating a spreadsheet
@CONTENT:I have an application I'm building that is basically just an online spreadsheet. I've been wondering how I should start building this. My primary tech stack is with Rails, but I can change depending on the job, though I'd prefer to keep at least the backend with Rails (and then maybe a backbone frontend?) The application isn't exactly a spreadsheet though, instead of columns going by A,B,C like they do in Excel, users will be able to create names for columns. So for example they could create a column called Revenue and have the rows 1,2,3 have values of $1000, $2000, and $3000. Users will also be able to sort the columns ASC or DESC. I thought about just having a Mysql table with say 30 fields where 15 are the values, and 15 are the corresponding column names. Except won't this be an incredibly inefficient method? Not to mention there would have to be a hard limit on how many columns a user could put in. So is there a better method? Or the method I just described the best way.

@LINK:/questions/20747488/wai-aria-alert-on-form-submit-with-page-reloading
@TITLE:WAI ARIA alert on form submit (with page reloading)
@CONTENT:Let's say we have a classic form - a few input fields that must meet some pattern. When user enters incorrect data and submits this form all the fields that are filled wrong are marked as invalid and appropriate error message is provided for every incorrect field. I need to make this form WAI ARIA compliant, so that after form submission the accessibility tools will see these errors first. I've found solution that implements it by dynamic html modification using JS (http://jsfiddle.net/nS3TU/1/): HTML: <form id="signup" method="post" action="">
    <p id="errors" role="alert" aria-live="assertive"></p>
    <p>
        <label for="first">First Name (required)</label>
        <input type="text" id="first">
    </p>
    <p>
        <input type="submit" id="button" value="Submit">

</form>
 JS: $('#signup').submit(function () {
    $('#errors').html('');
    if ($('#first').val() === '') {
        $('#errors').append('Please enter your first name.');
    }
    return false;
});
 Here validation does not reload page, and the "alert" area is dynamically modified. In my case the page is reloaded on validation phase, and I don't know how to make aria alert work. After hours of investigation I didn't find any solution at all. Any ideas?
@CODE:<form id="signup" method="post" action="">

@TITLE:Masonry - Scroll to clicked element on layout -infinite
@CONTENT:I am trying to do 2 actions on one click on the element using Masonry library. It should work the way that when I click on the element it expands (I am adding class to have box bigger) and in the meantime the page is scrolling to that box. The problem is that when you expand the box it may drop a line down and that means the function called to scroll will scroll to wrong place. It should do the layout and get new position of the element and then move... I got it almost working. It is expanding the box and doing new layout and when finished it scrolls the page to the box... but it looks a little bit strange and it first moves all the boxes for new layout, then stops and strars moving the page. I would prefer that to be done in one move. It that possible. Here is my code: $(document).ready(function() {


    var $container = $('#container');
    // initialize

    var msnry = new Masonry( container, {
        columnWidth: 280,
        itemSelector: '.item'
    } );



    $('.openBoks').on('click', function() {

                    // this is my element
                    var thisBox = $(this).parent().parent();

                    // adding the class to expand it
                    thisBox.addClass('opened');

                    // calling method to do new layout
                    msnry.layout();


            msnry.on( 'layoutComplete', function( msnryInstance, laidOutItems )

@TITLE:Determine the internet time of another country in Java
@CONTENT:I am developing a Java application that will be used by people from around the world. One feature requires it to display the current time in Melbourne, Australia. I have found this answer and adapted the code as follows, but it returns my current time (as expected). It uses the Apache Commons Net library:     try {
        String TIME_SERVER = "time-a.nist.gov";   
        NTPUDPClient timeClient = new NTPUDPClient();
        InetAddress inetAddress = InetAddress.getByName(TIME_SERVER);
        TimeInfo timeInfo = timeClient.getTime(inetAddress);
        long returnTime = timeInfo.getMessage().getTransmitTimeStamp().getTime();
        return new Date(returnTime);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        return null;
    }
 How can I modify this code to return the time in Melbourne, rather than my time? I am open to other solutions to solve this problem as well. Thank you! EDIT: Taking Jon's advice, I have used the JodaTime library and built the following code to solve the problem. It can be used for other time zones by changing Australia/Melbourne to any timezone found here.     try {

 it all works fine in chrome, but in safari after you have rolled off the icons, the browser resizes them really small. In IE they are just small from the word go. I would love someone to tell me why this might be happening, and if this is the best way to go about using SVG images. <a class="icon-link" href="#" data-title="Lucid"><div id="icon-sidebar"><img class="rollover" src="images/lucid_icon.svg" data-rollover="images/lucid_icon_white.svg" /></div></a>

@TITLE:Editing a has_one association in ActiveAdmin - destroying when attribute is blanked
@CONTENT:I've got a model in which a very small percentage of the objects will have a rather large descriptive text. Trying to keep my database somewhat normalized, I wanted to extract this descriptive text to a separate model, but I'm having trouble creating a sensible workflow in ActiveAdmin. My models look like this: class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :long_description

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :long_description, reject_if: proc { |attrs| attrs['text'].blank? }
end

class LongDescription < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :text, :person_id
  belongs_to :person

  validates :text, presence: true
end
 Currently I've created a form for editing the Person model, looking somewhat like this:   form do |f|
    ...
    f.inputs :for => [
                      :long_description,
                      f.object.long_description || LongDescription.new
                     ] do |ld_f|
      ld_f.input :text
    end

    f.actions
  end
 This works for adding/editing the LongDescription object, and it avdois validating/creating the LongDescription object if no text is entered. What I'd like to achieve is to also be able to remove the LongDescription object, for example if the text attribute is ever set to an empty string/nil again. Anyone with better Rails or ActiveAdmin skills than me know how to achieve this?
@CODE:class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :long_description

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :long_description, reject_if: proc { |attrs| attrs['text'].blank? }
end

class LongDescription < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :text, :person_id
  belongs_to :person

  validates :text, presence: true
end form do |f|
    ...
    f.inputs :for => [
                      :long_description,
                      f.object.long_description || LongDescription.new
                     ] do |ld_f|
      ld_f.input :text
    end

    f.actions
  end text reject_if: reject_if: validates_presence_of :text text text text text long_description

@TITLE:Correct way to use a default date in a django model
@CONTENT:I have two models, both of which have a date field defaulting to the current date, whatever that may be. Today someone pointed out they were getting an error from one of them, which was setting dates to 19 December instead of 23 December (today at the time of writing). I had thought both fields were set up identically so I checked for an unintended difference between the two and found one. But I was surprised because the 'working' one was the one that looked to me like it contained an error. The fields are set up like this: # Working field
date_stamp = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today)

# Broken field
date_statp = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today())
 I always thought the today function needed to be called to ensure the value wasn't cached. Is the reverse in fact true? Can someone explain how these two are actually interpreted on model instance creation?

        }
    });
});

@LINK:/questions/20739562/converting-large-numbers-into-letters-and-back-again
@TITLE:Converting large numbers into letters (and back again)
@CONTENT:Is there a term for the idea of storing large numbers as letters? For example let's say I have the (relatively small) number 138201162401719 and I want to shrink the number of characters (I know this does not help with saving disk space) to the fewest possible number of characters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (but i count them as 25 since we need a zero letter). If I start splitting up my large number into pieces that are each 25 or less I get: 13, 8, 20, 11, 6, 24, 0, 17, 19 If I then count the numbers of the alphabet a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3... I can convert this to: NIULGYART So I went from 15 digits long (138201162401719) to 9 characters long (NIULGYART). This could of course be easily converted back to the original number as well. So...my first question is "Does this have a name" and my second "Does anyone have PHP code that will do the conversion (in both directions)?" I am looking for proper terminology so that I can do my own research in Google...though working code examples are cool too.

@CONTENT:Using the following tutorials and github templates here, here, and here , I've spent the better part of the evening wrestling with django and mezzanine. Right now I've got a mezzanine-project, called uccdev which is working nicely when I run python manage.py runserver. Now, I want to use gunicorn and foreman to get work with thing, so that I can later upload my projects to heroku. According to Josh Finnie, Adding the below Procfile got Mezzanine running on Gunicorn and successfully got Heroku to serve my static files. First if runs collectstatic to insure that all the static media is in the appropriate place within your app, and second it runs the Gunicorn server. web: python manage.py collectstatic --noinput; python manage.py run_gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT I added gunicorn as an application in my settings.py, but every time I run foreman start in the terminal it shuts down immediately with the following error message.

@LINK:/questions/20737720/react-js-component-creating-parent-child-relations-and-iterating
@TITLE:React.js component creating parent child relations and iterating
@CONTENT:I'm trying to have a component that can find parent/child components of the same type. These components will also have to be "repeatable" programmatically. Such that: <MyComponent id="1>
 <div>
  <MyComponent id="2">
   <div>
    <MyComponent id="3"></MyComponent>
   </div>
   <div>
    <MyComponent id="4"></MyComponent>
   </div>
  </MyComponent>
 </div>
</MyComponent>
 Basically what I need, is a way to traverse the tree of MyComponents (traversal is logically controlled). I can pass control/parameters to the parent component, or have the parent component pass control/parameters to children components in a predefined order (based on data). I have two methods to do this, both involve preprocessors. One is a preprocessor that generates a new Component for each MyComponent found, with some boilerplate. Something like: var MyComponent_1 = React.createClass({
  initialState: function(){ return {currentObject: 0} },
  parentCallback: function(x){ /* traversal logic */ },
  render: function(){
    var nodes=[];
    for(var i=0;i<RepeatParam;i++) nodes.push((<div><MyComponent_2 parent={parent}></MyComponent_2></div>));
    return nodes; 
  }
});

var MyComponent_2 /** just like the above */
 Another method was to add function closures, something like this: var $parent=0, parent=0; (function(){parent=$parent;$parent=1; return ( (function(){parent=$parent;$parent=2; })() }))() Yet another method was to use global variables and inject them into the createClass All of these methods seem wrong, and as if I have a very big misunderstanding of how React should work. Is there a more elegant way to be able to traverse the tree of components, and what is the anti-pattern I am committing; how should I be doing this?
@CODE:<MyComponent id="1>
 <div>
  <MyComponent id="2">
   <div>
    <MyComponent id="3"></MyComponent>
   </div>
   <div>
    <MyComponent id="4"></MyComponent>
   </div>
  </MyComponent>
 </div>
</MyComponent> var MyComponent_1 = React.createClass({
  initialState: function(){ return {currentObject: 0} },
  parentCallback: function(x){ /* traversal logic */ },
  render: function(){
    var nodes=[];
    for(var i=0;i<RepeatParam;i++) nodes.push((<div><MyComponent_2 parent={parent}></MyComponent_2></div>));
    return nodes; 
  }
});

@TITLE:How to migrate this code for Django-registration to version 1.0 of the module?
@CONTENT:I have a Django application running an older version Django-Registration. In that application, I'm overriding the normal registration form with a custom one that I have created like so: from myApp.forms import extendedRegistrationForm

# using my registration form to override the default
url (
    r'^accounts/register/$', 
    'registration.views.register',
    {
        'form_class': extendedRegistrationForm,
        'backend': 'registration.backends.default.DefaultBackend',
    }
),    
 It works fine. However, I am now migrating to the current version of Django-registration which I'm told does not have a view named registration.views.register. Instead it has a class-based view RegistrationView. So I get the following error: Could not import registration.views.register. View does not exist in module registration.views.
 Can someone show me how to adapt my code above to work with RegistrationView?
@CODE:from myApp.forms import extendedRegistrationForm

# using my registration form to override the default

    r'^accounts/register/$',

@CONTENT:A lot of the information on designing strong indices recommends not using them on fields with extremely little data repetition. However, since time-based conditions are a big part of our application people have recommended using an index on the timestamp field to improve query speed. Is it worth the resource cost to add an index for an INT field storing the unix epoch? The timestamps are essentially never the same, aside from when multiple records are stored at the same second.

@TITLE:WinAPI: OpenProcess() returns error 5 with SeDebugPrivilege enabled for host process
@CONTENT:I've got a routine where I process-walk to obtain the HANDLE of each process as I 'walk' down the list (which works fine), but my issue lies when I do: HANDLE h = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, pe32.th32ProcessID) where PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS is the access token, handle inheritance is set to FALSE, and pe32 is a PROCESSENTRY32 GetLastError() returns error code 5, and all the handles that are made are addresses which do not correspond to any appropriate process in Spy++32/64 (I've tried building the application under both platform targets, but as you'd expect, the result is the same). The code for setting SeDebugPrivilege for the host process which I'm using is: BOOL EnableDebugPrivilege(BOOL bEnable)
{
    HANDLE hToken = nullptr;
    LUID luid;

    if (!OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES, &hToken)) return FALSE;
    if (!LookupPrivilegeValue(NULL, SE_DEBUG_NAME, &luid)) return FALSE;

    TOKEN_PRIVILEGES tokenPriv;
    tokenPriv.PrivilegeCount = 1;
    tokenPriv.Privileges[0].Luid = luid;
    tokenPriv.Privileges[0].Attributes = bEnable ? SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED : 0;

    if (!AdjustTokenPrivileges(hToken, FALSE, &tokenPriv, sizeof(TOKEN_PRIVILEGES), NULL, NULL)) return FALSE;

    return TRUE;
}
 Some questions that would be helpful to you: I'm running Windows 7 x64 Professional. Yes, devenv.exe is started with "Run as Administrator" privileges, which means that the debugger and the application itself are started under the same affinity. I have tried toggling UAC or running the application with UAC off altogether. Still error code 5. I just attempted doing it with PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION and I receive error code 6, or ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE. Also attempted with PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ, result is error 5 again. SeDebugPrivilege is enabled, verified with SysInternals' Process Explorer. Additionally, all processes that spawn from devenv/whatever the debugger is called inherit SeDebugPrivilege so...this is weird. Thank you all very much for your time, I'm reaching wits end with this issue :S

@CONTENT:In order to get... void MinPriority::createArray(string targetVertex, Graph & graph)

 what would i put into /*...*/ to get createArray to work? Here is a rough example of what class Graph looks like: class Graph

@CONTENT:Sorl thumbnail has a low-level API that allows you to do, for example: from sorl.thumbnail import get_thumbnail
im = get_thumbnail(my_file, '100x100', crop='center', quality=99)
 This returns a reference to the cached file. If it's already been created, it's super quick. However, if it has to create it for the first time it can take a long time when using remote storage such as S3. Is there a way to run a command in Python (ie. not in a template) to check if sorl will have to generate a thumbnail for the first time? PS. I'm aware of similar question here but this is asking about it in a template context, and has a hacky solution as an answer that uses custom SQL and not the sorl API.

@TITLE:Sendkeys Powershell not working properly
@CONTENT:Is there another way to send keystrokes to an application? I have this Powershell script, after pressing the backtick key a console should open in the application but this doesn't happen, but pressing the keyboard the phisical way it works perfectly. After I open the console by myself the sendkeys do work but the first sendkeys (backtick) doesn't work. What i need is that the script opens the console by sending the backtick key.     # startpwsscrip.ps1

@TITLE:ThreeJS: Best approach to create an animated 2d segmented donut/ring
@CONTENT:This is the object I'm using to create a donut with segments that can be animated. There is a method to pass in an array of values to update the segments which then "tweens" to the new values by recreating the widget a bunch of times. UPDATE 12/21 This method is causing a memory leak/garbage collection issues. Is there a more performant/efficient method to accomplishing this? The memory leak was a seperate issue that was resolved. This post is primarily about finding a more efficient way to generate and animate the geometry for this mesh. donut = function(values, inner_radius, outer_radius) {

    var _inner_radius = inner_radius;
    var _outer_radius = outer_radius;
    var _cur_angle = 0.0;

            });

            for (var each = 0; each < geometry_for_deletion.length; ++each) {
                geometry_for_deletion[each].parent.remove(geometry_for_deletion[each]);

@CONTENT:I Have Created a Simple form in which i have added Adobe Reader from toolbox using steps right click in toolbox - Choose Items choose COM Components tab and there "Adobe PDF Reader" Now Drag&Drop the Adobe PDF Reader Control into an UserControl I have successfully added this, opened up a pdf file also. Now it automatically provides with vertical scrollbars for scrolling through the pdf document. What i want to achieve is instead of using the given scrollbars or mouse to scroll, i want to use a button to scroll scroll the pdf, So there will be two buttons, One for Scroll Up And the other for scroll down. I have gone through many forums, pages, etc. Havnt found anythn that i could use. I have Tried Simulating key presses with SendKeys.Send("{DOWN}");
 But as i press the button, the focus is lost on the adobe reader so it doesnt work Pls help me... I have spent almost half a day searchin for a solution

@LINK:/questions/20722294/php-get-corresponding-data-with-default-and-error-handling
@TITLE:PHP Get corresponding data, with default and error handling
@CONTENT:I have a normal HTML menu that passes a GET statement to the url. <li><a href="?Page=Home">Home</a></li>
 Just like this, al though this is ofcourse only 1 item of the entire menu. In a seperated file I have an function that checks if an GET or POST statement exist, and If it exist and is not NULL then it will give the value back to where it was called. public function getFormVariable($value){

    switch (strtoupper($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'])) {
        case 'GET':
            if (isset($_GET[$value]) && $_GET[$value] != NULL) {
                return $_GET[$value];
            }
            else{
                return false;
            }
            break;
            case 'POST':
                if (isset($POST[$value]) && $POST[$value] != NULL) {
                return $POST[$value];
            }
            else{
                    return false;
            }
                break;

        default:
            return false;

    }
}
 And with the following code it takes the get value and finds the corrosponding class (every class is in a seperated file, and every class is 1 link in my menu) In this class there is just some regular functions/data that gives the content of that page. $class = loadClass($ConfigPage->getFormVariable('Page'));
        $ConfigPage->SetProperty('content', $class);

        function loadClass($Page){
            $class_name = 'Content' . $Page;

            if(!class_exists($class_name)){
                return 'Error: Content has not been found.';
            }

            $class = new $class_name();
            return $class;
        }
 Explaining: The menu gives a GET value of 'Contact' which is then check by GetFormVariable() and then the corresponding class is found which gives back the content that class holds. Now my question: When the function LoadClass() cant find the name of the class it was given through the GET statement, it should return a error string. But this is not happening. I get a beautiful big orange error from PHP saying the following: Fatal error: Call to a member function render() on a non-object in E:\Program files\wamp\www\BDW\Class\Html_Page.Class.php on line 147 Line 147 is where to object is called echo $this->content->render(); The Render function is as it says a normal return function inside the content classes. Why do i get this error, and how do i fix it? Second question. If there is no GET statement in the url. It gives the exact same error. which is pretty logical. But how do i make it show ContentHome when there is no GET statement in the url, and an ERROR when the value of the GET statement is incorrect. Thank you for reading, If there is anything unclear please tell me. English is not my native language, and after all. I am here to learn. EDIT: My knowledge of PHP is not great enough, so i decided when a class can not be found. it brings you back to home without any error. which i wanted in the first place. Here is my new code which is still not working, why? $class = loadClass($ConfigPage->getFormVariable('Page'));
        $ConfigPage->SetProperty('content', $class);

        function loadClass($Page){
            $class_name = 'Content' . $Page;
            $Default_Class = 'ContentHome';

            if(!class_exists($class_name)){
                //echo 'Error: Content has not been found.';
                $class = new $Default_Class();

@TITLE:Chrome text rendering when using transforms on parent element
@CONTENT:I have a very simple transform on div element. Inside of it is few lines of text. Text renders fine on Firefox and IE, but it is not looking good in Chrome. I tried changing -webkit-font-smoothing, but that didn't help either. .text-holder{position: absolute;top: 0;width: 30rem;height: 20rem;margin-right:   auto;margin-left: auto;left: 0;right: 0;-webkit-transform:rotate(-4.6deg);-moz-   transform:rotate(-4.6deg); transform: rotate(-4.6deg);}
 Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FFA6b/
@CODE:.text-holder{position: absolute;top: 0;width: 30rem;height: 20rem;margin-right:   auto;margin-left: auto;left: 0;right: 0;-webkit-transform:rotate(-4.6deg);-moz-   transform:rotate(-4.6deg); transform: rotate(-4.6deg);}

@TITLE:FB native login SessionState CLOSED_LOGIN_FAILED
@CONTENT:I know there are couple of other questions like this, but nothing worked from there. The code is from here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/login-with-facebook There are not modifications. When i am logging FB always returns CLOSED_LOGIN_FAILED. I generated Key Hash with this: keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64 and checked it with this: try {
        PackageInfo info = getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(
                "com.example.facebooktest", PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);
        for (Signature signature : info.signatures) {
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
            md.update(signature.toByteArray());
            String s = Base64.encodeToString(md.digest(), Base64.DEFAULT);
            Log.d("KeyHash:", s);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
    }
 So the problem is not with the key. I have checked and double checked everything but i still don't know from where is the problem coming. I tried all the sample apps that come with the SDK and all of them return the same thing. Also i tried it on 3 different devices same problem. Can anyone help?
@CODE:try {
        PackageInfo info = getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(
                "com.example.facebooktest", PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);
        for (Signature signature : info.signatures) {
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
            md.update(signature.toByteArray());
            String s = Base64.encodeToString(md.digest(), Base64.DEFAULT);
            Log.d("KeyHash:", s);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {

@TITLE:Use object properties in LongListSelector (XAML)
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the LongListSelector to show a list of notes in my WP8 application. I use a list of Note (Note is my object name) and Note has two properties : Titre and Contenu. Simply, I want to display the Titre property of my object in my LongListSelector. I have this code : ListeNotes.ItemsSource = ListNotes (because ListNotes is my List's name and ListeNotes is my LongListSelector's name). But it shows a list containing only CloudyNote.Note the number of time I have notes. How could I do to show the Title property instead of the object name in my LongListSelector ? Thank you in advance.

@LINK:/questions/20719382/tommahawk-myfaces-and-cdi
@TITLE:Tommahawk Myfaces and CDI
@CONTENT:I'm having some problems using CDI with Tommahawk Myfaces when trying to create a JSF page to upload a file. Referring to this question it looks as though Tommahawk MyFaces isn't compatible with CDI but is this correct? My Bean is like this: @ManagedBean
@RequestScoped
public class Bean {
private UploadedFile uploadedFile;

public void submit() throws IOException {
    String fileName = FilenameUtils.getName(uploadedFile.getName());
    String contentType = uploadedFile.getContentType();
    byte[] bytes = uploadedFile.getBytes();

    // Now you can save bytes in DB (and also content type?)

    FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().addMessage(null, 
        new FacesMessage(String.format("File '%s' of type '%s' successfully uploaded!", fileName, contentType)));
    }

    public UploadedFile getUploadedFile() {
        return uploadedFile;
    }

    public void setUploadedFile(UploadedFile uploadedFile) {
        this.uploadedFile = uploadedFile;
    }
}
 But as soon as I replace @ManagedBean and @RequestScoped with @Named or @Model I get the following warning when deploying: WELD-001529 An InjectionTarget implementation is created for a class org.apache.myfaces.webapp.filter.TomahawkFacesContextFactory which does not have any appropriate constructor. And when I upload a file with the following JSF page, the value of UploadedFile is null when I use @Named or @Model. but not with @ManagedBean' and@RequestScope. This is the.xhtml` file and I do use tommahawk Myfaces: <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

    xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
    xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
    xmlns:t="http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk"
    xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
    <h:head>
        <title>Tomahawk file upload demo</title>
    </h:head>
    <h:body>
        <h:form enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <t:inputFileUpload value="#{bean.uploadedFile}" />
            <h:commandButton value="submit" action="#{bean.submit()}" />
            <h:messages />
        </h:form>
    </h:body>
</html>
 So I assume CDI does not like the tomahawk library as there is no default constructor?

    FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().addMessage(null,

    }

    public UploadedFile getUploadedFile() {
        return uploadedFile;
    }

    public void setUploadedFile(UploadedFile uploadedFile) {
        this.uploadedFile = uploadedFile;
    }
} @ManagedBean @RequestScoped @Named @Model UploadedFile @Named @Model @ManagedBean' and . This is the <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>

@TITLE:GWT - Serialize as superclass
@CONTENT:I am trying to send a Game object from the server to the client in GWT. This Game object simply contains a list of Player: public class Game implements Serializable {
    private List<Player> players;
}
 A Player is a simple Pojo that contains the player's state, like the name, remaining life, etc. public class Player implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int numberOfGamesPlayed;
    private double hp, initialHp;
}
 However, the game can also contain a CpuPlayer, that is a Player with additional Artificial Intelligence logic public class CpuPlayer extends Player {
    private PlayerIntelligence intelligence; // Not serializable
}
 Both the Game and Player objects are in my "shared" package, and should be used on server and client side. However, the CpuPlayer contains many internal processing data, and is purely server-side. It is therefore not included in GWT serialization whitelist. What I would like to do is to send the CpuPlayer as a Player to the client, i.e. mask all the subclass specificities during the serialization. Is this approach sound? Is there a way to do that? I looked at custom serialization, but it didn't seem to work that way (I would need to serialize all the fields one by one). Thanks for your help, S?bastien

@TITLE:chef versioning - is there an order of precedence?
@CONTENT:As i understand it, you can set the version for a cookbook in its metadata.rb file. You can subsequently reference that version in three places. Other cookbook metadata, environments or run_lists. What happens if you specify a version constraint for the same cookbook in more than one of those locations with different version numbers. Which version is enforced? The reason for asking is if a Role isn't versioned like a cookbook... and maybe the production environment is configured to lock versions to known good cookbooks but an admin comes along and updates a recipe in the Roles run_list like apache@1.2.2 so it's different to that of the environments constraints.. which wins. Hope that makes sense. fLo

@TITLE:¡§import and using may not appear after a type declaration¡¨ ¡X the haxe using magic
@CONTENT:I am trying to add an less-than-or-equal-to method (non-intrusively) to basic types such as Int, Float or existing/library types that I cannot change. (see my other question how to write a generic compare function in Haxe (haxe3)) I read that the "using" keyword is the way to do it. What I intend to do is this: class IntOrder {
    static public function le(x:Int,y:Int):Bool { return x <= y; }
}
class FloatOrder {
    static public function le(x:Float,y:Float):Bool { return x <= y; }
}
class StringOrder {
    static public function le(x:String,y:String):Bool {... }
}
//...Other classes

using IntOrder;
using FloatOrder;
using StringOrder;
//... Other using statements

class Main {
    @:generic static public function compare_<A:{function le(y:A):Bool;}>(x:A,y:A): Int {
        if (x.le(y) && y.le(x)) return 0;
        else if (x.le(y)) return -1;
        else se return 1;
    }
}
 Now haxe3.01 is giving an error: import and using may not appear after a type declaration. I understand that using is a kind of special import statement, so probably one can't import inside the same file where the declaration is made. My questions are: 1) in a use-case like this one, do I have to create a three-line file for each of the XXXOrder classes? This is rather a pain to maintain. 2) even if I create separate .hx files for each XXXOrder class, will the same function name (e.g. le) cause name clashes. 3) Is there a way to work around the using keyword (maybe using callback??) so that these extender classes can be hold in one file? Thanks in advance. --- Update --- I tried moving using statements before the class definitions as suggested in the answer. Now compiler is not complaining about the using statement. But it's complaining about type check failure. using Main.IntOrder;
using Main.FloatOrder;
using Main.StringOrder;

class IntOrder {
    static public function le(x:Int,y:Int):Bool { return x <= y; }
}

        else return 1;
    }
    static public function main() {

    }
}

@TITLE:Play wav / mp3 output from TTS with mediacontroller
@CONTENT:I am trying to output an MP3 or wav from TTS in android which then plays back via mediaplayer. The TTS output to file works well and the mp3 file is available on the sdcard at the following location: /sdcard/tmp/tmp.mp3 The problem I have is the audio file will only play once, if the user reselects the "Play" button then the file doesnt play. The second problem I have is that the media controller isnt showing while the file is playing / user touches the screen. The important parts of the code are below:    //audio file playback here
    public MediaPlayer mediaPlayer;
    public MediaController mediaController;
    private Handler handler = new Handler();

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

       //mediaplayer stuff

        mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
        mediaPlayer.setOnPreparedListener(this);

        mediaController = new MediaController(this);
}
 The play button onclick looks like this:  String text = inputText.getText().toString();
                    if (text!=null && text.length()>0) {
                //  tts.speak(text, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_ADD, null);

                    myHashRender.put(TextToSpeech.Engine.KEY_PARAM_UTTERANCE_ID, text);
                    String tempDestFile = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath()+"/tmp/tmp.wav";
                    tts.synthesizeToFile(text, myHashRender, tempDestFile);
                    //todo hand to media player for play pause etc

 Finally the ouTouchEvent is here:  public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent me) {
            mediaController.show();
            return gDetector.onTouchEvent(me);

            }
 Logcat would seem to suggest the mediaplayer is being released after the file is played and is ready to play again, this is the logcat output when i try to play the file twice: 12-21 08:39:18.025: V/MediaPlayer-JNI(26717): isPlaying: 1

 In summary my 2 questions are: Why does the audio only play once and not each time the Play ImageButton is pressed? EDIT: Thanks to the part answer below by Dave the media now plays each time the user presses the play button. The mediacontrols still are not showing on touch though. How should I modify my code so the mediacontrols show standard play pause stop seek etc? Thanks for the help, this is my first attempt with mediaplayer in android; Andy

@TITLE:how to use javascript to detect whether a web page is responsive on mobile
@CONTENT:I need to use javascript to detect whether a page is responsive. On a galaxy note 3, here are the values for a non-responsive and a responsive pages: non-responsive: 
window.innerWidth:980 
clientWidth:980 
screen.width:640 

responsive: 
window.innerWidth:640 
clientWidth:640 
screen.width:640 
 So is it correct to say that if clientWidth == screen.width then it is responsive, else it is non-responsive?
@CODE:non-responsive: 
window.innerWidth:980 
clientWidth:980 
screen.width:640 

responsive: 
window.innerWidth:640 
clientWidth:640 
screen.width:640 clientWidth == screen.width

@LINK:/questions/20716753/how-can-i-get-the-ios-status-bar-to-overlay-the-app-surface-rather-than-pushin
@TITLE:How can I get the iOS status bar to *overlay* the app surface rather than pushing it down?
@CONTENT:I am developing a Phonegap app for iOS (and others). The view is landscape only. I am using Phonegap Build with PG 3.1. I am testing on an iPad3 with iOS7. I need a solution that works not just on iOS7, but also a couple of versions back. In the Xcode iPad emulator, the app uses the entire screen. The status bar is transparent and overlaid on top of the app. However, when I test the app on my iPad, the status bar isn't transparent anymore, and pushes the app down 20px, which means the bottom 20px disappear. For this particular app, it would be much better if the top was overlaid, so that the important bottom part of the app wasn't pushed out of view. So the question is: Can I either make the status bar disappear completely, or can I make it transparent and overlaid? I have tried the Status Bar plugin for Phonegap, but it doesn't seem to work properly. I used StatusBar.hide() in my deviceReady function, but the bar remained in view. And worse, the right-hand part of the screen became completely unresponsive to touch events. As if there was a transparent overlay on that part of the screen, possibly related to this bug. As described there, the overlay isn't transparent though, but it seems to cover exactly the same area that goes unresponsive in my case.

 The above code doesn't calculate all 4 computed fields, just one for now. The problem I am having is that I have 24000 rows and 12 columns in my input sheet and it is taking a lot of time to just copy this data to the output sheet and then doing calculations on it to compute one more value.And I have to calculate 3 more fields from one longitude value. So if you guys could take a look at the code and let me know how i could go about minimizing the runtime here, that would help a lot.

@TITLE:Connection pooling in java using c3p0
@CONTENT:I want to using c3p0 for connection pooling in none-web application java program that i wrote. I used traditional singleton connection and I am not satisfied with its performance, so I decided to go for connection pooling. I take a look at c3p0 website and here is what they told about using c3p0: ComboPooledDataSource cpds = new ComboPooledDataSource();
cpds.setDriverClass( "org.postgresql.Driver" ); //loads the jdbc driver            
cpds.setJdbcUrl( "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/testdb" );

cpds.setPassword("test-password");                                  

// the settings below are optional -- c3p0 can work with defaults
cpds.setMinPoolSize(5);                                     
cpds.setAcquireIncrement(5);
cpds.setMaxPoolSize(20);

 I want to know how could i use that for ms sql windows authentication connection, but I could not figure it how? Also how can I set my query through that connection? It seems that using connection pooling is a whole different world than traditional database connection and I am new to that. Here is what i figure out: public class DatabaseManager {

    }
    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {

            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        cpds.setJdbcUrl(URL);
        cpds.setUser(UNAME);
        cpds.setPassword(PWD);
        cpds.setMinPoolSize(1000);
        cpds.setAcquireIncrement(1000);
        cpds.setMaxPoolSize(20000);
        return cpds;
    }

@TITLE:POST data using AJAX POST
@CONTENT:Is it possible to post image file using the jQuery's ajax post method. Would it work if I just put the file data in the POST request's 'data' parameter? I am using django framework. This is my first attempt: $('#edit_user_image').change(function(){
    var client = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var file = document.getElementById("edit_user_image");
    var csrftoken = document.getElementsByName('csrfmiddlewaretoken')[0].value
    /* Create a FormData instance */

    var formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("upload", file.files[0]);


    client.open("post", "/upload-image/", true);

    client.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "multipart/form-data; charset=UTF-8; boundary=frontier");
    client.send(formData);  /* Send to server */ 
  });
 The problem with this is that I don't get the'request.FILES' object on the serer side in my 'views.py'. I also tried doing it with ajax post but it doesn't work either. $('#edit_user_image').change(function(){

 Without pyOpenSSL, dummy clients and the server work well. Applying pyOpenSSL causes unexpected problems :(. If you have encountered the problems or have solutions to the problems, please let me know. .... If there's no solutions to the error, I'd rather find out other alternatives not using OpenSSL.. Or do you know any alterntives which can encrypt/decrypt chatting messages and personal files transfered between machines? Though I already stored data to be sent in a local variable before writing(sending) the data, the error happens everytime.

@TITLE:Login page goes to main UITabBar view even with incorrect login info
@CONTENT:Ok so I'm linked to a server and I know for a fact that I have all the code there correct. But something seems to be wrong with this code: -(void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection {
    NSString* responseString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:_responseData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    /*Succesful Login*/
    if([responseString isEqualToString:@"success"]){

        NSLog(@"Succesful login.");

        NSLog(@"Incorrect username and (or) password.");
    }

    /*GET request*/
    else if([responseString isEqualToString:@"get"]){

    }
}
 So I think you can ignore the 2nd and 4th else if's but here's the problem: When I try a user and pass that I know does not exist in the server, it still segues me to the main tab bar view. Am I supposed to reload the login page's view for the "incorrect" logic, or is my segue wrong? P.S. The segue is simply linked from a login button to the main tab bar view, and is modal. Also, I keep getting this error message in the debugger: "Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions for ." Any help is greatly appreciated, Thanks!

@LINK:/questions/20715249/angulars-routing-hides-404-responses-for-nonexistent-routes
@TITLE:Angular's routing hides 404 responses for nonexistent routes
@CONTENT:I have noticed that GET requests for nonexistent paths don't return a 404 response. Instead, the client gets a "200 Ok", Angular renders the main view, and rewrites the path to /. A request for a nonsense URI is logged as successful in the server logs. If I understand correctly, the problem is that since Angular handles routing, the server has to accept a GET request for any URI and always respond by serving the client side of the app ("200 Ok" or "304 Not Modified"). For example, using the project scaffolded by the angular-fullstack Yeoman generator, requesting a nonexistent /unicorn goes like this: GET /unicorn 200 31ms - 3.29kb
GET /partials/main 304 36ms
GET /api/awesomeThings 304 5ms
 The Express route that handles the request looks like this: // server, last route:
app.get('*', controllers.index);

// controllers:
exports.index = function(req, res) {
  res.render('index');

@TITLE:How to view NFC tag object in raw format
@CONTENT:I read about the Tag object in the NFC basics of Android API guide. I then added this enter link description here project to my Eclipse environment, and can run it on Samsung Note. I now want to view the Tag object that is created in the code. I have marked the code I have added to the existing code. I am not sure if did it correctly. Is there anyway I can see what is inside of the Tag object I have in the code? I did try adding a breakpoint, and looked at what I have in variables, but I don't see a variable called tag. Here is the code from the source: @Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    Log.d(TAG, "onCreate");

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    // initialize NFC
    nfcAdapter = NfcAdapter.getDefaultAdapter(this);
    nfcPendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, new Intent(this, this.getClass()).addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP), 0);

    // Register Android Beam callback
    nfcAdapter.setNdefPushMessageCallback(this, this);
    // Register callback to listen for message-sent success
    nfcAdapter.setOnNdefPushCompleteCallback(this, this);
    /***********************************

@TITLE:Convoluted comparisons and exclusions inside a single MySQL table
@CONTENT:MySQLfiddle here: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/6094e8/6 The fiddle contains the data that goes along with my examples below. I have a single table I am trying to work with: Table 1: user_answers table (stores users answers and their acceptable asnwers to various questions) The notable values that are stored are: users id (column uid) question id for the question they are answering (column quid) answer to the question (column answer) acceptable answer storage #1 stores other acceptable answers for that user (column acceptable_1) acceptable answer storage #2 stores other acceptable answers for that user (column acceptable_2) acceptable answer storage #3 stores other acceptable answers for that user (column acceptable_3) acceptable answer storage #4 stores other acceptable answers for that user (column acceptable_4) importance of their answer (column importance) The answer column will store a value between 1 and 4. The acceptable columns hold selected acceptable answers which are in line with their column placement. For example, user 1 answers 1, but would accept answers 2 and 3. This would make acceptable_2 = 2 and acceptable_3 = 3, leaving acceptable_1 and acceptable_2 with a value of 0. For the sake of example I'll try and explain the results I am looking for: Example 1: User 1 answers 3 on quid 1 and would accept answers 2 and 4 from another user for that same question. User 2 answers 2 on quid 1 and would accept answers 3 from another user for that same question Result for Example 1: User 1 would accept user 2's answer and user 2 would accept accept user 1's answer. This result should be excluded from the results. Example 2: User 1 answers 2 on quid 2 and would accept answers 1 or 4 from another user for that same question. User 2 answers 2 on quid 2 and would accept answers 2 or 4 from another user for that same question. Result for Example 2: User 1 would not accept user 2's answer, but user 2 would accept user 1's answer. This comparison has a single conflict in it and should be included in the results. Example 3: User 1 answers 1 on quid 3 and would accept answers 1 or 2 from another user for that same question. User 2 answers 1 on quid 3 and would accept answers 1 or 2 from another user for that same question. Result for Example 3: User 1 would accept user 2's answer and user 2 would accept user 1's answer. There is no conflict and this result should be excluded from the results. Example 4: User 1 answers 1 on quid 4 and would accept answers 1 or 2 from another user for that same question. User 2 answers 3 on quid 4 and would accept answers 3 or 4 from another user for that same question. Result for Example 4: User 1 would not accept user 2's answer and user 2 would not accept user 1's answer. There are two conflicts and this result should be included in the results. As I hope is visible, I would like to grab the quid for the questions both users have answered which have conflict in their answers in terms of what is in the other users acceptable columns. So far I have been able to gather the answers and acceptable answers for each user using this query: select ua.quid,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,answer,'') SEPARATOR '') as a1,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=2,answer,'') SEPARATOR '') as a2,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,acceptable_1,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac1_1,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,acceptable_2,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac2_1,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,acceptable_3,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac3_1,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,acceptable_4,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac4_1,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=2,acceptable_1,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac1_2,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=2,acceptable_2,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac2_2,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=2,acceptable_3,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac3_2,
       GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=2,acceptable_4,'') SEPARATOR '') as ac4_2
from user_answers ua
where importance <> 1 and uid in (1, 2)
group by ua.quid
having sum(uid = 1) > 0 and
       sum(uid = 2) > 0
 Not being able to use the aliases I use to house the acceptable answers for each user in my WHERE clause (ac1_1, etc), I have yet to successfully compare all the variables to get the expected results. Any guidance appreciated.
@CODE:uid quid answer acceptable_1 acceptable_2 acceptable_3 acceptable_4 importance acceptable_2 = 2 acceptable_3 = 3 acceptable_1 acceptable_2 quid select ua.quid,

@TITLE:Stop History.js from changing the address URL
@CONTENT:I've been experimenting with History.js lately (https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/). I notice when you use the History.pushState(), History.js removes everything upto the first / and replaces that with the hash. I.E. current url: www.google.com/something History.pushState({},null,"something2");
 sets the address bar to www.google.com/something2 whereas in HTML4 it would use the hash (#) -> www.google.com/something#something2 Is there anyway to disable this feature. I'l like it to not remove everything up to the '/', but without necessarily going back to HTML4. I know there's a History.options.html4Mode, but I still like how it stores the index internally, as opposed to using the suid.

@TITLE:Vaadin 7 : TableFieldFactory
@CONTENT:Is there a way to implent TableFactory interface with specific fields related to propertyId ? I only get one type of field since i'm using a generic class for all my tables, and the i'm missing CheckBox boolean value (groovy code): class DefaultTableFieldFactory implements TableFieldFactory {
    @Override
    public Field<?> createField(Container container, Object itemId, Object propertyId, Component component) {
        TextField t = new TextField()

        switch(propertyId) {
            case "firstname": t.setNullRepresentation("");
            case "lastname": t.setNullRepresentation("");
            case "mobile": t.setNullRepresentation("");
            case "tel": t.setNullRepresentation("");
            case "email": t.setNullRepresentation("");
            default: break;
        }
        t.setWidth("95px")

        return t
    }
}
 So i need to use this class above which implments DefaultTableFieldfactory in order to have the null representation as "" (instead of "null" ) in my whole application. The goal is to provide for my custom components (more than 30) this null representation in a single place, I want to use this class as my default factory for every table, and connect it like i've done before: def contacts = (Grails.get(FundService)).getAllContacts(fundId)
        def cContainer = new BeanItemContainer<Contact>(Contact.class,contacts)


        def t = new Table()
        t.containerDataSource = cContainer
        t.setTableFieldFactory(new DefaultTableFieldFactory())
@CODE:class DefaultTableFieldFactory implements TableFieldFactory {
    @Override
    public Field<?> createField(Container container, Object itemId, Object propertyId, Component component) {
        TextField t = new TextField()

        switch(propertyId) {

            default: break;
        }
        t.setWidth("95px")

        return t
    }
} def contacts = (Grails.get(FundService)).getAllContacts(fundId)
        def cContainer = new BeanItemContainer<Contact>(Contact.class,contacts)


        def t = new Table()

 I am able to hit the service from soapui but not from the sample java code I wrote. Could some one please point me to why this is happening and how I can resolve this? Should we have received some security certificates from the 3'rd party wsdl folks?

@LINK:/questions/20712242/product-compare-session
@TITLE:Product compare session
@CONTENT:I am working on a project which require ability to compare 2 or more products. And the client required an ability for a page which links directly to such comparison. The way I opted to implement it was with URL lik this: /compare?id=5-20-100 (for comparing products wit IDs 5, 20 and 100). Basically the whole thing gets parsed by this script: $list = explode( '-', $_GET['id'] );

$myarray = $list;

$args = array(
   'post_type' => 'products',
   'post__in'      => $myarray
);
// The Query
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args );
 For adding products to the list I intend to use a session, where items are added in via AJAX (I'm using jQuery, is that matters). So, the problem I got is this: When user clicks on "compare this product", I need get this product's ID (probably from html data attribute product-id="100"). How to set up this AJAX session? More precisely: how, when user's click "compare Items" button, do I make them go to /compare?id=5-20-100 URL? Front-end update: <a href="#" data-id="5">Product 1 add to compare</a>
<a href="#" data-id="20">Product 2 add to compare</a>
 View compare products, in this part i need get url from ajax session. <a href="compare?id=5-20">View compare products</a>
@CODE:/compare?id=5-20-100 $list = explode( '-', $_GET['id'] );

$myarray = $list;

$args = array(
   'post_type' => 'products',
   'post__in'      => $myarray
);
// The Query
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args ); product-id="100" /compare?id=5-20-100 <a href="#" data-id="5">Product 1 add to compare</a>
<a href="#" data-id="20">Product 2 add to compare</a> <a href="compare?id=5-20">View compare products</a>

@TITLE:rufus scheduler running twice each time
@CONTENT:Maybe it's my task, maybe it's my scheduler, but for some reason my scheduled task is running twice or saving two versions to the DB. Here's my code: report.rb:   def record_page_stats!
    oauth = Koala::Facebook::OAuth.new
    @api = Koala::Facebook::API.new oauth.get_app_access_token
    @fb_page = @api.get_object(self.fb_page_id)
    self.page_stats.new(like_count: @fb_page["likes"], talking_about_count: @fb_page["talking_about_count"])
    self.save
  end
 AND the scheduler.rb: require 'rufus-scheduler'

scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new

scheduler.every '10m' do
  Report.where(tracking_page: true).each do |report|
    report.record_page_stats!
  end
end
 am i missing something really obvious? here's the output from the database of the saved page stats: 2013-12-20 18:43:06 UTC = 8304 likes and 229 talking about count 
2013-12-20 18:43:08 UTC = 8304 likes and 229 talking about count

2013-12-20 19:33:32 UTC = 8304 likes and 229 talking about count 
 as you can see by the timestamp, it runs twice every 10 minutes EDIT: I just looked at the data again...and the scheduler has changed timing a few times: first, it ran the job twice in a row, each 10 minutes then, it switched to once per 10 minutes then, it switched to once per 5 minutes then, it switched to twice per 5 minutes EDIT 2: new output after locking: 2013-12-20 22:14:22 UTC = 176155 likes and 5757 talking about count 
2013-12-20 22:14:24 UTC = 176155 likes and 6994 talking about count 
 My file now looks like this: require 'rufus-scheduler'

scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new(:lockfile => ".rufus-scheduler.lock")

scheduler.every '10m' do
  Report.where(tracking_page: true).each do |report|
    report.record_page_stats!
  end
  log "started Scheduler #{scheduler.object_id}"
end

@TITLE:Can I use MinGW compiled Python extensions together with Visual C++ compiled ones?
@CONTENT:Having trouble compiling a Python extension under Windows, I've asked a question.One of the answers does not answer my question but is worth asking as a question on its own. Given a Visual C++ compiled Python distribution under Windows, would I have any problems if I use Visual C++ compiled extensions along with MinGW compiled ones? This would allow me resort to MinGW when it is easier than configuring MS compiler.

@TITLE:ContentPresenter is not showing Content from my UserControl
@CONTENT:I have a Window called SelectScreenShots that contains a Button and a ContentPresenter. I want to display a list of images and buttons in that Content Presenter through a user control, but when I load the program, nothing shows up.

@TITLE:Typeclass representing functions
@CONTENT:Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but is there a typeclass that represents all functions? Like, lets say I have a type like this data Foo a = Thing a 

instance (Show a) => Show (Foo a) where
    show (Thing a) = show a
 And I want to display Thing (\x -> 1). Maybe do some sort o reflection on the method to pretty print some metadata about this? Trying it I get the following error > Thing (\x -> 1)

<interactive>:113:1:
    No instance for (Show (t0 -> a0)) arising from a use of `print'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (t0 -> a0))
    In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it

<interactive>:113:14:
    No instance for (Num a0) arising from the literal `1'
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Num Double -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Num Float -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Integral a => Num (GHC.Real.Ratio a)
        -- Defined in `GHC.Real'
      ...plus 11 others
    In the expression: 1
    In the first argument of `Thing', namely `(\ x -> 1)'
    In the expression: Thing (\ x -> 1)
 Which makes sense, since there is no instance of show for t0 -> a0 but I am not sure how to describe an instance of this typeclass? This isn't for anything production, I am just messing around with Haskell and curious what I can and can't do.
@CODE:data Foo a = Thing a

@TITLE:IIS or IIS_IUSRS permisions so that PHP can write files for WordPress
@CONTENT:I'm running IIS 8 on a virtual machine (Windows Server 2012 Datacenter) in Azure. I have installed WordPress and its dependencies using the Web Platform Installer 4.6 I have trouble when WordPress needs to write files from its admin console. I've added the ftp details to the file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\blog\wp-config.php and that works fine. But whenever WordPress tries to write a file from its management web page, for example to create a child theme or to upload media I got an error (e.g. 'failed to upload due to an error' or 'Target child theme directory cannot be created. This is probably a permission error'.) I can fix this using EvilDr's idea of adding permissions to the IUSR account. But I am nervous about this since it seems that IUSR and should only have access to precisely what it needs; it should never be given access to anything else. Is giving IUSR read Modify, Read & execute, List folder contents, Read, and Write permissions for the WordPress directory C:\inetpub\wwwroot\blog and its subfolders the correct and safest way to get WordPress working on IIS 8?

@TITLE:iOS UIStepper & NSUserDefaults - How to manage them together and use a double
@CONTENT:I have the following code. However, the line stepper.value = [NSNumber numberWithDouble:loadNumber];
 errors with the error 'Sending NSNumber *__strong to a parameter of incompatible type 'double''. I think the stepper will only accept a double, but am unsure what I am doing wrong to set it. What I need to achieve is the following:- 1) Have a default value set in NSUserDefaults for saveNumber, which will be used until a variation is made by the user. 2) on load or view appearing, use saveNumber to set the value of both stepper.value and myLabel. 3) ensure that when changed with the stepper, the value is updated in myLabel, and NSUserDefaults saveNumber is also updated. Can anyone advise where I am going wrong, and help correct my code please? Further,I just realised that in the final app, I will have this setting on a different viewController to the one that will use the NSUserDefaults savedNumber value. With this in mind, can you also let me know how to ensure that savedNumber is available not only to this viewController, but any other one I require the values on? Many thanks. - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated

    NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
    NSNumber *loadNumber = [defaults objectForKey:@"saveNumber"];
    self.myLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@",loadNumber];

    [defaults synchronize];

    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] registerDefaults:defaults];
 When the App first launches (and every time after until the stepper has been used) the value being seen is 'null'. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Rails Custom Logger Writes To Log Sporadically
@CONTENT:I've set up a custom logger in an initializer: # /config/initializers/logging.rb

log_file = File.open("#{Example::Application.config.root}/log/app.log", "a")
AppLogger = ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger.new(log_file)
AppLogger.level = Logger::DEBUG
AppLogger.auto_flushing = true
AppLogger.debug "App Logger Up"
 Although it creates the log file when I start the application, it doesn't write to the log file. Either from AppLogger.debug "App Logger Up" in the initializer or similar code elsewhere in the running application. However, intermittently I do find log statements in the file, though seemingly without any pattern. It would seem that it is buffering the log messages and dumping them when it feels like it. However I'm setting auto_flushing to true which should cause it to flush the buffer immediately. What is going on and how can I get it working? Note: Tailing the log with $ tail -f "log/app.log" also doesn't pick up changes. I'm using POW, but I've also tried with WEBrick and get the same (lack of) results.

@LINK:/questions/20706893/spring-cant-find-class-from-shared-gradle-library-dependency-in-autowired-bean
@TITLE:Spring can't find class from shared Gradle library (dependency in autowired bean) when debugging in Eclipse
@CONTENT:Problem Definition I have a Spring MVC project which is Gradle-based. I have a website project (zeario-web), web crawler (zeario-webcrawler), and shared classes (zeario-sharedclientserverclasses). The web and web crawler share some classes (something like DTOs or VOs). In my web app, I have a CrawlerController with a getWorkUnit method; this calls a method on a CrawlerService instance (@Autowired depdency), which, in turn, uses some classes from the shared library. My problem is that I can build and deploy a working version of my web app via Gradle, but not via Eclipse. Eclipse gives me a spring runtime exception about not finding one of the shared classes, and being therefore unable to create/inject the service instance. From the Tomcat logs: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'crawlerController': Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private com.zeario.service.CrawlerService com.zeario.api.v1.controller.CrawlerController.service; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/zeario/api/v1/model/workunit/PageDiscoveryWorkUnit Code Snippets Controller definition (simplified): @Controller
public class CrawlerController {


    @Autowired
    private CrawlerService service;

    // ... methods with @RequestMapping ...
}
 Service class (simplified): @Service
public class CrawlerService {

    public PageDiscoveryWorkUnit getPageDiscoveryWorkUnit() {
        return new PageDiscoveryWorkUnit();
    }
 PageDiscoveryWorkUnit is a simple POJO/Bean class. I have my service beans declared in the spring-servlet.xml file: <bean id="crawlerService" class="com.zeario.service.CrawlerService" />
 Gradle Configuration 1) Root project (empty, no source) defines sub-projects in settings.gradle. Dependencies are in build.gradle: project(':zeario-web') {
    dependencies {
        compile project(':zeario-sharedclientserver')
    }
}

project(':zeario-webcrawler') {
    dependencies {
        compile project(':zeario-sharedclientserver')
    }
}
 2) Projects define dependencies on other projects where applicable. For example, the web project build file contains: dependencies {
    // Guava, Spring MVC, etc. ...
    packed project(':zeario-sharedclientserver') // Shared code
    // ...
}
 Eclipse Configuration When I check build paths, Eclipse correctly shows project dependencies; for example, it shows that the web project has a dependency on the shared client/server project.
@CODE:zeario-web zeario-webcrawler zeario-sharedclientserverclasses CrawlerController getWorkUnit CrawlerService @Autowired @Controller
public class CrawlerController {


    @Autowired
    private CrawlerService service;

    // ... methods with @RequestMapping ...
} @Service
public class CrawlerService {

    public PageDiscoveryWorkUnit getPageDiscoveryWorkUnit() {
        return new PageDiscoveryWorkUnit();
    } PageDiscoveryWorkUnit spring-servlet.xml <bean id="crawlerService" class="com.zeario.service.CrawlerService" /> settings.gradle build.gradle project(':zeario-web') {
    dependencies {
        compile project(':zeario-sharedclientserver')
    }
}

project(':zeario-webcrawler') {
    dependencies {
        compile project(':zeario-sharedclientserver')
    }
} dependencies {
    // Guava, Spring MVC, etc. ...
    packed project(':zeario-sharedclientserver') // Shared code
    // ...
} web shared client/server

@TITLE:How to use Sonatype Nexus Repository Groups with Github raw repositories?
@CONTENT:How can I tell Nexus to download the artifacts from a raw github maven repository when the Proxy Repository in Nexus is in a Repository Group? Background: In our parent-pom we use a catch all mirror, so we don't have to configure each and every repository to the poms. This works flawless and is also common practice - example: <mirrors>
    <mirror>
        <id>provided</id>
        <url>http://nexus.host/content/groups/provided</url>
        <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
</mirrors>
 But when using a raw github repository this dosn't works. How can I configure Nexus to do this? Note: I already read "How to add Github raw repositories to Sonatype Nexus as Proxy repository?", but this doesn't tells you how it would run with Repository Groups. Update: In a manual post step I created the nexus index files with the nexus-indexer-3.0.4-cli.jar, and commited/pushed them to github. Now nexus shows me in the "Browse Index" tab the files in the Proxy Repository, but the problem remains. Clients can not download the artifacts from Nexus.
@CODE:<mirrors>
    <mirror>
        <id>provided</id>
        <url>http://nexus.host/content/groups/provided</url>
        <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>

            actionListener="#{reportGeneratorMB.generateReport} ajax="false"/>
</form>
...
 I've searched by I still haven't found a thing that can help me, and since it is working locally I do not know what can I do. I am not sure if this data is enough, but if it isn't I'll be grateful if you tell me what information I need to provide to get some help. Thanks in advance, Juan G

@LINK:/questions/20705984/how-do-i-run-nginx-as-proxy-to-jetty
@TITLE:How do I run nginx as proxy to jetty?
@CONTENT:I have this setup: I installed nginx and Jetty on an ubuntu machine that I am using as the server. I tested Jetty and it is running on 0.0.0.0.:8080 and I see the Jetty Welcome page. The domain that I will be using is nomilkfor.me. The nginx conf file is in /etc/nginx/sites-available/nomilkfor.me.conf. I am programming on an another laptop (OSX) and I created a project web_test with lein. I created a .war file of web_test and when I run lein ring server I see the content of core.clj on the browser. Initially, I set up nginx conf file after this answer but I could not make it work. I want to ask how I can fix the conf file below (with my questions) and how to deploy web_test with nginx as proxy to jetty. I pasted the conf file below and added my questions for each directive: # what should the ip address and port be?
# i assume this instructs nginx to send request it receives on port 80 to Jetty server
upstream ring {
    server ????? fail_timeout=0;
}

# what directory do I need to enter here?
# do I use the clojure project root?
# do I use ~/web_test/src ?
server {
    root /?????;

    # make site accessible from http://localhost
    server_name nomilkfor.me;

    location / {
        # first attempt to serve request as file
        try_files $uri $uri/ @ring;
    }

    # we will need to understand these settings
    location @ring {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

        # what do I use here???
        # is http://ring; correct???
        proxy_pass http://ring;
    }

    location ~ ^(assets|images|javascript|stylesheets|system)/ {
        expires    max;
        add_header Cache-Control public;
    }
}
 Note: This is my third question about the same subject but I still could not solve. Thanks for all the help. Can I use Clojure with nginx? How to serve clojure pages with nginx?

@CONTENT:I'd like to be able to create some super simple json string with jbuilder since it's included in rails 4 by default. Say I got some Categories current_project.categories. At the moment I'm using this jbuilder construct to get only the category titles: json.array! current_project.categories do |c|
  json.title c.title
end
 This genervtes the following response: [{"title":"Allgemeine Fragen"},{"title":"Dauerkarten"},{"title":"Heimspiele"},{"title":"Online-Ticketing"},{"title":"Rollstuhlfahrer"},{"title":"Ausw?rtsspiele"},{"title":"Busfahrten"},{"title":"Meine Kategorie"},{"title":"Meine neue Kat"}]
 It would be nice if I could keep that json response way more simple, e.g.: ["Allgemeine Fragen", "Dauerkarten", "Heimspiele", "Online-Ticketing", "Rollstuhlfahrer", "Ausw?rtsspiele", "Busfahrten", "Meine Kategorie", "Meine neue Kat"]
 How can I accomplis this using jbuilder? Thanks!

@TITLE:Android RenderScript copy allocation in rs file
@CONTENT:I'm passing an allocation created from Bitmap into rs file, and inside the script I'm trying to copy the allocation to a new one using the rsAllocationCopy2DRange function, but I get force close when I'm trying to run the app. Can someone please explain how to use the function correctly, and what exactly are the arguments it gets. I looked in the reference site: http://developer.android.com/reference/renderscript/rs__allocation_8rsh.html#a7f7e2369b3ed7d7db31729b6db7ba07e but I still don't know what are the dstMip and dstFace and how to get them. Edit: I want to implement sobel operator, and in the implementation I need to use negative values after convolution with kernel, which is not possible using the build in allocation created from Bitmap and build in convove3x3, because the allocation is using uchar4. So I thought to implement convolution inside separate script so I can use the negative before it stored back to allocation. And I want to be able to pass only one allocation and kernel matrix, and inside the script I want to create new output allocation from the input allocation, and make the convolution on it and than copy the result back to the input allocation. I don't want to create the output allocation outside the script, in the java code, I want the entire process to be as transparent as possible, without the need to add objects that are unknown to the user.

@LINK:/questions/20704923/reusing-asp-net-code-in-multiple-pages
@TITLE:Reusing ASP.NET code in multiple pages
@CONTENT:Is there a way to reuse a piece of ASP.NET code (that tag-based code, not the code-behind) in many different pages? For example I have a <div> with some contents in it that appears in 5 different pages of my site. I'm looking for a technique through which I could save this <div> in a separate web-content file so to speak, with maybe a different extension like MyDiv.ASPC and could then do a server-side tag anywhere in a webpage like: <asp:Import href="~/MyDiv.aspc" />
 and ASP.NET would inject the entire content of this file at that point where this tag appears. I thought of creating a user control for this, but I'm not sure if a user control always injects precisely what is written in its body, or could there sometimes be unwanted tags generated by user control itself. Or are there existing better ways of doing this? Edit About Master Pages, they are far away from what I'm looking for. They are actually good for a common basic layout of your website. My idea is quite opposite of that. My pages do not have a common layout; it is just that they have one common <div>. It is more closely fulfilled by a UserControl. For UCs, my fear is that they generate more than what is written in their body, whereas what I'm after is a simple text injection. To put it technically, what I'm looking for is basically a preprocessor step (kind of #include thing in C++) rather than a compiler step, if you see what I mean.

@TITLE:ListView in widget does not update
@CONTENT:I want to update a ListView in a widget from a service. For this I have this code in my service: Intent intent = new Intent(ctx, ListProvider.class);
intent.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, widgetId);
intent.setData(Uri.parse(intent.toUri(Intent.URI_INTENT_SCHEME)));

remoteViews.setRemoteAdapter(widgetId, R.id.listViewWidget, intent);
appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(widgetId, remoteViews);
 I'm sure that the service is running and the code is executed but in the widget on the homescreen nothing happens. My ListProvider looks like this: public class ListProvider implements RemoteViewsFactory
{
    public ListProvider(Context context, Intent intent) 
    {
        Log.d("ME",  "new ListProvider");

        this.context = context;
        appWidgetId = intent.getIntExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID);

        populateListItem();
    }

    private void populateListItem() 
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
        {
            ListItem listItem = new ListItem();
            listItem.heading = "Heading" + i;
            listItem.content = i + " This is the content";
            listItemList.add(listItem);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() 
    {
        return listItemList.size();
    }

    @Override
    public long getItemId(int position) 
    {
        return position;
    }

    @Override
    public RemoteViews getViewAt(int position) 
    {
        final RemoteViews remoteView = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(), R.layout.list_row);
        ListItem listItem = listItemList.get(position);

        remoteView.setTextViewText(R.id.heading, listItem.heading);
        remoteView.setTextViewText(R.id.content, listItem.content);

        return remoteView;
    }

    @Override
    public RemoteViews getLoadingView() 
    {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public int getViewTypeCount() 
    {
        return 1;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasStableIds() 
    {
        return true;
    }

    // Some other override methods

    public class ListItem 
    {
        public String heading,content;
    }
}
 And this is my AppWidgetProvider: public class MyWidgetProvider extends AppWidgetProvider
{
    @Override
    public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int[] appWidgetIds) 
    {
        super.onUpdate(context, appWidgetManager, appWidgetIds);
    }
}
 But the ListProvider is never called I think. The Log message is not displayed and on the homescreen nothing happens. Any ideas why?
@CODE:Intent intent = new Intent(ctx, ListProvider.class);
intent.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, widgetId);
intent.setData(Uri.parse(intent.toUri(Intent.URI_INTENT_SCHEME)));

remoteViews.setRemoteAdapter(widgetId, R.id.listViewWidget, intent);
appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(widgetId, remoteViews); public class ListProvider implements RemoteViewsFactory
{
    public ListProvider(Context context, Intent intent) 
    {
        Log.d("ME",  "new ListProvider");

        this.context = context;
        appWidgetId = intent.getIntExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID);

        populateListItem();
    }

    private void populateListItem() 
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
        {
            ListItem listItem = new ListItem();
            listItem.heading = "Heading" + i;
            listItem.content = i + " This is the content";
            listItemList.add(listItem);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() 
    {
        return listItemList.size();
    }

    @Override
    public long getItemId(int position) 
    {
        return position;
    }

    @Override
    public RemoteViews getViewAt(int position) 
    {
        final RemoteViews remoteView = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(), R.layout.list_row);
        ListItem listItem = listItemList.get(position);

        remoteView.setTextViewText(R.id.heading, listItem.heading);
        remoteView.setTextViewText(R.id.content, listItem.content);

        return remoteView;
    }

    @Override
    public RemoteViews getLoadingView() 
    {
        return null;

@TITLE:Responsive sidebar and input
@CONTENT:I have an issue with a responsive menu containing an input. The original thread is here: Fixed Responsive Top Nav / Off Canvas Nav with Single DOM Element If I add an extra li, with an input (for a search field), I get a jump if I click the input. This happens only if I have scrolled before opening the sidebar. ul class="left">
      <li class="divider divider-first"></li>
      <li class="active"><a href="#_" class="toggle-nav">Main Item 1</a></li>
      <li class="divider"></li>
      <li><a href="#_" class="toggle-nav">Main Item 2</a></li>
      <li>
        <form method="get" action="/search.html">
          <input type="text" placeholder="Search" name="Search">
        </form>
      </li>
</ul>
 Here's the fiddle with the extra li: http://jsfiddle.net/29qgW/5/ If you open the result window on an iPhone, you can see it happening. Some kind of margin gets added above both the sidebar and the top bar. I tried to find it with the iOS simulator, but the margin is not really there as a style. It gets even worse if you try to scroll after having selected the input. How can this be fixed? I've tried to change the metatag to disallow user zooming, but that doesn't work. Does anyone know how to fix this? Update: edited to show metatag, and closed input tag.
@CODE:ul class="left">
      <li class="divider divider-first"></li>
      <li class="active"><a href="#_" class="toggle-nav">Main Item 1</a></li>
      <li class="divider"></li>
      <li><a href="#_" class="toggle-nav">Main Item 2</a></li>
      <li>
        <form method="get" action="/search.html">

@TITLE:Why do calls to Class Module Private Subs fail when using `Me`? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Why can't the VBA Me keyword access private procedures in its own module? 4 answers When using a Class Module in VBA, how come a call to a Private Sub will fail when using Me in front of it, but a call to a Public Sub is OK? For example, the code below (not a full Class Module, just a snippit) produces the error Method or data member not found or the line Call Me.SetupQuote. However, if I make SetupQuote() a Public Sub all is fine. Surely when a Class Module is calling from within itself it shouldn't matter if the sub is public or private? I realise I can just call a Private Sub without using Me, but I want to understand why VBA behaves in this way. Thanks. Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Me.QuoteID = 15
    Call Me.SetupQuote
End Sub

Private Sub SetupQuote()
    Set Quote = New classQuote
    Call Quote.SetQuote(Me.QuoteID)
End Sub

Searching online I found a few implementations using Android but no complete example for multi-line text using standard Java only so thought it would be worth posting my solution here. The requirements were: Take a String of potentially any size and render it out with properly formatted paragraphs to fit into PNG images, splitting the String into lines and paragraphs properly. If the rendered document does not fit into one page then generate multiple BufferedImages, one for each page.

@TITLE:Android access sharedpreferences from webpage loaded with loadURL
@CONTENT:My Android app mixes a native part (user autentication and secure code retrieval) with an HTML part loaded with loadURL (webpage with javascript Kinetics for some drawing options). Inside one of my javascripts I need to access an external server for data retrieval. This external access needs autentication. I want to use the autentication data stored in my SharedPrefernences during the autentication inside the native part. Is there a way to access shared prefs from inside my javascripts in the HTML part?

@TITLE:A code that used to work works no more for api level lower than 11 - crash doInBackground
@CONTENT:Okay, I have a code that used to work just fine and right now it doesn't work only for devices, lower than 11. Everything starts out fine and in my main activity I launch an AsyncTask, inside doInBackground appears the error as shown below:          @Override
    protected Integer doInBackground(Integer... params) {
        final String info = getString(R.string.inf);
        final String post = getString(R.string.pos);
        final String main = getString(R.string.mai);

        String val1 = "";
        String val2 = "";
        String val3 = "";

        int connSucc = 3;

            try {
                JSONTokener sbTokener = new JSONTokener(Sources.httpGet(infoUrlStr).toString()); //==========>>It crashes right here

                JSONArray jArray=new JSONArray(sbTokener);
                for(int i=0; i<(jArray.length()); i++)
            {
                JSONObject json_obj_inf = jArray.getJSONObject(i);
             .
             .
             .
 So I checked Sources.httpGet: public static StringBuilder httpGet (String urlStr) {
    StringBuilder err = new StringBuilder();
    hata.append("Error!");

    HttpURLConnection conn = null;
    BufferedReader rd = null;
    StringBuilder sb = null;
    try {
        URL url = new URL(urlStr);
        conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setConnectTimeout(6000);
        conn.setReadTimeout(10000);
        if (conn.getResponseCode() >= 200 && conn.getResponseCode() <= 299) {
            rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
            sb = new StringBuilder();
            String line;
            while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {
                sb.append(line);
            }
            rd.close();

            conn.disconnect();

        }
        else {
            return err;
        }
    }
    catch (NetworkOnMainThreadException a) {
        return err;
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        return err;
    }
    finally {
        if (rd != null) {
            try {
                rd.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                return err;
            }
        }
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.disconnect();
        }
    }
    return sb;
}
 I think it can't even get to this httpGet method. As I've said this works just fine for api level higher than 11. Below is my logcat which didn't help me that much. 12-20 10:32:11.194: E/AndroidRuntime(357): FATAL EXCEPTION: AsyncTask #1

@TITLE:MVC app facebook passing object from view to controller at submit
@CONTENT:I'm developing a faceboook app with framework MVC. Today I should pass an object from View to Controller, but after the POST in the controller I can't see the compiled object. Controller's code is like:  [HttpPost]
 [FacebookAuthorize("email", "user_photos")]
 public async Task<ActionResult> SaveReview(FacebookContext context, ExampleModel model)
 {
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    { 
       return View();
    }
    return View("Error");
 }
 And View's code is like: @using AppFBReview.Models
@using Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Facebook.Models
@model ExampleModel
@using (Html.BeginForm("SaveReview", "Home", FormMethod.Post))
{
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.ExampleParameter)
    <input type="submit" value="Send" />
}
 Someone can tell me why? Thanks.

 Is it possible to specify string in Select as this is not sure what I will get in each case, I need different data all the time. Is it possible to do so?

Like it picks data from database till to the servlet but when it has to display at that specified date then no error nothing but display's with empty boxes at specific location.

 What I am trying to do is to join the department table "dept" with the "course" table and the "course" table with the "files" table. So when outputting it shows a table with department with course and files all together. The solution doesn't work. It only creates a join between the "course" table and the "files" table.

@TITLE:No error in REPL, it causes only when I run the app the normal way
@CONTENT:I have an app in Scala which uses some library written in Java. In Build.scala: lazy val defaultSettings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ buildSettings ++ Seq(
    scalacOptions ++= Seq("-encoding", "UTF-8", "-optimise", "-deprecation", "-unchecked"),
    javacOptions  ++= Seq("-Xlint:unchecked", "-Xlint:deprecation"),
    parallelExecution in Test := false,
    compileOrder := CompileOrder.JavaThenScala   // Java then Scala
  )
 Here is a simplified version of what I have. When I run the code below in REPL (sbt "project my-project" "console" - I have a few modules in my project that's why I use "project my-project") and print "public class JavaClass1 extends javax.xml.ws.Service...." then "val res1 = new JavaClass1() .... res1.getResult()" it works well, there is no error. I looked into this more carefully and it turned that the error occurs only when I run an application as a normal application - "sbt" "project my-project" "run" : // my app in Scala
object Main extends App {
  val res1 = new JavaClass1() // error
  res1.getResult()
}

// a class in a different library  written in Java
public class JavaClass1 extends javax.xml.ws.Service
{
    private final static URL WSDL_LOCATION;
    private final static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(JavaClass1.class.getName());

    static {
        URL url = null;
        try {
            URL baseUrl;
            baseUrl = JavaClass1.class.getResource(".");
            url = new URL(baseUrl, "blabla.wsdl");
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            logger.warning("Failed");
            logger.warning(e.getMessage());
        }
        WSDL_LOCATION = url;
    }

    public JavaClass1() {
        super(WSDL_LOCATION, new QName("someDefaultURI", "someName")); // here is the error caused
    }
  //........
}

@TITLE:Layout Management with wxPython
@CONTENT:This new question is build on this I am having problem with managing the layout in wxPython. In this program I have two buttons in two layouts. But no matter what I do I cant change the position or alignment of those buttons. Those buttons got fixed in blue and yellow layout. My code goes like this: import wx
class myframe(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, size=(1000,700))

        self.TitlePanel = wx.Panel(self, size=(350, 400))
        self.TitlePanel.SetBackgroundColour("green")

        self.newPanel = wx.Panel(self, size=(300, 250))
        self.newPanel.SetBackgroundColour("black")
        self.newPanel.Hide()

        self.imgPanel = wx.Panel(self, size=(300, 250))
        self.imgPanel.SetBackgroundColour("red")

        self.modulePanel=wx.Panel(self, size=(350, 250))
        self.modulePanel.SetBackgroundColour("blue")

        self.TCPanel=wx.Panel(self, size=(300, 250))
        self.TCPanel.SetBackgroundColour("yellow")

        self.myGridSizer = wx.GridBagSizer(1,1)
        self.myGridSizer.SetEmptyCellSize((0, 0))
        self.myGridSizer.Add(self.TitlePanel, pos=(0, 0), span=(4,8), flag=wx.EXPAND)
        self.myGridSizer.Add(self.imgPanel, pos=(0, 10), span=(4,8), flag=wx.EXPAND)
        self.myGridSizer.Add(self.modulePanel, pos=(10, 0), span=(4,8), flag=wx.EXPAND)
        self.myGridSizer.Add(self.TCPanel, pos=(10, 10), span=(4,8), flag=wx.EXPAND)
    ############################# Add Text to 1st Panel #########################################
        self.text1 = wx.StaticText(self.TitlePanel, label="This is a test run",style=wx.ALIGN_LEFT,size=(300,-1))
        font = wx.Font(18, wx.DECORATIVE, wx.ITALIC,wx.BOLD, wx.NORMAL)
        self.text1.SetFont(font)
        self.titleSizer = wx.BoxSizer()
        self.titleSizer.Add(self.text1, flag=wx.CENTER|wx.LEFT|wx.ALIGN_RIGHT,border=10)
        self.TitlePanel.SetSizer(self.titleSizer)
    #########################################################################################
    ############################### Add Buttons in 3rd Panel ################################
        self.moduleSizer = wx.BoxSizer()
        self.button1 = wx.Button(self.modulePanel, label="Show Yellow Panel",size=(200,-1),style=wx.ALIGN_RIGHT)    
        self.moduleSizer.Add(self.button1, flag=wx.CENTER|wx.EXPAND|wx.ALIGN_RIGHT,border=10)
    #########################################################################################
        self.TCSizer=wx.BoxSizer()
        self.button2 = wx.Button(self.TCPanel, label="Bring Black Panel",size=(200,-1)) 
        self.TCSizer.Add(self.button2, flag=wx.CENTER|wx.RIGHT|wx.ALIGN_RIGHT,border=10)
    #########################################################################################
        self.SetSizer(self.myGridSizer)

        self.text1.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_DCLICK, self.hideMe)
        self.button1.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.showMe)
        self.button2.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.hideMe)

    def hideMe(self, event):
        self.TCPanel.Hide()
        self.myGridSizer.Replace(self.TCPanel, self.newPanel)
        self.newPanel.Show()
        self.Layout()

    def showMe(self, event):
        self.newPanel.Hide()
        self.myGridSizer.Replace(self.newPanel, self.TCPanel)
        self.TCPanel.Show()
        self.Layout()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = wx.App()
    region = myframe()
    region.Show()
    app.MainLoop()
 Right now if I can take the buttons to slightly right side of the layouts that would be good. And is there any good tutorial for this. Please suggest. What I wish to do: Button from blue panel should be at the middle of blue panel Button from yellow panel will have a indent of my desired pixels. If I wish to leave a gap of 20 pixel then button will be placed after 20 pixels in yellow panel. If this is possible then it would be a big help.

        self.TitlePanel.SetBackgroundColour("green")

        self.newPanel = wx.Panel(self, size=(300, 250))
        self.newPanel.SetBackgroundColour("black")
        self.newPanel.Hide()

        self.imgPanel = wx.Panel(self, size=(300, 250))

}
 The image uploading works fine, every image gets uploaded, the problem is the image manipulation: No errors are displayed, however the images aren't being being resized to 800x800 px or 100x100 EDIT:: The images are getting copied into the thumbnail folder, they just had the _thumb rename. However, the thumbnail images are being re-sized to "something" by 800px, EX: 1289px by 800px they should be 100px by 100px, the original image is still not being re-sized EDIT:: If I remove the re-size configs: //Resize Configs
        $config_r['source_image']  = '----path----' . $tmp['file_name'];
        $config_r['maintain_ratio'] = TRUE;
        $config_r['width']  = 800;
        $config_r['height']    = 800;
        $config_r['quality']   = 100;
        //end of configs

            $this->load->library('image_lib', $config_r);

@LINK:/questions/20696137/i-o-redirection-differences-between-zsh-and-bash
@TITLE:I/O redirection differences between zsh and bash
@CONTENT:I use zsh at the command-line but the shell scripts I write run bash so that they are portable. I was learning about IO redirection from here when I realized this difference: Note that the command is just an arbitrary one whose first line of output is over stderr and the second line comes over stdout. zsh on OS X: % ls -ld /tmp /tnt 1>&2 2>&1  | sed -e 's/^/++/'
ls: /tnt: No such file or directory
++ls: /tnt: No such file or directory
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Oct 19  2012 /tmp -> private/tmp
++lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Oct 19  2012 /tmp -> private/tmp
 bash: bash-3.2$ ls -ld /tmp /tnt 1>&2 2>&1  | sed -e 's/^/++/'
ls: /tnt: No such file or directory
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Oct 19  2012 /tmp -> private/tmp
 I'm having a hard time figuring out zsh's output. Also, on a Linux the output order's slightly different for zsh: % ls -ld /tmp /tnt 1>&2 2>&1  | sed -e 's/^/++/'
ls: cannot access /tnt: No such file or directory
drwxrwxrwt. 13 root root 4096 Dec 19 23:11 /tmp
++ls: cannot access /tnt: No such file or directory
++drwxrwxrwt. 13 root root 4096 Dec 19 23:11 /tmp
 bash output is identical though. More experimentation in zsh: % ls -ld /tmp /tnt 1>&2 | sed -e 's/^/++/'
ls: /tnt: No such file or directory
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Oct 19  2012 /tmp -> private/tmp
++lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Oct 19  2012 /tmp -> private/tmp

% ls -ld /tmp /tnt 2>&1 | sed -e 's/^/++/'
++ls: /tnt: No such file or directory
++lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Oct 19  2012 /tmp -> private/tmp
 That last one there produces identical results to bash. I figure I should prefer learning bash's behavior inside-out before delving into how zsh ticks, but this isn't really ideal because chances are at least half of the IO redirection I expect to be doing will be spur-of-the-moment hacks that I surely will want to try from the zsh prompt. And I'm actually pretty invested in zsh because I have a ton of custom plugins and it would be a major effort at this point to do a big switch back to bash.

@TITLE:MySQL comparing and excluding results properly
@CONTENT:MySQLFiddle here: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/15d447/25 I have a single table I am trying to work with: Table 1: user_answers table (stores users answers to various questions) The notable values that are stored are the users id (column uid), the question id for the question they are answering (column quid), the answer to the question (column answer) and the importance of their answer (column importance). The end result I want: I'd like to be able to grab all the questions that any two users have answered, excluding any answers from questions that have either not been answered by the other party, answers that are identical between the two, or answers to the same question which have a value of 1 for either user in importance. Again, this will only ever be used to compare two users at a time. Thus far I have been able to get the results, and answers for the two users with all of my conditions except excluding answers they have both answered the same. In the sqlfiddle example you will see both users answered quid 2 with the answer 'aa'. The desired result would exclude quid 2 and only return quid 1. The query I am currently using is this: select ua.quid,
GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,answer,'') SEPARATOR '') as a1, GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=20008,answer,'') SEPARATOR '') as a2
from user_answers ua
where importance <> 1 and uid in (1, 20008)
group by ua.quid
having sum(uid = 1) > 0 and
       sum(uid = 20008) > 0;
 With this query I attempted to add WHERE a1 <> a2 on the same line as the group_concat as well as AND a1 <> a2 after the initial WHERE but was unable to get that to work. Any suggestions?
@CODE:uid quid answer importance select ua.quid,
GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=1,answer,'') SEPARATOR '') as a1, GROUP_CONCAT(IF(uid=20008,answer,'') SEPARATOR '') as a2

@TITLE:regex matching and replacing with the pattern
@CONTENT:I have a following string pattern in Python language for variable name msg: from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_1\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_2\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_3\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
        .
        .
        .
from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_n\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
 What I am looking for matching is the content_1, content_2, content_3, ..., content_n To replace any "\n" inside any content_i with "," For example of some content_i sentence1\n sentence2\n sentence3 expected result as: sentence1, sentence2, sentence3 but I found the problem when I try with msg = re.sub(r"(\]\nmessage:.*?)\n", r"\1,", msg, re.M)
 Some group of pattern, it also replace the \n between content_i and created_time with "," also but I don't want to replace it. My question, I would like to use re module to searching \n in every content_i and replacing with "," only. Note: any content_i can have many of \n inside
@CODE:from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_1\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_2\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_3\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n
        .
        .
        .
from:\t[xxxxxx]\n
message:\tcontent_n\n
created_time:\tyyyyy\n sentence1\n sentence2\n sentence3 sentence1, sentence2, sentence3 msg = re.sub(r"(\]\nmessage:.*?)\n", r"\1,", msg, re.M)

@LINK:/questions/20694384/why-is-facebook-share-button-pulling-parameters-from-the-meta-tags-instead-of-my
@TITLE:Why is Facebook share button pulling parameters from the meta tags instead of my specified ones?
@CONTENT:I used to have share buttons in a dynamically created page that shared specific content from the page: <a class="share" onclick="window.open('http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?s=100&amp;p[title]=TITLE&amp;p[summary]=SUMMARY&amp;p[url]=http://www.facebook.com&amp;&amp;p[images][0]=imageurl', 'newwindow', 'width=555, height=315'); return false;"></a>
 This resulted in a share window with the content that was specified in the parameters inside the above code (TITLE, SUMMARY, IMAGEURL, URL, etc). It seems, however, that recently Facebook deprecated this code and now what's happening is that when you try to share, you see my specified parameters but once you post them on Facebook different content shows up! Instead of seeing my specified parameters, it seems like Facebook crawls the page that's specified in the URL and looks for the information inside the meta tags on that page. This means that all my share buttons on the page are now posting the same meta tag. Anyone know how I can fix this or basically share custom content?
@CODE:<a class="share" onclick="window.open('http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?s=100&amp;p[title]=TITLE&amp;p[summary]=SUMMARY&amp;p[url]=http://www.facebook.com&amp;&amp;p[images][0]=imageurl', 'newwindow', 'width=555, height=315'); return false;"></a>

@TITLE:How to stop exception when type in wrong data type using scanner
@CONTENT:Can someone tell me how to prevent this: "Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException at java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:909) at java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1530) at java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2160) at java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2119) at JeffSky.main(JeffSky.java:25)" when the user inputs a letter for an int. Basically I am trying to find out how to keep the program running even though a wrong data type has been entered. Just like you can do an if statement to notify the user it is not allowed if they input an int outside a given range e.g from 1-10. for(int x=1; x<=3;x++) { int guess;
        System.out.print("Your chosen trap is: "); 

        do{
            guess=sean.nextInt();

            if(guess>=1 && guess<=6){   
                //do nothing if is a valid number i.e a trap between 1 and 6.
            }                                           
            else {
                System.out.print("Has to be between 1-6. Try again: ");
            }
        }

        while(guess<1 || guess>6);

 Will this ever cause an out of memory exception or any other problems since the stream is getting data pushed in but it is not going anywhere? Thanks

@CONTENT:I am trying to deploy a script via our Group Policy that will run in the background and watch for a process called "3dsmax.exe". Each time this process is started, I want to make sure it's priority level is set to "low". My Powershell understanding is extremely limited. I tried combining the following using different forums but that does not seem to work and I beleive this will terminate after first occurrence which is not preferable. I use "calc.exe" as a testing process. #requires -version 2.0

 Any help would be super:)

@LINK:/questions/20692712/php-input-contains-data-for-a-get-request
@TITLE:php://input contains data for a GET request
@CONTENT:I am running Apache2 and PHP 5 on Linux, and I'm getting some strange behavior with the php://input stream. For some GET requests the stream is not empty like it should be. Instead, the php://input stream contains the entire GET request. I have worked around the issue but I would like to know if I should file a bug about this, or if it is "desired but undocumented" behavior. Details Early in the request processing, I call: $in = file_get_contents('php://input');
if ( !empty($in) )
    $post_data = json_decode($in);

if ( !empty($in) && is_null($post_data) ) {
    // output some error info and exit
}
 Usually when a request does not have a body then $in is empty and all is right with the world. But sometimes a GET request will have a body, and that body will be the entire request. Of course you can't json-decode that data, and the error condition gets hit. This only happens with some requests. For example, this request does not exhibit the error: GET /os/invitations/kkkkkk HTTP/1.1
Host: our.machine.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa==
 But this request, which is routed through some proxies and VPNs, does trigger the error. GET http://some.proxy.at.some.big.company.com:7080/cvp-out/cmmproxy/os/invitations/d66065566dba541c8ba6a70329684645 HTTP/1.1

X-Remote-Host: 53.231.244.171
X-Server-Name: some.proxy.at.some.big.company.com
X-Server-Port: 7080
X-Scheme: http
 I spent hours treating this like a routing/dispatch problem, but it turned out to be our code. The fix was, of course, to only read from the input stream when you are expecting data: if ( in_array( $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], array('PUT', 'POST') )) {
    $in = file_get_contents('php://input');
    if ( !empty($in) )
        $post_data = json_decode($in);
}
 Is this a known issue? Does it happen unpredictably? Should I file a bug?

    $post_data = json_decode($in);

 What I would like to do, is setup the table so that for each group of ingredients - 0_booze_id INT(11),
0_gen_booze_id INT(11),
0_gen_soda_id INT(11),
0_soda_id INT(11)
 only one column can be used (three columns must be null) OR all four of a group must be null. Is it even possible to create something like this??? If not, what would be a better solution? EDIT For clarification - I'm making an automated drink mixing robot. I'm trying to create a database that allows the use of generic ingredients in the event that a specific ingredient is not available. For example, if a recipe calls for "Jack" and "Coke", and I have the ingredients "Jack" and "Coke" available, then I would want to use those specific ingredients. However, lets say I have some off brand cola that I wish to use in place of Coke. I want the recipes that call specifically for "Jack" and "Coke" to be able to substitute "Coke" for "generic cola". My intent was to create two generic tables, one for soda and one for booze "gen_soda" "gen_booze". These tables would contain items such as "Cola" "Whiskey" "Vodka". The tables soda and booze would contain specific ingredient names such as "Coke" or "Jack Daniels"; these items would then be referenced back to their generic types. The mixers table that I originally posted about was to contain all the various mixed drinks that the robot would know how to make. The only mixed drinks that should be available are ones that have the specific ingredients available. This is how I came across the term polymorphic associations.

@TITLE:Adding Sum of fields of two tables giving strange result in Crystal Report
@CONTENT:I am using SAP crystal reports for Visual studio. I have two tables (TableA, TableB). with fields PriceA, PriceB. TableA Field : PriceA ={20,40,40}; TableB Field : PriceB ={50.40,60}; I have created a formula in my main report Formula1 = Sum(TableA.PriceA) + Sum(TableB.PriceB) But instead of getting result as @Formula1 =250. It is giving the incorrect result like '1050' (not exact). How can i get a correct result in this case.

@TITLE:Load large bitmap from url and resize it
@CONTENT:I want load huge image from url and show on my device. I read this post for doing this. In that example they use native drawable but I want get image from server. I am using this code  private void getBitmap(ImageView imageView,final String url){

        mBitmapOptions = new BitmapFactory.Options();
        mBitmapOptions.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
        URL mUrl = null;
        InputStream is= null;
        try {
            mUrl = new URL(url);
            is = mUrl.openStream();
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
//        BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is,null,mBitmapOptions);

        mCurrentBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(mBitmapOptions.outWidth,
                mBitmapOptions.outHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
        mBitmapOptions.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
        mBitmapOptions.inBitmap = mCurrentBitmap;
        mBitmapOptions.inSampleSize = 1;
        BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is,null,mBitmapOptions);
        imageView.setImageBitmap(mCurrentBitmap);
//        Bitmap croppedBitmap=Bitmap.createBitmap(Bitmap.createBitmap(mCurrentBitmap, 0, mCurrentBitmap.getHeight()/2, mCurrentBitmap.getWidth(), mCurrentBitmap.getHeight()/2));
//        imageView.setImageBitmap(croppedBitmap);
    }
 I want here get image from url and resize it but I have an exception. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: width and height must be > 0
 What I did wrong here? or could you suggest me better answer?

@TITLE:Nuget Powershell: How to pass project folder to command
@CONTENT:I have some small c# console applications whose path have been added to the system path and at such can be called anywhere. Because of this, I can run these applications from the package manager (PM) console. This thing now is how do I pass a path to one of the projects to the document. E.g. one of the console applications is "document". I want to execute document --path=[path to .Model project] Given that the solution has three(3) projects with one active, how should the command be written so that it is passed in the path to the active or selected project.

@LINK:/questions/20691805/getting-horizontal-stack-bar-example-to-display-using-d3-js
@TITLE:Getting horizontal stack bar example to display using d3.js
@CONTENT:I looked on the Stack Exchange for how to create a horizontal stacked bar example, and found: http://tributary.io/inlet/4966973 Which is based on: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3943967 To better understand how this code works I got Bostock's example running on my machine (via SimpleHTTPServer, etc.). However, I couldn't get gelicia's Tributary example to run. I copied gelicia's Tributary example, and added Bostock's html code (leading up to the script), and additionally the functions below where the Tributary example ends, but the svg body and resulting bar rects aren't created. But there's no obvious error message to fix something. I tried switching the xs and ys in Bostock's function since I read that was the main conversion issue from going from vertical to horizontal stacked bars, but that didn't help and once again no error appeared. Can someone explain to me how to get the horizontal bar stack example to run, and what I've been done wrong in trying to get it to work within an html document? <!DOCTYPE html>

@TITLE:TextViews do not align correctly in RelativeLayout
@CONTENT:I have a textview (uploaderTv) which should be lined up below titleTv with viewCountTv to the right of it. The problem is the titleTv sometimes overlaps into a second line - and causes an overlap with the text below it (look below the word Rihanna - you can barely see the uploaderTv textView).

@TITLE:consolidate the fonts between merges pdfs itextsharp C#
@CONTENT:I need to merge multiple pdfs together. I am using itextsharp to create all the pdfs. I need to reduce the size of the pdfs to the lowest possible size. I know the fonts are being duplicated for each pdf. Is there to use only one set of fonts throughout the merged pdf? For example, pdf1 is 2.8mb and pdf2 is 2.8 mb I merge them together and its about 5.7mb. I know for a fact that both of those pdfs are using the same font but the data for the font is being duclpicated even though its in the same pdf. I tried using setting the compression properties to best compression and set full compression and that barely reduced the size. Though when i ran the pdf through Acrobat X pro and optimize its reduce almost 90%+ from like 160 mb to 5 mb. The usage audit says its 90% of the pdf is fonts before optimizing. Now is there a way to consolidate the fonts between merges pdfs ?

@CONTENT:EDIT heres what i have to do... Imagine if i have a text with some html tags inside it (it is still a string): var string = '<p>Hello, my name is Mauricio</p><p>Hi, my name is Patricia</p><p class="warn">Yeah, My name is Carl</p><a href="#"><img src="#" /></a>';
 And i want to wrap all the letters "a" with  <span class="ui-match"></span>
 but i must not replace anything from the tag, neither what is inside it, neither the class in the element. So if I want to wrap all the letters "a" from that string, it would return like that: <p>Hello, my n<span class="ui-match">a</span>me is M<span class="ui-match">a</span>uricio</p><p>Hi, my n<span class="ui-match">a</span>me is P<span class="ui-match">a</span>trici<span class="ui-match">a</span></p><p class="warn">Ye<span class="ui-match">a</span>h, My n<span class="ui-match">a</span>me is C<span class="ui-match">a</span>rl</p><a href="#"><img src="#" /></a>
 all the letters "a" where wrapped with  <span class="ui-match"></span>
 , but the link and the paragraph were not. also this string is comming from a API, so its dynamic... this letter i'm searching is dynamic, so it can be "a" or "abc"... it must not be case sensitive thanks
@CODE:var string = '<p>Hello, my name is Mauricio</p><p>Hi, my name is Patricia</p><p class="warn">Yeah, My name is Carl</p><a href="#"><img src="#" /></a>'; <span class="ui-match"></span> <p>Hello, my n<span class="ui-match">a</span>me is M<span class="ui-match">a</span>uricio</p><p>Hi, my n<span class="ui-match">a</span>me is P<span class="ui-match">a</span>trici<span class="ui-match">a</span></p><p class="warn">Ye<span class="ui-match">a</span>h, My n<span class="ui-match">a</span>me is C<span class="ui-match">a</span>rl</p><a href="#"><img src="#" /></a> <span class="ui-match"></span>

@TITLE:Cannot access a Java static method from Scala
@CONTENT:I'm having an issue with Scala and Java interoperability which Google and SO seem to be unhelpful (I've seen similar questions, but none offered a working solution for my case). I have created a jar file in Java (hosted here, if you need it to answer this question) which contains a class with a static method. However, I can't seem to access this static method from Scala. Here's the code: val graph1 = ...
val graph2 = ...
val union = DirectedGraph.merge(graph1, graph2)
 The method exists, and I can access it with normal Java code. In fact, the following works: DirectedGraph<OWLClass> graph1 = ...;
DirectedGraph<OWLClass> graph2 = ...;
DirectedGraph<OWLClass> union = DirectedGraph.merge(graph1, graph2);
 I've checked that the jar files being used by java and scala are the same. And I also checked to see if the method was indeed there with javap. Is there an idea out there to understand and possibly solve this problem?
@CODE:val graph1 = ...
val graph2 = ...
val union = DirectedGraph.merge(graph1, graph2) DirectedGraph<OWLClass> graph1 = ...;
DirectedGraph<OWLClass> graph2 = ...;
DirectedGraph<OWLClass> union = DirectedGraph.merge(graph1, graph2); javap error while loading DirectedGraph, class file 'fetchers.jar(pt/remoteowl/objects/DirectedGraph.class)' is broken (class scala.MatchError/class DirectedGraph (of class scala.reflect.internal.Symbols$ClassSymbol)) value merge is not a member of object pt.remoteowl.objects.DirectedGraph

@TITLE:Is there a more efficient way to convert periodicity of an intraday OHLC DataFrame in python
@CONTENT:In Python, using the pandas library I would like to convert my minutely data into daily data. After loading in the data (from a csv) and making a DatetimeIndex as the index the object xx looks like the following: <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
DatetimeIndex: 540949 entries, 2007-01-02 09:46:00+08:00 to 2013-10-17 16:15:00+08:00 
Data columns (total 5 columns):
Open      540949  non-null values
High      540949  non-null values
Low       540949  non-null values
Close     540949  non-null values
Volume    540949  non-null values
dtypes: int64(5)
 I would now like to convert this intra-day data into daily OHLC data. My initial attempts looks like the below: xx['date'] = [i.date() for i in xx.index]
xx['dailyOpen'] = xx.groupby('date').Open.transform(lambda s: s[0])
xx['dailyHigh'] = xx.groupby('date').High.transform(lambda s: s.max())
xx['dailyLow'] = xx.groupby('date').Low.transform(lambda s: s.min())
xx['dailyClose'] = xx.groupby('date').Close.transform(lambda s: s[len(s)-1])
dd  = xx.groupby('date').tail(1)[['dailyOpen','dailyHigh','dailyLow','dailyClose']]
dd.head()
 Is there a more efficient/eloquent way of doing this? NOTE I just found this method...which is neater...but is there a way perhaps using resample and if using this method could I convert a minutely OHLC timeseries into a 15 minute timeseries OHLC? (N.B. there can be some missing minutes so splitting by every 15 rows wont work...) def ohlcsum(df):
    df = df.sort()
    return {
       'Open': df['Open'][0],
       'High': df['High'].max(),
       'Low': df['Low'].min(),
       'Close': df['Close'][-1],
       'Volume': df['Volume'].sum()
      }

xx.groupby('date').agg(ohlcsum)
 Also would rather than making a date column by writing something like this xx['date'] = [i.date() for i in xx.index]
 Would it be possible to use the TimeGrouper('1D') function to be able to group by date? I tried using the following but for some reason it doesn't seem to work... xx.groupby(TimeGrouper('1D')).agg(ohlcsum)
 Any help would be much appreciated...
@CODE:DatetimeIndex xx <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

@TITLE:How do I use TextChanged event in VBA visio?
@CONTENT:This is related to this question How do I programmatically/automatically change the text formatting for the text of a Visio shape after I am done with the editing? There I tried to use some code that would be executed when the text of a shape is edited For some reasons, as described there, in some situations which I could not isolate the code is executed endlessly. That is probably because the script calls itself in a loop. The code is supposed to be executed every time the text of the shape is edited BUT the code itself changes the color of the text. I guess that would count as a new text change and so on. I am thinking about using the event called TextChanged. According with the documentation this should execute the code when the user finished the editing http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff768749.aspx I could not find a example of using such event in VBA and here is where I need your help thanks in advance Uni This is how I tested: I used CallThis('ThisDocument.warning") to call the procedure below from "TheText" event of that shape (available via the shapesheet) Sub warning(oShape As Visio.Shape) MsgBox ("Text edited") End Sub This gets executed like three times if I star editing the text of a shape and I press the space key (adding a space to the existing text)

@TITLE:How to find users who like a certain comment in Livefyre
@CONTENT:Using Livefyre's JavaScript API, I'd like to get a list of all the people who like a certain comment. To further illustrate, Livefyre provides commenting, similar to Disquus and other plugins. Users who are logged in can "like" a comment. I'd like to find all the users who like a particular comment. Livefyre seems to only return the first four as user avatars before displaying just a total number. I can't find in the documentation how to request the users who like a comment, only the total comment like count. Any suggestions?

@LINK:/questions/20687547/nsmanagedobjectcontext-not-saving-properly-to-sqlite
@TITLE:NSManagedObjectContext Not saving properly to SQLite
@CONTENT:SO, I have a problem with Core Data and trying to save data out to a SQLite database correctly. I have two "Apps": one for loading the SQLite data (Lets call that "Loader.App"), and one for displaying the data ("Display.App"). The loader is just a convenience "bridge" between a web-based CMS which exports data as JSON data and the App which needs an SQLite DB (which is, again, loaded by Core Data). When I save the context in Loader.App, it saves the data into the SQLite file. I can open this file in a SQLite reader (like Base.App) and it shows all the data. The problem is: when I bring that SQLite file to Display.App, it copies the file into the documents directory but it doesn't have any data inside of it. It does, however, have all of the proper tables - just like the SQLite file before I load the data. The odd thing is that if I open the SQLite DB file in a reader (Base.App) and VACUUM the database, it loads in Display.App perfectly fine. From experience with file io in Python I know that if you don't close the file properly, the data isn't written to the file from the io buffer. Clearly, the data is being written to the SQLite file (thus I can open it with a reader (Base.App)). But it makes me wonder if there a file closing method that I am not calling? Basically... Method 1: Run Loader.App Copy MyAppDB.sqlite to Display.App Run Display.App Result: MyAppDB.sqlite has no data inside of it Method 2: Run Loader.App Open MyAppDB.sqlite with reader (Base.App) VACUUM Copy MyAppDB.sqlite to Display.App Run Display.App Result: MyAppDB.sqlite contains data and we have much joy. Here is a trimmed down version of my Loader.App:     int main(int argc, const char * argv[])

@TITLE:How to write reusable controllers code for dojox.mobile views
@CONTENT:I'm writing an application based on dojox.mobile framework. I'm using dojo 1.9. Some views of the application are really similar and have a lot of things in common so I would like to create a general view and extend it to specialize it. Given that every view has a controller, I tried to create a parent controller (which is a module defined via the define function) and then tried to extend it, but without success. What I am doing is creating a GeneralController.js like the following: define(["dojo/_base/declare",
        "dojo/_base/lang",
        "dojo/on"], 
    function(declare,lang, on){
        return declare("AppControllers/GeneralController",[],{
            init: function(){
                     //do something in GeneralController
            },

            beforeActivate: function(){
                     //...
            }
        })
    }
);
 and a View1.js controller like the following: define(["dojo/_base/declare",
        "dojo/_base/lang",
        "dojo/on",
        "AppControllers/GeneralController"], 
    function(declare,lang, on, general){
        return declare(general,{
            init: function(){
                     //do something in this View1.js controller
                     this.inherited();//do what was in general
            },

            beforeActivate: function(){
                     //...
            }
        })
    }
);
 and in the config.json I have: {
    //...
    "views":{
        //...
        "View1":{
           "template":"AppTemplates/View1.html",
           "controller":"AppControllers/View1.js"
        },
        //...
    }
    //...
}
 The dojo.mobile framework seems not accept view controllers written as dojo class (via declare). How can I obtain a hierarchy of view controllers?
@CODE:define(["dojo/_base/declare",
        "dojo/_base/lang",
        "dojo/on"],

                     //do something in GeneralController
            },

            beforeActivate: function(){
                     //...
            }
        })
    }
); define(["dojo/_base/declare",
        "dojo/_base/lang",
        "dojo/on",
        "AppControllers/GeneralController"], 
    function(declare,lang, on, general){
        return declare(general,{
            init: function(){
                     //do something in this View1.js controller

@TITLE:Apigee: can't upload binary data for asset
@CONTENT:I understand that this is a beta feature, but I am getting nowhere with it. I can create the asset, but when I try to upload the data, I don't get anything useful. This is what I'm doing (javascript): this.uploadImageData = function(asset, imageData) {
var options = {
method : 'POST',
endpoint : 'assets/' + asset.uuid + '/data',
data : imageData // <-- read in from a file using FileReader.readAsBinaryString()
}

console.log('preparing to upload image data');
console.log(options);
var self = this;
this.client.request(options, function(error, response) {
self.uploadingImageData(error, response);
});
}
 This is the response I get: Error (500)(web_application): undefined apigee.js:2975
Object {error: "web_application", timestamp: 1387435347814, duration: 0, exception: "javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException"} apigee.js:2975
 I could really use someone's help in figuring out what is going on.

@LINK:/questions/20686608/jersey-resource-not-found
@TITLE:Jersey resource not found
@CONTENT:Trying Jersey for the first time, I've quickly run into a problem that I can't figure out. I have two resources in the same package, following the same blueprint, but at runtime, Jersey only finds one of them. I have checked that both classes exist in the same folder in the jar included in the war. Update: If I remove the @Path annotation on DashboardResource (effectively removing the resource), then DetailsResource suddenly comes to life. It seems like details is hidden by dashboard in some way. In desperate need of some ideas of how to resolve this! Facts and code Versions: Jersey 2.4.1, Apache Tomcat 7.0.47 This one works fine: package jerseytest;

import javax.ws.rs.*;

@Path("/dashboard")
public class DashboardResource {
  @GET
  @Produces("text/plain")
  public String getDashboard() { return "Dashboard"; }
}
 This one gives me an HTTP 404: package jerseytest;

import javax.ws.rs.*;

@Path("/details")
public class DetailsResource {
  @GET
  @Produces("text/plain")
  public String getDetails() { return "Details"; }
}

@TITLE:Ruby on Rails: Ran rake assets:precompile and now both local and heroku deployment don't include bootstrap
@CONTENT:I was having issues deploying my project to a heroku server (Precompile fail). So I found this response, http://stackoverflow.com/a/13713753/2989437, and followed up on the advice. I added one line to my application.rb file: application.rb module FirstEdc
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false # I added this line
  ...
 end
end
 I then ran the precompile command, committed the changes, and managed to deploy successfully to heroku. However, now my bootstrap/css appears to have stopped functioning both on the heroku deployment, and my local deployment. I learned that I was supposed to add another line to my deployment.rb file: deployment.rb FirstEdc::Application.configure do
  ...

  # Allows for local precompilling --added by Ian
  config.assets.prefix = '/dev-assets'

 So I added this, recompiled and redeployed, but to no avail. Finally, I ran a rake assets:clean in an attempt to at least get my local deployment back to normal, but it did not work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm reading more into the asset pipeline now, but I feel like this could be a cache problem or something. I'll update as I figure out what's going on. edit. Just to clarify, I've tried removing both additions, running a rake assets:clean and rake assets:clean:all, but neither fix my local deployment.

  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false # I added this line

end FirstEdc::Application.configure do
  ...

  # Allows for local precompilling --added by Ian
  config.assets.prefix = '/dev-assets'

@CONTENT:Here is the story : I had a huge mvc2 website using entity framework 4.0 and few days ago, I decided to upgrade mvc2 => mvc4 and EF4 => EF6 and Framework 4.5 I did that on a project containing about 150 controllers and more than 300 entities. Now the project is running, but not as fast as I thought it will be. I'm using Entity Framework 6.0.2 with EF 5.x DBContext Generator T4. I used the DB Context generator because with EF4 I did DataBase First. In the past I used this command line to pre-compiled my views.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to run a shell script (say myscript.sh) from a java program. when i run the script from terminal, like this : ./myscript.sh
 it works fine. But when i call it from the java program, with the following code : try
    {
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("/bin/bash","./myScript.sh",someParam);

        pb.environment().put("PATH", "OtherPath");

        Process p = pb.start();

        int exitVal = p.waitFor();
    }catch(Exception e)
    {  e.printStackTrace();  }
}
 It doesnt goes the same way. Several shell commands (like sed, awk and similar commands) get skipped and donot give any output at all. Question : Is there some way to launch this script in a new terminal using java. PS : i've found that "gnome-terminal" command launches a new terminal in shell, But, i'm unable to figure out, how to use the same in a java code. i'm quite new to using shell scripting. Please help Thanks in advance

@TITLE:Strip or overwrite an AngularJS $resource
@CONTENT:I need to copy data from one resource to another. Problem is that the $get, $save etc methods on the old resource remain when wrapping an old resource in a new resource. Example: http://plnkr.co/edit/d2oHwm?p=preview var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngResource'])

myApp.controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $resource) {

    var ResourceA = $resource('A');

    var ResourceB = $resource('B');

    var instances = {};
    instances.A = new ResourceA({

    instances.B = new ResourceB(instances.A); // <-- trouble

    instances.B.$get(function() {
        $scope.instances.B = arguments[0]
    });

    $scope.instances = instances;
});
 I don't want to keep a separate object with the clean data of ResourceA because the object can be modified in multiple places. I also rather don't want to write a foreach loop to fetch the pure data. Can I get a copy of the pure data in a ResourceA without the magic methods? Or is there some other way to ignore/strip/overwrite the magic methods in a resource? Background info: A user can create/modify a template (resourceA). The user can use that template to create a new object (ResourceB). When that happens, the object needs to inherit all properties from the template, except for the $resource methods.
@CODE:$get $save var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngResource'])

myApp.controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $resource) {

    var ResourceA = $resource('A');

@LINK:/questions/20682634/how-to-wait-for-thread-notification-instead-of-joining-all-the-threads
@TITLE:How to wait for Thread notification instead of joining all the Threads?
@CONTENT:In few words, a user makes a request to my web service, and I have to forward the request to X different APIs. I should do it on parallel, so I'm creating threads for this, and the first Thread that answers with a valid response, I should kill the rest of the threads and give back the answer to my customer right away. One common pattern in Ruby, is to create multiple threads like threads << Thread.new {}
threads.each { |t| t.join }
 The logic I already have is something like: results = []
threads = []
valid_answer = nil

1.upto(10) do |i|
  threads = Thread.new do
    sleep(rand(60))
    results << i
  end
end

threads.each { |t| t.join }

valid_answer = results.detect { |r| r > 7 }
 But on a code like the previous, I'm blocking the process until all of the threads finish. It could be that one thread will answer back in 1 second with a valid answer (so at this point I should kill all the other threads and give back that answer), but instead, I'm joining all the threads and doesn't make too much sense. Is there a way in ruby to sleep or wait until one thread answer, check if that answer is valid, and then blocking/sleeping again until all of the threads are done or either until one of them gives me back a valid response? Edit: It should be done in parallel. When I get a request from the customer, I can forward the request to 5 different companies. Each company can have a timeout up to 60 seconds (insane but real, healthcare business). As soon as one of these companies answer, I have to check the response (if its a real response or an error), if its a real response, I should kill all of the other threads and answer the customer right away (no reason to make him to wait for 60 seconds if one of the requests gives me back a timeout). Also, no reason to make it on a loop (like if I do this on a loop, it would be like 5 x 60 seconds in the worst scenario).
@CODE:threads << Thread.new {}
threads.each { |t| t.join } results = []
threads = []
valid_answer = nil

1.upto(10) do |i|
  threads = Thread.new do
    sleep(rand(60))
    results << i
  end
end

threads.each { |t| t.join }

valid_answer = results.detect { |r| r > 7 }

 I tried json_decode($response) but it returned NULL so i assumed that this is already the correct JSON format. I tried echo $response->id and it returns blank I've also tried multiple variations of foreach ($response->id as $value) { var_dump($value); } which also returns nothing Help!

@TITLE:Unable to click a button even though I am able to retrieve it using the Name
@CONTENT:var navigator = BonusAppControllers.EbsControl.CurrentApp.GetWindow("XWindow").Get(SearchCriteria.ByAutomationId("AnimatedExplorerNavigator"));
  AutomationElement dashboardElement = navigator.AutomationElement.FindFirst(TreeScope.Subtree,SearchConditionFactory.CreateForName("NavigateLink_1").AutomationCondition);

 I have this code for the button with Name as NavigateLink_1. Now when i run this and debug it, I find that I am able to get the correct button instance in the dashBoardBtn variable but the Click() function isn't working. Even if i try to do all this just by using the button name as in using Get(SearchCriteria.ByText("NavigateLink_1")) I face the same problem. The same thing I tried with some other button part of the same group of buttons but it's working fine in that case. Can Anyone suggest me what could be the problem.I am using the White Framework and UI Spy as the UI inspector for my application
@CODE:var navigator = BonusAppControllers.EbsControl.CurrentApp.GetWindow("XWindow").Get(SearchCriteria.ByAutomationId("AnimatedExplorerNavigator"));

In the New Relic trace we see lots of Application code (in System.Web.Mvc.MvcHandler.BeginProcessRequest()) - Our agent can't see what is happening in your .NET code.

Now the problem is - my client wants to keep all these media content private to my application. It can not be read by gallery and user can not even see them from sdcard directly. Those media files should be visible in our application only. The first solution is to store all files in internal storage. But this is not advisable as videos and images will fill up the internal storage and user wont be able to download more apps without internal memory.

@CONTENT:I am very confused by the felix-bundle plugin. The documentation says of the Import-Package tag This header rarely has to be explicitly specified. However, in certain cases when there is an unwanted import, such an import can be removed by using a negation package pattern But I am building a plugin and it seems to be importing lots of things that I don't want. javax.servlet is going in, as are junit.* and org.junit.*, and org.testng, and some apache logging packages. All of these are making my package crash in use with a missing requirement error. The thing is, I have no idea why these are getting included in the first place. Very confused. Help welcome. In response to an answer, AFAIK, I am not using javax.servlet anywhere in my code. My POM currently looks like this. I've had to exclude lots of packages which are otherwise breaking the load.

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: What specifically are the dangers of eval(parse(¡K))? 4 answers I've been told that it is a bad habit to parse and evaluate a character string to_run = "for (i in 1:10){print(i);print('Hello World!')}"

eval(parse(text=to_run))
 Why is it a bad habit? It seems to me to be quite a flexible way of programming as we can construct our code in a iterative manner by pasting character strings together. For example it allows to easily deal with objects of various dimensions for example. if (length(dim(my.array)) == 2){to_run = "A = my.array[1,]"}
if (length(dim(my.array)) == 3){to_run = "A = my.array[1,,]"}
eval(parse(text=to_run))
@CODE:to_run = "for (i in 1:10){print(i);print('Hello World!')}"

eval(parse(text=to_run)) if (length(dim(my.array)) == 2){to_run = "A = my.array[1,]"}
if (length(dim(my.array)) == 3){to_run = "A = my.array[1,,]"}

@LINK:/questions/20677604/thread-isinterrupted-always-returns-false
@TITLE:Thread.isInterrupted always returns false
@CONTENT:Maybe, it is a duplicate question of Thread.isInterrupted doesn't work, Thread.interrupted does. But since I use a quite different way to call Thread.isInterrupted() and have upgraded to a newer jdk, I just think this may be caused another kind of problem. There are three threads (not including the main thread) in my program. a sleep thread sleeps for 10 seconds; a checker thread checks if the sleep is interrupted by another thread; an interrupter interrupts the sleep thread as long as it's started. And here is my program: package foobar;

public class Foobar {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Thread sleep = new Thread(new Sleep());
        sleep.start();

        Thread checker = new Thread(new InterruptedChecker(sleep));
        checker.start();

        Thread interrupter = new Thread(new Interrupter(sleep));
        interrupter.start();
    }
}

class InterruptedChecker implements Runnable {

    private final Thread thread;

    InterruptedChecker(Thread thread) {
        this.thread = thread;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            if (thread.isInterrupted()) {
                break;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The thread is interrupted.");
    }
}

class Sleep implements Runnable {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

class Interrupter implements Runnable {

    private final Thread thread;

    Interrupter(Thread thread) {
        this.thread = thread;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("interrupting...");
        thread.interrupt();
    }
}
 The interesting thing is that somethings (quite a lot) the program keeps running and doesn't print the message "The thread is interrupted." which means that the sleep.isInterrupted() returns false, but somethings it does. Here is the java -version of my pc (Ubuntu 13.10 64bit): java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
 After I read Thread.isInterrupted doesn't work, Thread.interrupted does above, I tried to compile my code in a different machine using an older jdk and it worked. And, here is the java -version of the machine (Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update 3) 64bit): java version "1.6.0_06"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_06-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 10.0-b22, mixed mode)
 So my question is that: Is there something wrong in my program? If it doesn't, does the multicore cpu or the 64 bit system have something to do with this problem? EDIT Thanks for Peter's comment. What problem are you trying to solve? I just read the post as I have stated in my comment, where in the Chapter of "Don't swallow interrupts" it says that, code higher up on the call stack can learn of the interruption and respond to it if it wants to. So I'm not sure if the checker thread in my program acts as, what it is called here, code higher up. I just have a try to prove the post is right. But it seems that there is something wrong.

@TITLE:Worklight WAS Liberty profile configuration based on Tomcat configuration
@CONTENT:For a Pilot project we've set up a Worklight server on a WAS using the Liberty profile. We're basing it on the configuration LDAP configuration of a Tomcat server (used for RTC) on the same machine, but they don't seem to map propertly to each other (in the sense that we can't just "copy-paste" the configuration. We've come to the point where logging into the LDAP server (An Active Directory server) works, but the login doesn't work and doesn't return any error message apart from a failed login in the logs. I am rather sure the binding to the LDAP server succeeds, since when changing the password in the configuration to any other value to the correct one, the log shows a problem regarding it. Is it possible to take a look at these configurations and see what could be wrong? The configurations are the following: For the Tomcat server: <Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm"

@TITLE:Needing assistance with counting the most different books
@CONTENT:Which customer(s) ordered the most different books? Display the customer id and include ties. This is not talking about the quantity of books ordered. For example, suppose my only orders are Customer 1 ordered 400 copies of book_id 34 Customer 2 ordered 2 copies of book_id 62 and 3 copies of book_id 29 Customer 1 ordered a larger quantity of books but customer 2 ordered more different books. The query should - in this case- return customer 2: Here is my attempted solution. Not sure how to solve this one: SELECT cust_id
  FROM a_bkorders.customers
 WHERE cust_id IN 
       (
       SELECT cust_id
         FROM a_bkorders.order_headers
         Join a_bkorders.order_details using (order_id)  
        GROUP BY cust_id
        HAVING count(book_id) <=  
         (
          SELECT MAX(numBooks) 
                  FROM (  
                    SELECT cust_id
                        ,  count(book_id) AS numBooks
                      Join a_bkorders.order_details using (order_id)  
                      FROM a_bkorders.order_headers 
                     GROUP BY cust_id
                      ) t

@LINK:/questions/20676849/replace-an-existing-layout-with-new-layout-with-wxpython
@TITLE:Replace an Existing layout with new layout with wxPython
@CONTENT:I am new to wxPython. I am making a layout with Gridbagsizer. I almost succeeded in making my desired layout. But for some unknown problem it is giving some problem. My objective: I made 5 layouts. Green, Red, Blue, Yellow and Black. When I double-click on "This is test run", the yellow layout is supposed to be replaced by black layout completely. What actually happens: Yellow gets replaced by black. No problem on that. But blue layouts position gets shifted to bottom for some reason. My code goes like this: import wx

class myframe(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        "Constructor. No arguments"
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, size=(1000,700))
        self.TitlePanel = wx.Panel( self, size=(350, 400) )
        self.newPanel = wx.Panel( self, size=(300, 250) )
        imgPanel = wx.Panel( self, size=(300, 250) )
        modulePanel=wx.Panel( self, size=(350, 250) )
        self.TCPanel=wx.Panel( self, size=(300, 250) )

        self.newPanel.SetBackgroundColour("black")
        self.newPanel.Hide()
        ############################################        
        self.myGridSizer = wx.GridBagSizer(1,1)
        self.myGridSizer.Add(self.TitlePanel, pos=(0, 0), span=(4,8), flag=wx.EXPAND)

        self.myGridSizer.Add(self.TCPanel, pos=(10, 10), span=(4,8), flag=wx.ALL)
        #############################################
        self.text1 = wx.StaticText(self.TitlePanel, label="This is a test run",style=2,size=(350,-1))
        font = wx.Font(18, wx.DECORATIVE, wx.ITALIC,wx.BOLD, wx.NORMAL)
        self.text1.SetFont(font)

        print "show!"

        self.Layout()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = wx.App()

@CONTENT:I am currently trying to make a chronometer in c# using the timespan class. So far I have been able to appropriately start, pause, and stop the chronometer, but I have been asked to make a lap button that registers the time in the chronometer upon click, and make another button that opens another form to list said lap times. It is this part that i have trouble with. Basically I need help with registering the time and retaining those values to later show them in a list. I appreciate your time and willingness to help. This is some of the code i tried to make for registering the time along with making a different class called LapList, it didnt go very well. private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{            
    TimeSpan Et = Crono.Elapsed;
    TimeSpan LapTime = Et - LastBreakTime;
    LastBreakTime = Et;
    ++Lapcount;
    LapList.getTimeSpan().Add(LapTime);
}
 Thanks again for your time.

 SnapShot: I am able to retrieve the images from a seperate folder from my SD card and display it in a grid view but the view seems rather collapsed. Does it has something to do with screen size ? I am using a Galaxy ACE DUOS (3.5 inch). Will try to post the screen shot shortly. Help will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

    // insert 200,000 more <video> entries here
 No idea why this is all written as CDATA but there's not much I can do about it, it's the data I've been given. My code to read this massive (1.5gb) XML file is to stream it using fs to sax then to saxpath, like so: var saxpath = require('saxpath')
var fs = require('fs')
var sax = require('sax')
var parseString = require('xml2js').parseString;
var util = require('util');

var saxParser = sax.createStream(true)
var streamer = new saxpath.SaXPath(saxParser, '/videos/video')

streamer.on('match', function(xml) {
    console.log(xml);
    parseString(xml, function (err, result) {
        var json1 = JSON.stringify(result);
        var json = JSON.parse(json1);
        console.log(util.inspect(json, false, null));
    });

});

fs.createReadStream('./xml/big_data_file.xml').pipe(saxParser)
 However, when I get to the console.log(xml), it shows this: <video>
    <id>620339</id>
    <thumbs>
        <thumb></thumb>
    </thumbs>

 No data inside whatsoever. There's no mention of CDATA in the Saxpath Docs, although I'm not sure if this is an issue with Saxpath or Sax itself. Any ideas how I can remedy this? Cheers!

@CONTENT:I have looked at the aggregate data questions on this forum and elsewhere - but I don't quite see an answer that helps me but that may be non-understanding on my behalf.I apologize. I have a huge amount of raw data test findings and I want to aggregate certain scores into one mean score. I can do this by creating a new variable in compute > transform but I cannot do this for 330+ by adding it 1 + 2 + 3 all by hand. My question is: How can I aggregate hundreds of scores and calculate a new mean score as a new variable in a quick and intelligent fashion that so far eludes me? For example, I have 339 latency measures for 50 participants. I want to calculate ONE overall latency score as a new variable. Thanks! I am desperate for direction.

@CONTENT:I have a Raspberry Pi connected to my Macbook Pro by two radio modules. I have been successful so far in sending strings and commands from one device to the other using pyserial, however, I cannot find a way to send a text file. Like on HyperTerminal, where you can choose to send a text file over xmodem. I have downloaded the xmodem library and played with it a bit, and I think I am able to send files, but I have no idea how to receive them on the other end. Any help?

@TITLE:Universal iOS app - UIButton and UITableView sizes
@CONTENT:I'm developing my first universal iOS app with XCode 5.0.2 and iOS 7, and I have some questions on the screen size differences between iPhone and iPad (including Mini). If the app contains UIButtons with custom .png images, do I need to increase the size of the UIButtons along with bigger size images when developing for iPad?. I'm already half done with the iPhone app and not using storyboards but using IB to create NIBs. I tried to use the same iPhone UIButton size on the iPad NIB and it looks small. Is this the right approach of having bigger size UIButtons along with custom sized png image files for these two different devices? The same questions go with UITableViews. Do I need to have bigger ones on the iPad?. The iPhone ones look smaller on the iPad. Also, note that I added a new iPad specific NIB but copied the same UITableView control from the iPhone specific NIB to the iPad NIB. I also read this article on AppCoda, custom button sizes are used when I opened the sample project with XCode 5. Another article from Ray Wenderlich's site (although 3 years old) talks about autosizing. Which is the best approach or is there anything that I need to know?

 Since the id value is being created by MySQL, I would like to set/create/maintain the id field in ruby so that puts dog.id will not be an empty string. Was wondering if this piece of code would accomplish that: def new_from_hash(hash)

@TITLE:How to add a ¡§webwork1¡¨ action linked to a ¡§project admin tab¡¨ in Jira?
@CONTENT:I created a web-item and a webwork action. My web-item displays a new tab in the administration section of projects. The link of the tab points to my actions. The only problem is that my webwork action is displayed completely in another page.

@TITLE:Commenting Regular expressions in python
@CONTENT:This answer to a question regarding the maintainability of regular expressions mentions the ability of .NET users to implement comments in their regular expressions (I am particularly interested in the second example) Is there an easy native way to reproduce this in python, preferably without having to install a third party library or writing my own comment-strip algorithm? what I currently do is similar to the first example in that answer, I concatenate the regular expression in multiple lines and comment each line, like in the following example:     regexString  =  '(?:' # Non-capturing group matching the beginning of a comment
    regexString +=      '/\*\*'
    regexString +=  ')'
@CODE:regexString  =  '(?:' # Non-capturing group matching the beginning of a comment

@CONTENT:I need help print and save element in an array in javascript. I know that I have to create an array, and then use a for-loop to save and print it, but i don't know how.

@TITLE:jQuery to parse data and get the lat and lng and insert into Google Maps`
@CONTENT:I am using jQuery to get JSON from the following URL: http://api.chartbeat.com/live/geo/v3/?apikey=fakekeytoshowtheurl&host=example.com
 Here is an example of the JSON I get: "lat_lngs": [[25, -80, 9], [26, -80, 6], [27, -80, 1], [29, -98, 2], [29, -95, 7], [30, -97, 3], [33, -117, 6], [33, -112, 25], [33, -111, 33], [34, -112, 1], [34, -111, 1], [36, -109, 1], [38, -97, 2], [40, -73, 1], [42, -78, 2]]
 I am trying to use jQuery and get each of the lat_lngs and run a function. Here is the code I currently have that is not working. function addMarker(latitude, longitude) {
    marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: new google.maps.LatLng(latitude, longitude),
        map: map
    });
}

$.get('http://api.chartbeat.com/live/geo/v3/?apikey=fakekeytoshowtheurl&host=example.com', function(data) {
    $.each(data['lat_lngs'], function() {
        var latlng = data['lat_lngs'].split(',');
        addMarker(latlng[0], latlng[1]);
    })
});
 This is not working, I get an error saying Object [object array] has no method 'split', and no matter what I have tried, I can't get anything to work. I just want to grab the first two numbers from every lat_lngs that is listed, and run the function addMarker(lat, long). Anyone have ideas?

@LINK:/questions/20666023/xml-attribute-not-getting-namespace-prefix
@TITLE:XML attribute not getting namespace prefix
@CONTENT:I need to generate the following XML during serialization: (fragment) <IncidentEvent a:EventTypeText="Beginning" xmlns:a="http://foo">
  <EventDate>2013-12-18</EventDate>
  <EventTime>00:15:28</EventTime>
</IncidentEvent>
 The class in question looks like this: public class IncidentEvent
{
    public string EventDate { get; set; }
    public string EventTime { get; set; }

    [XmlAttribute("EventTypeText", Namespace = "http://foo")]
    public string EventTypeText { get; set; }

}
 It appears that the serializer is noticing that the namespace is already declared in an xmlns: at the root and is ignoring my attribute. I also tried the following: [XmlRoot(Namespace = "http://foo")]
public class IncidentEvent
{
    public string EventDate { get; set; }
    public string EventTime { get; set; }

    private XmlSerializerNamespaces _Xmlns;

    [XmlNamespaceDeclarations]
    public XmlSerializerNamespaces Xmlns
    {
        get
        {
            if (_Xmlns == null)
            {
                _Xmlns = new XmlSerializerNamespaces();
                _Xmlns.Add("ett", "http://foo");
            }

            return _Xmlns;
        }

        set
        {
            _Xmlns = value;
        }
    }


    [XmlAttribute("EventTypeText", Namespace = "http://foo")]
    public string EventTypeText { get; set; }

}
 This results in the following XML:   <ett:IncidentEvent EventTypeText="Beginning" xmlns:ett="http://foo">
    <ett:EventDate>2013-12-18</ett:EventDate>
    <ett:EventTime>00:15:28</ett:EventTime>
  </ett:IncidentEvent>
 Which is not what I want. The element shouldn't be prefixed, the attribute should be. What is needed to get the serializer to understand what I want?
@CODE:<IncidentEvent a:EventTypeText="Beginning" xmlns:a="http://foo">
  <EventDate>2013-12-18</EventDate>
  <EventTime>00:15:28</EventTime>
</IncidentEvent> public class IncidentEvent
{
    public string EventDate { get; set; }
    public string EventTime { get; set; }

    [XmlAttribute("EventTypeText", Namespace = "http://foo")]
    public string EventTypeText { get; set; }

} [XmlRoot(Namespace = "http://foo")]
public class IncidentEvent
{
    public string EventDate { get; set; }
    public string EventTime { get; set; }

    private XmlSerializerNamespaces _Xmlns;

    [XmlNamespaceDeclarations]
    public XmlSerializerNamespaces Xmlns
    {
        get
        {
            if (_Xmlns == null)
            {
                _Xmlns = new XmlSerializerNamespaces();
                _Xmlns.Add("ett", "http://foo");
            }

            return _Xmlns;
        }

        set
        {
            _Xmlns = value;
        }
    }


    [XmlAttribute("EventTypeText", Namespace = "http://foo")]
    public string EventTypeText { get; set; }

} <ett:IncidentEvent EventTypeText="Beginning" xmlns:ett="http://foo">

@TITLE:Passing Assigned Value of a Spinner from Fragment to Fragment within Viewpager NullPointerException [Solved]
@CONTENT:Ok, I've make it more simple and updated it based on the answers in my previous post: Adding Assigned Values in Spinner NullPointerException I have a MainAcitivty that uses a ViewPager. I have 2 Fragments in my MainActivity (FragA and FragB) In my FragA I have a spinner. While in FragB, I have a TextView and a Button. Now what am I trying to do is, when I select "Hello" in my spinner, my int a will have a value of 5. And when I click the Button, 5 will display in the TextView. Here's my code: FragA public class FragA extends Fragment {

    Spinner spinner1;
    String s1;

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
            Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fraga, container, false); 

        spinner1 = (Spinner) view.findViewById(R.id.spinner1);  
        ArrayAdapter<CharSequence>  adapter_a = ArrayAdapter.createFromResource(getActivity(), R.array.spinner1,android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item );
        spinner1.setAdapter(adapter_a);

        s1 = spinner1.getSelectedItem().toString();

        return view;
    }

    public int getInt() {

        int a = 0;

        if(s1.equals("Hello")) {
            a = 5;
        }

        return a;    
    }

}
 MainActivity public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {

    ViewPager viewPager = null; 

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        viewPager = (ViewPager)findViewById(R.id.pager);    
        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
        viewPager.setAdapter(new MyAdapter(fragmentManager));
    }

    public class MyAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter {  

            public MyAdapter (FragmentManager fm) {
                super(fm);
            }

            @Override
            public Fragment getItem(int i) {
                Fragment fragment = null;

                if (i == 0)
                {
                    fragment = new FragA();
                }
                if (i == 1)
                {
                    fragment = new FragB();
                }
                return fragment;
            }

            @Override
            public int getCount() {
                return 2;
            }   
        }

    public String get() {

        FragA FragA = new FragA();

        return Integer.toString(FragA.getInt());
    }
}
 FragB public class FragB extends Fragment{

    TextView textView;

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
            Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragb, container, false); 

        textView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.textview);
        Button button = (Button) view.findViewById(R.id.button);
        button.setOnClickListener(Click);

        return view;
    }

    OnClickListener Click = new OnClickListener() { 

        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {

            textView.setText(((MainActivity)getActivity()).get());          
        }
    };

}
 By the way, I have no problem passing the value of a from FragA to FragB when this is my code: public int getInt() {

        int a = 5;

        return a;    
    }
 But, it doesn't involve my spinner and that's not I want to do. Hope someone can give me a solution to my problem. Been stuck on this for sometime. Thanks in advance.

 Here is the positon of my UserControl normally: I have added a button to the UserControl to try and make it go the full size of the MainWindow. WHen I click the fullscreen button I have an event on my page which does the following:     private void VideoPlayer_FullScreenSelected(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {            
        var parentWindowWidth = ((System.Windows.Controls.Panel)(Application.Current.MainWindow.Content)).ActualWidth;
        var parentWindowHeight = ((System.Windows.Controls.Panel)(Application.Current.MainWindow.Content)).ActualHeight;

        Thickness margin = new Thickness(0,0,0,0);
        VideoPlayer.Margin = margin;
        VideoPlayer.Width = parentWindowWidth;
        VideoPlayer.Height = parentWindowHeight;

    }
 When I do this I see the VideoPlayer appearing larger like so: Note how it is the size of my Page but not the MainWindow which I want ot to be. So then I have added an event to my Page which triggers a function in my MainWindow that tries to grab the MediaElement from my Page and make it fullscreen. But I dont know how to grab my UserCOntrol from here and make it the size I need. How can I do this??

@TITLE:COALESCE Extrage results on dates and strings
@CONTENT:First of all, I want to clarify that I have already read this question. The problem described there is quite similar to my problem but related with a bug, which has been already solved. I have been getting strange results after querying a MySQL Server (Ver 14.14 running on Linux) through MySQL WorkBench 5.2.47 C running on Windows. The problem is that selections on COALESCE over a list of date and string fields return BLOBS instead dates. For example SET @dat='20130812';
SELECT COALESCE(dateA, @dat) FROM table1;        
 I know the problem can be fixed by casting COALESCE into DATE type: SELECT CAST(COALESCE(dateA,$dat) AS DATE) FROM table1;
 It can also be solved just casting @dat: SELECT COALESCE(dateA,CAST(@dat AS DATE)) FROM table1;
 It seems to me that it is related to internal type conversion but, why does my first query work when the client is the mysql console client? (just as described on the question linked above). Does the client perform some type of query preprocessing? In that case, shouldn't it be common to all clients? I used to think that SQL servers received raw queries (text) from their clients, now I realise that isn't true at all. What level of preprocessing is performed at client side?
@CODE:SET @dat='20130812';

 awfully the dao and pojo are generated in the same package In hibernate tools it is hardcoded DAOExporter :  setFilePattern("{package-name}/{class-name}Home.java");
POJOExporter : setFilePattern("{package-name}/{class-name}.java");
 I find it is extremly ugly and I would like to have pojo and dao in different package and also no suffixing the Dao by "Home" but just "Dao" Do you know if there is some way to provide a custom Exporter implementation or configure something in the pluging to achieve this ? thanks

@TITLE:jquery sql .NET - trying to create a delete button that can remove ID's from server
@CONTENT:So I have a program that generates ID's within a database using jquery and .NET. I am trying to create a delete button so that when the user gets to this section, all they have to do is select the radial button in which the ID is and click the delete button to remove it, but I am unsure of how to do this. I have read that using some sort of ajax call would work but am unfamiliar with the functionality of it. Here is what I have so far:     function UserSelection(Type_ID) {
        var Type_Value = "";

        if (Type_ID == 1)
            Type_Value = "html";
        else if (Type_ID == 2)
            Type_Value = "doc"
        else if (Type_ID == 3)
            Type_Value = "src"

        $('#userselectionmade').dialog({
            width: 700,
            height: 400,
            title: 'Generate Document',
            buttons: {
                'Edit Document': function () {
                    var documentID = $('#<%= rblUserDocument.ClientID %>').children().children().children().find("input:checked").val(); 
                    window.location = "AddEditDocument.aspx?action=Edit&documentID=" + documentID + "";
                },
                'Delete Document': function (){
                    var documentID = $('#<%= rblUserDocument.ClientID %>').children().children().children().find("input:checked").val();
                    window.location = "AddEditDocument.aspx?action=Edit&documentID=" + documentID + "";

                },
                'Cancel': function () {
                    $(this).dialog("close");
                }
            }
        })

        return false;
    }
 The 'Delete Document' button is the one I am having trouble with. If anyone can point me in the right direction, that would be great.

@TITLE:Automating Login Process Using Seleinum PageObjects
@CONTENT:I'm very much new to Selenium and I started automating the login process. I used PageObjects for this purpose. I have a LoginPage which has a method like this: public MyHomePage login(String username,String password)
{
    username.sendKeys(username);
    password.sendKeys(password);

    signInButton.click();
    return PageFactory.initElements(driver,MyHomePage.class);
}
 This works well with correct username and password. But I dont want to repeat the same code for handling invalid cases. Surely for invalid cases, the object that is returned will be the same LoginPage. I wish I could code my login method that way. Any best practice way to so? Since login is very common , there should be a better approach for my case. Or is it I have to write separate code for invalid case?
@CODE:LoginPage public MyHomePage login(String username,String password)
{
    username.sendKeys(username);
    password.sendKeys(password);

    signInButton.click();
    return PageFactory.initElements(driver,MyHomePage.class);

@TITLE:Neo4j .NET Client - Getting a Path from a Node to its Root
@CONTENT:I'm experimenting with Neo4j for the first time. I've played a bit with the console (Cypher queries) and now I'm trying to use the .NET client to build a DAL for a .NET application. For now, my data model is very simple: I have nodes with a label "Folder". These nodes may have a "HAS_SUB_FOLDER" relationship with other folder nodes. I've successfully done some queries such as MATCH (n:Folder) 
OPTIONAL MATCH n<-[r:HAS_SUB_FOLDER]-parent 
WITH n, count(parent) AS parents 
WHERE parents = 0 
RETURN n;
 to get the parent-less nodes (i.e. "folders in the root directory") which translates to: var myQuery = client.Cypher.Match("(folder:Folder)")
            .OptionalMatch("folder<-[r:HAS_SUB_FOLDER]-parent")
            .With("folder, count(parent) AS parents")
            .Where("parents=0")
            .Return<Folder>("folder");
        var res = myQuery.Results.ToList();
// res is a List<Folder>, Folder is a Model in my MVC architecture containing attributes like an ID and a Name.
 in .NET. Now I'm trying to, for a given folder node, find the path to its root (to create some navigational breadcrumbs). The query I wrote for that is: MATCH (current:Folder {id: "...THE_ID..."})
MATCH p = ((current)<-[:HAS_SUB_FOLDER*1..5000]-())
RETURN p;
 which seems to work. I can't, however, achieve that using the .NET client. I want to get a List with the ancestor folders for a given node. I have tried: var getPathToRoot = client.Cypher.Match("(current:Folder)")
            .Where((Folder current) => current.ID == id)
            .Match("p = ((current) <- [:HAS_SUB_FOLDER*1.." + MAX_DEPTH + "]-())")
            .Return<Folder>("NODES(p)");
var result = myQuery.Results.ToList();
 But I get a: Accessed JArray values with invalid key value: "self". Array position index expected. with the following raw JSON: {
  "columns" : [ "NODES(p)" ],

  } ] ] ]
}
 I can see that the data I want is being retrieved but there seems to be a problem when deserializing it. I've tried some variations on my code, with no success and I believe I have a newbie mistake somewhere while trying to get the nodes from the retrieved path. I'd appreciate if someone could help me with this as I'm just starting using Neo4j (and I'm still "hardwired" to think RDBMS), the documentation is (still) a bit sparse and I'm having issues with debugging (whenever I try to peek into the values of any variable from the Neo4j client library, I get a "Function evaluation disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out. You must continue execution to reenable function evaluation.").

@LINK:/questions/20659571/adding-a-custom-font-to-vs-2010-fontface
@TITLE:adding a custom font to VS 2010 @fontface
@CONTENT:Started a new asp.net website (razor v2) website in VS2010 (just as a test template to add a custom font) Added the font 'Gothic.TTd' as an 'existing item' to the project level. Then in 'site.css' I added @font-face
{
    font-family: "Century Gothic";
    src: url('GOTHIC.TTF'),
}
 Then added this font family to the 'body' of site.css to see what it looks like on the home page: body
{
    background-color: #fff;
    border-top: solid 10px #000;
    color: #333;
    font-size: .85em;
    font-family: "Century Gothic", Segoe UI, Verdana, Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
 What else am I missing, how do i generate the css required.? I am working from the following tutorials : http://markchouanard.com/post/25542393378/using-web-fonts-in-your-asp-net-mvc-application http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/605568/Using-font-face-to-use-custom-fonts-in-web-pages http://weblogs.asp.net/sreejukg/archive/2012/05/23/using-custom-fonts-in-your-web-pages.aspx Can anyone suggest what I can do now? thanks for any replies UPDATE I have added <script type="text/javascript" src="GOTHIC.TTF"></script>
 to the _SiteLayout.cshtml file...any other ideas welcome? Is it necessary to have all the URLS (example in @font-face with embedded font does not work ) I only have the .TTF extesions: GOTHIC.TTF
GOTHICB.TTF
GOTHICBI.TTF
GOTHICI.TTF

                 orderby p1.editor_id descending
                 select p1);   //Its my precompile process

public void editordetail()
{
    DataClassesDataContext db = new DataClassesDataContext();
    var rr = editordetail1(db,Convert.ToInt32(Server.HtmlEncode(Request.Cookies["j_id"].Value)));

} public void editordetail()

    var rr =   from p in db.tbl_desc_indexes
              where p.ed_journal_id == 1 && p.j_id==2 && p.j_id1==3

 ServerIP is the variable to be changed. So the batch file has to give people who use it an option to choose from 4 prefixed IPs.

@TITLE:why are the newline characters in my json file showing up as the character ¡§n¡¨
@CONTENT:I have a android app thats supposed to fetch a json file from the web and pars it. I uploaded the json file onto my website as direct file with the extension .json my app fetches this file, but when I print out its contents, anywhere where there should be a newline character, there is a "n" instead, and naturally the json parser doesnt like this and I get an exception. UPDATE: after looking at my code that parses the input stream I found the problem: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(
                is, "iso-8859-1"), 8);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = null;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line + "n");
        }
 for some reason, in this code, which was working flawlessly for my other app, I am appending "n" instead on "\n"!!! I wonder if I deleted the backslash by accident.

@CONTENT:I am trying to update a variable value permanently in Matlab. I want to make a GUI where there will be a button which would have variable's value (e.g. k = 3), I will add that with 4 and show the value (e.g. 7) in a text box. Now the value (i.e. 7) will be the new value of k. So if again I click on the button it would show the updated value in text box (e.g. k=7, in text box: 7+4 =11). I am new in matlab and tried many ways to solve it. The simplest way was:   function addition_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles)
  k =3;
  k = 4+k;
  set(handles.value,'String', ...   %here value is the name of the text box
  [ k ]);
 but each time I am clicking the button, it is starting from very beginning as assumed. How can I declare the variable so that it will work the way I just mentioned?

On the server, I need to process some data and send back a value for later use.

 THE PROBLEM The value from the hidden field gets wiped out on the return trip. I think it is getting wiped on the OnUnload function call.

@TITLE:ActivityNotFoundException is not triggered to open a downloaded PDF file
@CONTENT:I want to download a PDF from a url and also want to trigger catch phrase if no PDF Viewer is detected. Here's my code:     try {
        startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(materialPdfUrl)));
    } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {
        openDialog(getString(R.string.error),
                getString(R.string.no_pdf_reader));
    }
 Now the problem is that ActivityNotFoundException is never triggered because it always download the PDF even if there is no PDF Viewer around. How do you suggest I do this? EDIT: Here's my old code: Intent pdfIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(materialPdfUrl));
pdfIntent.setType("application/pdf");
pdfIntent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP);
startActivity(pdfIntent);
@CODE:catch try {
        startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(materialPdfUrl)));
    } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) {
        openDialog(getString(R.string.error),
                getString(R.string.no_pdf_reader));
    } Intent pdfIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(materialPdfUrl));
pdfIntent.setType("application/pdf");
pdfIntent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP);
startActivity(pdfIntent); openDialog

@TITLE:Magento transfer html price value to cart
@CONTENT:I was successfully able to change the value of the "price" class on this page using this jQuery script: jQuery("#options_46_2").click(function(){
                var priceOldValue = parseInt(jQuery('.product-options-bottom .price-box .price').text().replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ""));
                if (this.checked) {

                    var priceNewValue = priceOldValue + 50 * selectedWeight;

 Unfortunately I need this user to run on ruby 1.9.3. Changing the default ruby version is not an option because rvm is installed system wide (/usr/local/rvm/bin/rvm) and other users on the system rely on 1.9.2. If I were in an interactive session, it would be as simple as rvm use 1.9.3
 However, it appears I can't use rvm use in a non-interactive session (i.e. in the crontab). (I tried it by sticking that in my bashrc file and telling cron to look at my bashrc file. I ended up forkbombing myself..) How do I get my crontab using a specific version of ruby via rvm?

This works, until when I try to add the code to check if the file path is readable/writeable(which I commented the lines out). It now does not go into the recursive loop.

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void listDir(char *name, FILE *fp)
{
    DIR *dir;
    struct dirent *entry;

    if (!(dir = opendir(name)))
        return;
    if (!(entry = readdir(dir)))

@TITLE:reload javascript in a page once the content in the div is changed
@CONTENT:this is how my app works. I have a navigation bar, once I click a link from the bar, one particular part of the page (div) will change its content (ajax). Most of the contents are graphs and tables and uses css and javascript. The problem is, the effect of the js is not shown/used whenever I click the links. I figured that the js should be reload everytime the content of the div is changed. how do I do that? Here's the script. <script>

@TITLE:Rails CSV upload to update records - attribute not saved to db
@CONTENT:I have a system for updating InventoryItem records using a CSV upload. I have this controller method: def import
        InventoryItem.import(params[:file], params[:store_id])
        redirect_to vendors_dashboard_path, notice: "Inventory Imported."
    end

Which of course calls this model method:

def self.import(file, store_id)
    CSV.foreach(file.path, headers: true) do |row|
    inventory_item = InventoryItem.find_or_initialize_by_code_and_store_id(row[0], store_id)
    inventory_item.update_attributes(:price => row.to_hash.slice(:price))
        end
    end
 I want to update only the :price attribute in the update because and :code and :store_id won't change. Currently the records being imported have price all as 0.0 (big decimal). Not nil, or the correct value, but 0.0, so clearly I'm doing something wrong to make this work. I know when I do this in the console it looks something like this: inventory_item = InventoryItem.find_by_id(1)
inventory_item.update_attributes(:price => 29.99)
 Any ideas on why I'm not updating the price attribute correctly?
@CODE:InventoryItem def import
        InventoryItem.import(params[:file], params[:store_id])

@TITLE:Resetting window after using DirectX 11
@CONTENT:I've written an application that can switch between OpenGL, DirectX 9 and DirectX 11 for rendering without restarting or recreating the window. Switching between OpenGL and DirectX 9 as well as to DirectX 11 mode works well, however, after using DirectX 11 no other rendering mode works any longer. After releasing all DirectX 11 interfaces, the window still shows the last rendered frame, it is even properly updated when resizing the window. A DirectX 9 device can be created and the Present calls succeed, however, all I see is the last frame drawn by DirectX 11. I¡¦ve used IDXGIDebug::ReportLiveObjects to make sure all DirectX 11 interfaces have actually been released. I¡¦ve also tried IDXGIFactory::MakeWindowAssociation, but it didn¡¦t fix the issue. Why is the last frame repainted, who repaints it? How do I get rid of it and restore the original behavior of the window. By the way, creating a new window would be a workaround, but I would like to use the same window for DirectX 9/11 and OpenGL.

        var wypnt = directionsDisplay.getDirections().routes[0].legs[0].via_waypoints.toString().match(/[^()]+/);
        wypnt.toString().split(",");
        wypnt = new google.maps.LatLng(wypnt[1],wypnt[0]);

        var waypoint = [];

        waypoint.push({ location: wypnt, stopover: true });

        route(waypoint);
    });
 Once I pass it back to the route() function (the function that works normally with the To and From fields), I have this section of code: if(waypoint){

    var request = {
        origin: document.getElementById("search-input-from").value,
        destination: document.getElementById("search-input-to").value,
        waypoints: waypoint,
        optimizeWaypoints: true,
        travelMode: google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING
    };
}
else{

    var request = {
        origin: document.getElementById("search-input-from").value,
        destination: document.getElementById("search-input-to").value,
        travelMode: google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING
    };
}
 The rest of the code is based off the following if statement: directionService.route(request, function(result, status) {
    if (status == google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK) {

       //do stuff

     }
    else {
                alert("Directions query failed: " + status);
            }
    };
 Unfortunately all I'm getting back is "Directions query failed: ZERO_RESULTS". Any idea why this is happening? I'm not sure if the way I'm forming the waypoint is wrong or something else.
@CODE:google.maps.event.addListener(directionsDisplay, 'directions_changed', function(){

        var wypnt = directionsDisplay.getDirections().routes[0].legs[0].via_waypoints.toString().match(/[^()]+/);
        wypnt.toString().split(",");
        wypnt = new google.maps.LatLng(wypnt[1],wypnt[0]);

        var waypoint = [];

        waypoint.push({ location: wypnt, stopover: true });

        route(waypoint);
    }); if(waypoint){

    var request = {
        origin: document.getElementById("search-input-from").value,
        destination: document.getElementById("search-input-to").value,
        waypoints: waypoint,
        optimizeWaypoints: true,
        travelMode: google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING
    };
}
else{

    var request = {
        origin: document.getElementById("search-input-from").value,
        destination: document.getElementById("search-input-to").value,
        travelMode: google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING
    };
} directionService.route(request, function(result, status) {
    if (status == google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK) {

       //do stuff

     }
    else {
                alert("Directions query failed: " + status);
            }

 I want exactly that content because using this way, the header, sidebar and footer is removed. I don't want css. I'm not using this because this doesn't work in some browsers. I'd rather not using pdf libraries like tcpdf because Moodle loads the content in a dynamic way and send this to a libraries like that is a mess. I tried using sites like pdfcrowd.com but this kind of sites don't work when the site you want to convert to pdf uses a server-side session to identify the user.

@TITLE:So why isn't this actually starting? ServerSocket and Sockets
@CONTENT:I am trying to build a web server that I can then pass in get,post, put and delete actions to. Something basic and simple. So I decided to write a simple web server that does the following: package aisisplatform.web;

import aisisplatform.web.interfaces.*;
import aisisplatform.web.exceptions.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class WebServer implements WebServerInterface{

    private int bindToPort;
    private Socket socket;
    private ServerSocket serverSocket;

    public WebServer(int port){
        bind(port);
    }

    @Override
    public void bind(int port) throws WebServerException {
        if(port == 0 ){
            throw new WebServerException("Cannot bind to port specified");
        }

        bindToPort = port;
    }

    @Override
    public void start() throws WebServerException {
        try{
           System.out.println("Starting Web Server");
           serverSocket = new ServerSocket(bindToPort);
           socket = serverSocket.accept();
           System.out.println("localhost:" + bindToPort + " is active.");
        }catch(IOException e){
            throw new WebServerException(e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() throws WebServerException {
        try{
            System.out.println("Stopping Web Server");
            serverSocket.close();
            socket.close();
            System.out.println("Web Server Stopped");
        }catch(IOException e){
            throw new WebServerException(e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void restart(){
        System.out.println("Stopping Web Server");
        stop();
        System.out.println("Web Server Stopped");
        System.out.println("Starting Web Server");
        start();
        System.out.println("localhost:" + bindToPort + " is active.");
    }   
}
 Which is then used in: package aisisplatform;

import aisisplatform.web.*;
import aisisplatform.web.exceptions.*;

public class AisisPlatform {

    private static String[] argumentsArray;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if(args.length > 0){
            argumentsArray = args[0].split("=");
            if(argumentsArray[0].equals("--port")){
                WebServer webServer = new WebServer(Integer.parseInt(argumentsArray[1]));
                switch (args[1]) {
                    case "start":
                        webServer.start();
                        break;
                    case "stop":
                        webServer.stop();
                        break;
                    case "restart":
                        webServer.restart();
                        break;
                    default:
                        throw new WebServerException("We only allow --port=xxxxx start | stop | restart ");
                }
            }
        }
    }

}
 You then run the app with the parameters of: --port=xxxxx start | stop | restart the issue is simple. running the app gets to the line: System.out.println("Starting Web Server"); and then it just stops. I have tried debugging it, and playing it through, it sets the port of 47000 but it never finishes starting ... Netbeans is all like "and I set up the server socket and now i am done, allow me to hang here ... " There is no error message thrown nothing.

@TITLE:am I supposed to make images larger for tablets, or same size as handset?
@CONTENT:I am trying to wrap my head around the idea of scaling images which is all new to me. I finally understand for icon launcher you want something like 48x48 for mdpi and 72x72 for hdpi. For this, I have no problem using google's provided tool. I have an image I downloaded from the net that is 178x283 pixels, 96 dpi. When my (4inch 480x800hdpi) phone emulator views this, the image is pretty large, taking about half the screen. On my (10inch1280x800mdpi)phone, it looks smaller, actually the exact same as the original. This is not what I want right? how do I want the images to be scaled? do I want them the same size as the original, or smaller on a small phone and bigger on a big phone. I assume after this step I create the correct qualifiers and do the math done in this thread to resize the images ? Supporting multiple screens on Android. I forgot to mention what does android OS do automatically, because I figured if I have one image in drawable, then it will automatically make the smaller phone have a small image and the bigger phone have a big image, but that is not happening(given that I don't hard code values). EDIT: decided to use this http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/nine-patches.html EDIT2: I have gotten the images and layouts how I want them now, but my 10 inch won't use the correct layout folder. I have this layout
layout-land
layout-sw720dp
layout-sw720dp-land
 it only works when i name them layout-xlarge, which is deprecated, what gives edit:is it because sw qualifier is only for 3.3+ and I am targeting 2.3+?

@LINK:/questions/20644301/copy-specific-text-from-email-message-to-spreadsheet
@TITLE:Copy specific text from email message to spreadsheet
@CONTENT:I get my checking account balance emailed to me once per day. I want to use Google Apps Script to pull the balance from the email message and plug it into my checking account spreadsheet. I am a novice to coding, but so far I have figured out how to do the following, which gets me a log of HTML code of the correct email message: function myFunction() {
 var thread = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName("CHK BAL").getThreads(0,1)[0]; // get first thread in inbox
 var message = thread.getMessages()[0]; // get first message
 Logger.log(message.getBody()); // log contents of the body
}
 However, because this method returns the HTML code for the email message and not the actual message text, it doesn't contain the balance number that shows up in the email itself. I tried substituting getPlainBody in place of getBody, but it returns a null value in the Log. The question posted here is pretty much my same question (Google script that find text in my gmail and adds it to a spreadsheet?), but even with Mogsdad's reply and helpful links I haven't been able to figure out what's going wrong. Can anyone help redirect me on how to get the email content instead of the null value? (Once that's solved, I can't say that the link on Mogsdad's other reply is very clear about how to identify the currency and copy it into the spreadsheet, but of course I haven't been able to play around yet since I can't even access the content yet.) Thanks! EDIT 1 See Serge's answer below for instructions on how to parse the HTML. I used those functions to grab the text of the most recent Bank Account Balance email from a Gmail label/filter and drop it into a cell in my spreadsheet. Then I was able to use the following equation in an adjacent cell to strip it down to just the currency number: LEFT(RIGHT(A5,LEN(A5)-FIND("$",A5)),FIND(CHAR(10),RIGHT(A5,LEN(A5)-FIND("$",A5)))-1)+0 Of course, this works for me because the currency number is always preceded by $ (the first, and in my case, only $ to appear in the text) and always followed by CHAR(10). Anyone trying to apply this formula would need similar consistency before and after the value they are seeking to isolate.
@CODE:function myFunction() {
 var thread = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName("CHK BAL").getThreads(0,1)[0]; // get first thread in inbox
 var message = thread.getMessages()[0]; // get first message
 Logger.log(message.getBody()); // log contents of the body

@TITLE:how to use an extend SearchView in fragment
@CONTENT:I want to extend the SearchView class to override the onKeyDown() method. So i do it within my fragment class as below : public class myfragment extends ListFragment{
...
class CustomSearchView extends SearchView{
    public CustomSearchView(Context context) {
        super(context);
    }       

    public CustomSearchView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event){
        Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "onkeydown", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
    }
}
...
}
 Now i want to make use of this extended SearchView in the fragment. But i am not sure how to do that. Since i create the SearchView object using searchItem.getActionView(), is there some way i can cast it to a CustomSearchView object so that the overriden onKeyDown method gets triggered in my fragment? @Override
    public void onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu, MenuInflater inflater) {
    ...

            // Retrieves the system search manager service
            final SearchManager searchManager =
                    (SearchManager) getActivity().getSystemService(Context.SEARCH_SERVICE);

            // Retrieves the SearchView from the search menu item
            final SearchView searchView = (SearchView) searchItem.getActionView();

            // Assign searchable info to SearchView
            searchView.setSearchableInfo(
                    searchManager.getSearchableInfo(getActivity().getComponentName()));

            searchView.setOnQueryTextListener(new SearchView.OnQueryTextListener() {
                @Override
                public boolean onQueryTextSubmit(String queryText) {
                    // Nothing needs to happen when the user submits the search string
                    return true;
                }

                @Override
                public boolean onQueryTextChange(String newText) {
                    ...
                }
            });

    public CustomSearchView(Context context) {
        super(context);

@TITLE:How can a Bash function detect whether it is being used with positional or named arguments?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Bash function that is to be capable of attempting to use either positional or named arguments, whereby positional arguments are accessed in the usual "${1}", "${2}" way and named arguments are accessed using getopts. I have some example code and example usage shown below in order to illustrate what I'm trying to do. The problem is that the check I'm doing on the variable ${*} is just a grep for the character -, which limits greatly the character content of further arguments. What would be a more intelligent or robust way of checking for named arguments in Bash? example code: function1(){
    # flags
        argumentsFlag1=""
            # n: named arguments
            # p: positional arguments
        verboseFlag1="0"
            # v: verbose
        silentFlag1="0"
            # 0: standard output
            # 1: no standard output
    # options and arguments
        # Determine if positional or named arguments are used.
            # If the arguments contain "-", then named arguments are assumed,
            # otherwise positional arguments are assumed.
                if [ "$(echo "${*}" | grep "-")" ]; then
                    argumentsFlag1="n"
                else
                   argumentsFlag1="p"
                fi
        # handle named arguments
            if [ "${argumentsFlag1}" == "n" ]; then
                OPTIND=1; while getopts "i:sv" options; do
                    case "${options}" in
                        i)
                            input1="${OPTARG}"
                            ;;
                        v)
                            verboseFlag1=1
                            ;;
                        s)
                            silentFlag1=0
                            ;;
                        \?)
                            echo "invalid option -"${OPTARG}""
                            return
                            ;;
                        :)
                            echo "option -"${OPTARG}" requires an argument"
                            return
                            ;;
                    esac
                done
        # handle positional arguments

                input1="${1}"
        fi
    # default values
        if [ -z "${verboseFlag1}" ]; then
            verboseFlag1=0
        fi
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    if  [ "${argumentsFlag1}" == "n" ]; then
        echo "named arguments assumed"
    elif [ "${argumentsFlag1}" == "p" ]; then
        echo "positional arguments assumed"
    fi
    echo "input: "${input1}""
}
 example usage: $ function1 zappo
positional arguments assumed
input: zappo

$ function1 -i zappo
named arguments assumed
input: zappo
 EDIT: Please note that I am not trying to use positional and named arguments at the same time. I am trying to get the function to have a state in which it is interpreting the arguments solely as positional or solely for interpretation by getopts as a mix of positional and named arguments. There are to be instances in which getopts is not used. Imagine the following idea... I have a function that is used from one data type to another. This function has two modes: quick mode This mode can be used in a manner such as the following: function fileName1 fileName2
 It converts one file to another using internal assumptions and measurements made autonomously. advanced mode This mode can be used in a manner such as the following: function -i fileName1 -o fileName2 -m -r 100 -v
 There can be positional arguments used in this mode, but they must be placed after the getopts positional options and arguments.
@CODE:"${1}" "${2}" getopts ${*} - function1(){
    # flags
        argumentsFlag1=""
            # n: named arguments
            # p: positional arguments
        verboseFlag1="0"
            # v: verbose
        silentFlag1="0"
            # 0: standard output
            # 1: no standard output
    # options and arguments
        # Determine if positional or named arguments are used.
            # If the arguments contain "-", then named arguments are assumed,
            # otherwise positional arguments are assumed.
                if [ "$(echo "${*}" | grep "-")" ]; then
                    argumentsFlag1="n"

@TITLE:Issues after updated to Xcode 5
@CONTENT:I had my iOS App up to 98% completed on Xcode 4.6 and iOS 6.1 and it's working OK. But then problems begin when I try to update my Xcode to version 5 and the SDK to iOS 7. When I try to run the app on Xcode 5 but with iOS 6.1 it continues working ok, but when I tried to run on SDK 7 I have these issues: 2013-12-17 19:44:47.656 myAPP[2207:70b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[<MKUserLocation 0x9d9af90> valueForUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key distanceAnnotation.'

@TITLE:Combining ng-grid and ui-select2: unable to select a value
@CONTENT:In the editableCellTemplate of an ng-grid, I wanted to use a more user-friendly dropdown, and I found ui-select2 to be a good one. The thing is however, that any click on this component, when it is used inside the ng-grid, results in the cell juming back to non-editable mode. This way I can't select another value using the mouse (I can using the arrows on my keyboard). When I put the dropdown in the cellTemplate, it works, but it should also work in the *editable*CellTemplate. Some code to see what I mean can be found here. http://plnkr.co/edit/taPmlwLxZrF10jwwb1FX?p=preview Does anyone know why that happens, and what could be done to work around it?

@TITLE:Resteasy (or not Jersey - JAXRS implementation) on WebLogic12c, is possible?
@CONTENT:I have a web application with a restful web service APIs. The application is now developed and works perfectly on Glassfish Server (3.1.x). As implementation of jax-rs the webapp use Rest-easy, because present features that are no present at Jersey. Now, it is necessary to deploy the Web application in WebLogic 12c, specifically in weblogic 12.1.2. But it seemed impossible to do so. Weblogic uses Jersey for restful services and gives conflict if it is to use a different implementation jax-rs. Then the question... is it possible to use an implementation of JAX-RS Jersey different. (in my case RestEasy). Eventhough, the web.xml archive is configured for using the RestEasy Servlet, still show errors like if is used Jersey (<BEA-101216> <Servlet: "Jersey" failed to preload on startup in Web application: "pruebaRestWL-1.0-SNAPSHOT") and ( <Error> com.sun.jersey.spi.inject.Errors>).

@TITLE:Dynamic Sorting using custom table tags DataTables jQuery
@CONTENT:Using the excellent dataTables jQuery plugin, I'm having trouble creating a dynamic array for the "aaSorting" parameter. As per the docs, the "aaSorting" parameter takes an array (or array of arrays) containing the column and the sort order. I need to create a dynamic array for the tables I'm working on, and use the values of the custom table attributes of sortCol and sortOrder which I've added for the tables aaSorting param. I thought I could do this... var sortCol = $('#mytable').attr('sortCol');
var sortOrder = $('#mytable').attr('sortOrder');
var sortData = [];
if(sortCol != '' && sortOrder != ''){
     sortData[sortCol] = sortOrder;
}
 Then in my dataTable initialization, use the sortData var as the value for the "aaSorting" parameter. However, this does not work. Can anyone provide any insight as to how the array must be constructed in order for dataTables to use it for sorting. var myTableObject = dataTable({
     "oLanguage": "Search",
     "aaSorting": sortData
});
@CODE:var sortCol = $('#mytable').attr('sortCol');
var sortOrder = $('#mytable').attr('sortOrder');
var sortData = [];
if(sortCol != '' && sortOrder != ''){
     sortData[sortCol] = sortOrder;
} var myTableObject = dataTable({
     "oLanguage": "Search",
     "aaSorting": sortData
});

@TITLE:How do I get a Cookie from a SoapUI response using a Groovy test step?
@CONTENT:How do I get a Cookie from a SoapUI response using a Groovy test step? I tried this Groovy code, but it's returning zero cookies (or null). This code is part of a test step that runs immediately after a standard REST request returns a result with the following header: Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=45C5E845A0C117E22D26DB04A64E5FD8; Path=/tcompany; HttpOnly
 And the Groovy script I am using that fails to retrieve the Cookie is this: import com.eviware.soapui.impl.wsdl.support.http.HttpClientSupport
def myCookieStore = HttpClientSupport.getHttpClient().getCookieStore()
def myCookies = myCookieStore.getCookies()
def sessionCookie
//log.info("Test:" + myCookies.get(0).getValue() )
if ( myCookies.size() > 0 ) {
  myCookies.each {
    log.info( "Cookie: " + it.name )
    if( it.name == "JSESSIONID" ) {
    sessionCookie = it
    log.info("Found JSESSIONID cookie: " + it.value )
    }
  }
} else {
  log.info("No cookies found in cookie store.")
}
//assert myCookies[0].value().contains("JSESSIONID")
return sessionCookie
 I found a HACK around the problem but this seems like its not the normal way to do it: def val = testRunner.testCase.testSteps['REST Test Request 1'].testRequest.response.getResponseHeaders()
log.info("---- all headers -------")
val.each() { hdrs ->
    log.info hdrs
}
log.info("---- cookie jar contents -------")
def cjar = val.get("Set-Cookie")[0]
log.info ( "Cookie Jar: " + cjar )
def cookies = cjar.tokenize("\\;")
log.info("---- cookies -------")
cookies.each() { cookie ->
    log.info "Cookie: " + cookie
}
log.info("---- separated -------")
cookies.each() { cookie ->
    def pair = cookie.tokenize("\\=")
    log.info( "[- Key: " + pair[0] + ", Val: " + pair[1] + "-]" )
}
log.info("---- end -------")

@TITLE:Restore Fragment default values onswipe
@CONTENT:there are to many threads talking about this but i tried everything and doens't seem to work. My Problem is kinda simple i have a viewpager with 5 fragments pages. Each of this fragment has the same layout only 1 edit text, and the issue is if i write something on the editext onswipe to next or the previous page i would like to reset that edittext. For example: PAGE1: editext=2929 ---(swipe)--- PAGE2: edittext = 0 ----(swipe)--- PAGE1:edittext = 0 But it always shows the 2929. I to do this for my app, im trying to this on teste program. this is my Adpater public class MyFragmentPagerAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter {

int PAGE_COUNT;
int total;
Fragment frag;
FragmentManager fmm;

/** Constructor of the class */
public MyFragmentPagerAdapter(FragmentManager fm, int x, int total) {
    super(fm);
    fmm = fm;
    total = 0;
    PAGE_COUNT = x;
}

/** This method will be invoked when a page is requested to create */
@Override
public Fragment getItem(int arg0) {
    final FragmentTab11 myFragment = new FragmentTab11();
    Bundle data = new Bundle();
    data.putInt("current_page", arg0 + 1);
    myFragment.setArguments(data);

    return myFragment;

}

/** Returns the number of pages */
@Override
public int getCount() {
    return PAGE_COUNT;
}

@Override
public int getItemPosition(Object object) {
    return POSITION_NONE;
}
 this my fragment public class FragmentTab11 extends SherlockFragment {
int mCurrentPage;
TextView tv;
EditText edt;
Button btn;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    /** Getting the arguments to the Bundle object */
    Bundle data = getArguments();
    /** Getting integer data of the key current_page from the bundle */
    mCurrentPage = (data != null) ? data.getInt("current_page", 0) : 1;

}

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    View v = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_one1, container, false);
    tv = (TextView) v.findViewById(R.id.textView1);
    tv.setText("You are viewing the page #" + mCurrentPage
            + " of Frag1\n\n" + "Swipe Horizontally left / right");
    btn = (Button) v.findViewById(R.id.button1);
    btn.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            update();
        }
    });

    edt = (EditText) v.findViewById(R.id.editText1);

    return v;
}

public void update() {
    Log.w("text", mCurrentPage+": " + edt.getText().toString());
    edt.setText("");
}

@Override
public void onDetach() {

    edt.post(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            edt.setText("");
            Log.w("DETACH", "CurrentPage " + mCurrentPage);
        }
    });
    super.onDetach();

}
 And what i like to do its the same of the button listener, reset the edittext but instead of clicking it, it would be on swipe gesture. Thank you, Gon?alo Moura EDIT: xml from fragment_one1 <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

 I tried remove the fragment from FragmentManger,     @Override
public int getItemPosition(Object object) {
    return POSITION_NONE;
}
 also, tv.setOffscreenPageLimit(limit);, tried FragmentStatePagerAdapter and FragmentPagerAdapter, i have state because it destroys the fragment, using events onDetach(), onDestroy() etc etc, if you saw the code of the fragment you can see my method onDetach(), notifydatasetchanged, setting new adapter.
@CODE:public class MyFragmentPagerAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter {

int PAGE_COUNT;
int total;
Fragment frag;
FragmentManager fmm;

/** Constructor of the class */
public MyFragmentPagerAdapter(FragmentManager fm, int x, int total) {
    super(fm);

Searching online didn't seem to help either... Am I missing a namespace or something? Thanks in advance Namespaces: using System;  
using System.Collections;

using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages;  
using System.ServiceModel;  
using System.ServiceModel.Description;

 The function: private void changeUserStatus(Guid userId, IOrganizationService service, int state)  
{  
    SetStateRequest setStateRequest = new SetStateRequest  
    {  
        EntityMoniker = new EntityReference("systemuser", userId),  
        State = new OptionSetValue(state),  
        Status = new OptionSetValue(-1),  
    };  
    service.Execute(setStateRequest);  
}  
 IMPORTANT: My SetStateRequest is NOT recognized by visual studio 2012, so unlike the above example it's not highlighted and actually red underlined with the "the type or namespace not found" message displayed when hovering Edit: I see the question got downvoted and I'm sorry if I'm missing something but I really have no more information to provide apart from the fact that I've spent 4 hours yesterday looking for this online (including stackoverflow) without any avail. I may be using the wrong search criteria or looking in the wrong places, but if that's the case could anyone at least point me in the right direction? I'm a beginner on all of this (both stackoverflow and crm2013) and I'm kind of stuck on this. Thanks again

@TITLE:RCP Start the product with Clear Workspace
@CONTENT:So I've come across this weird bug in RCP Apps. I've created a new RCP App with the Mail Template. I've added a new org.eclipse.ui.menus extension with a menuContribution with locationURI:toolbar:org.eclipse.ui.main.toolbar. To that, I've added a command with a little icon. Now, if I start the app without Clear Workspace in the Debug Configurations, my action appears AFTER the Quick Access text widget. Not only that, but a few other bugs come along (e.g. views aren't closing, too many views are opening at once). This is not a one-time thing, i.e. I have to start the app with Clear Workspace each time. This method of adding actions on the coolBar is non-deprecated. Why does it behave like a spoiled brat? Without Clear Workspace: With Clear Workspace:

@LINK:/questions/20638191/how-to-use-springs-i18n-mechanism
@TITLE:How to use Spring's i18n mechanism?
@CONTENT:I added localization to my Spring project and it appears to be working but I wonder how I change the language, if the language choice is done based on the browser setting, the HTTP header, a cookie or something else. Is there a way to be explicit as well e.g. taking the locale as a parameter in a way like e.g. hl=de on the HTTP query string? I also want to allow the user to set the language on a settings page, how can I do that? My implementation looks like this and writes messages in English: <h4 class="title"><fmt:message key="login.title"/></h4> servlet.xml: <bean id="messageSource"
      class="org.springframework.context.support.ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource">
    <property name="basename" value="classpath:messages" />
    <property name="defaultEncoding" value="UTF-8"/>
</bean>

<bean id="localeChangeInterceptor"
      class="org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.LocaleChangeInterceptor">
    <property name="paramName" value="lang" />
</bean>

<bean id="localeResolver"
      class="org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.CookieLocaleResolver">
    <property name="defaultLocale" value="en"/>
</bean>

<bean id="handlerMapping"

    <property name="interceptors">
        <ref bean="localeChangeInterceptor" />
    </property>
</bean>
 So how can I a) Make the locale choice explicit by enabling overriding the locale with a HTTP GET parameter such as hl=de for German and hl=fr for French? b) Let a user choose locale? Update The interceptor is not working. The XML is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@CONTENT:I am really trying hard to use coredata with a new IOS application. A real challenge is that since my background is SQL, I keep thinking in terms of SQLite rather than coredata. I've solved most hurdles, but this one stumps me -- I really want to create a SQLite view that returns a group_concat. Do I need to recreate this by coding on the results in objective-c, or is there a way to create a view or issue direct SQL using coredata objects? EDIT: Added data model and desired results Table_A; columns -- key, name (note -- key is not unique) Sample data: K1, N1 K1, N2 K1, N3 K2, N1 K2, N2 Desired results: K1, N1;N2;N3 K2, N1;N2 In SQLite this would be SELECT key, GROUP_CONCAT(name) from Table_A GROUP BY key

@TITLE:Adding a custom image onto a Navigation Drawer's center
@CONTENT:I'm experimenting for the first time with Android's Navigation Drawer. I think it is a very elegant way to provide an application menu. However, showing my prototype to some friends, it seems that it is not quit intuitive to search for a menu i) on the top left corner respectively ii) on the left side of the screen. To provide a "user hint" for case i), I added a custom image by creating an ActionBarDrawerToggle. This results in following design of the title bar (the little arrow is the cutom image, while the red star is the application icon): Now while developping, I thought this is quite obvious, but apparantly I'm wrong :). So as a second idea, to support a user to find option ii) described below, I tried to figure out how to add a further image at a specific place, which I want to explain with following image: Don't look at the design itself in the first place, but following: the image must be placed outside of the "view bounds" (when the navigation menu is hidden), and also exceed the navigation panel itself on the right side (always). Is this in any way possible without customize the entire navigation panel? I really wonder why I can't find much about this idea, since I think it is a very nice option to provide for the user (as long as the arrow don't disturbs the application usage)

 I think I'm so in my code, that I can no longer see my mistakes. It seems to be the same as my precedent question. But I can't solve it. Can you help me please ? In advance, thanks a lot for your answers. Regards, Tofuw EDIT - This is a really careless mistakes...

@TITLE:C code do¡Kwhile looping issue
@CONTENT:I'm currently experiencing issues concerning a do...while loop in my C code. The problem is that when I enter an incorrect value to store in dataTest[51] it DOES validate and states the problem (e.g. packet length over 50, only numbers). However when it prompts me again to enter a valid value I type a correct value and press enter, but the enter isn't recognized as me "entering" that data into the variable, it is recognized as a newline acting as if there isn't a value there. char dataTest[51];

do {

    int stp = 0;
    valid = 0;

    printf("\nPlease enter the packet data (maximum of 50 numbers): ");
    while(getchar()!='\n');

    scanf("%s", dataTest);

    length = strlen(dataTest);

    if(length <= 50) {

@LINK:/questions/20634016/sql-relationships-and-best-practices
@TITLE:SQL relationships and best practices
@CONTENT:If I have a User table and a Roles table. What is the usual practice/pattern for adding the relationship? Do I create an extra column in the User table for the RoleID or do people usually create a Relationships table like so: Relationships Table RelationshipID | UserID | RoleID |... any other relations a user might have
 for the last bit, as a user you might create an endless amount of different types of things that all need to be related to you... do you instead add the relationship to each individual table created for each individual thing.. for example: Pages Table PageID | Title | Content | Author (UserID)
 and so another table would also be similar to this: Comments Table CommentID | Comment | Author (UserID)
 In this case, I would need to expand upon the Relationships table if I were to do it that way: Relationships Table RelationshipID | UserID | RoleID | CommentID
 and i'd probably only want to fill in the UserID and CommentID as this relationship is not for the Roles... that is governed by another entry. so for example the values might be put in for a comment relationship: AUTO           | 2      | NULL   | 16
 I could imagine a multi purpose Revisions table being handy... Revisions Table RevisionID | DateCreated | UserID | ActionTypeID | ModelTypeID | Status | RelatedItemID
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1          | <Now>       | 3      | 4 (Delete)   | 6 (Page)    | TRUE   | 38
2          | <Now>       | 3      | 1 (Delete)   | 5 (Comment) | TRUE   | 10
3          | <Now>       | 3      | 1 (Add)      | 5 (Comment) | FALSE  | 10
 but not for a general Relationships table... Does this sound correct? Edit since comments: They stated that the relationships table should be made due to the many-to-many (data model) So let's take my previous example of my possible relationship table: Relationships Table Old RelationshipID | UserID | RoleID | CommentID... etc
 Should it actually be something more like this: Relationships Table New RelationshipID | ItemID        | LinkID     | ItemType    | LinkType | Status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1              | 23(PageID)    | 7(UserID)  | ("Page")    | ("User") | TRUE
2              | 22(CommentID) | 7(UserID)  | ("Comment") | ("User") | TRUE
3              | 22(CommentID) | 23(PageID) | ("Comment") | ("Page") | TRUE

@TITLE:Get Second Level features of social network through Twitter Api
@CONTENT:I am trying to get second level features of my twitter personal network using twitter4j library. When I refer to second level features I mean the followers of my followers, the followees of my followees etc. I've started with my followees first using the following code: try{
    twitter = tf.getInstance();
    long cursor = -1;
    IDs ids = twitter.getFriendsIDs(cursor);

    long[] id = ids.getIDs();
    ResponseList<User> users = twitter.lookupUsers(id); 
}
catch (Exception e) {
    logger.warn("Error {}",e.getLocalizedMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();
}
 Using the above I am getting my friends. But I am struggling to get the friends of friends. I've read that giving my twitter keys I am authorized to get second level features but not further that that. Any help is appreciated.
@CODE:try{
    twitter = tf.getInstance();
    long cursor = -1;
    IDs ids = twitter.getFriendsIDs(cursor);

    long[] id = ids.getIDs();
    ResponseList<User> users = twitter.lookupUsers(id); 
}
catch (Exception e) {
    logger.warn("Error {}",e.getLocalizedMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();

@LINK:/questions/20632760/wpf-easiest-way-to-add-control-to-grid-based-on-listview-selection
@TITLE:WPF: Easiest way to add control to grid based on ListView selection
@CONTENT:I have a ListView which contains items that should represent certain settings, which can be changed by the user. I am looking for the easiest way to link the ListViewItem to a custom user control. What I have now:     <ListView 
        Grid.Row="0" 
        Grid.Column="0"
        SelectionChanged="SettingsListViewSelectionChanged">

        <ListViewItem x:Name="PathSettings" Content="Path"/>
        <ListViewItem x:Name="HideShowTvShows" Content="Hide/Show TV Shows"/>
    </ListView>
 And then in the code behind I figure out which item was clicked, and attach the corresponding UserControl to the Grid.     private void SettingsListViewSelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        var listView = e.Source as ListView;

        if (listView != null)
        {
            SettingsContentPanel.Children.Clear();

            if (listView.SelectedItem.Equals(_pathSettings))
            {
                SettingsContentPanel.Children.Add(_pathSettings);

                _pathSettings.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, 0);
                _pathSettings.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, 1);
            }
            if (listView.SelectedItem.Equals(_hideShowTvShowsSettings))
            {
                SettingsContentPanel.Children.Add(_hideShowTvShowsSettings);

                _hideShowTvShowsSettings.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, 0);
                _hideShowTvShowsSettings.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, 1);
            }
        }
    }
 And the Grid itself:     <Grid 
        x:Name="SettingsContentPanel" 
        Grid.Row="0" 
        Grid.Column="2" 
        Grid.ColumnSpan="2" />
 Is there a way to get rid of the boiler plate code behind and use XAML for this purpose?
@CODE:ListView ListViewItem <ListView 
        Grid.Row="0" 
        Grid.Column="0"

        <ListViewItem x:Name="PathSettings" Content="Path"/>
        <ListViewItem x:Name="HideShowTvShows" Content="Hide/Show TV Shows"/>
    </ListView> UserControl Grid private void SettingsListViewSelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        var listView = e.Source as ListView;

        if (listView != null)
        {
            SettingsContentPanel.Children.Clear();

            if (listView.SelectedItem.Equals(_pathSettings))
            {
                SettingsContentPanel.Children.Add(_pathSettings);

                _pathSettings.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, 0);
                _pathSettings.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, 1);
            }
            if (listView.SelectedItem.Equals(_hideShowTvShowsSettings))
            {
                SettingsContentPanel.Children.Add(_hideShowTvShowsSettings);

                _hideShowTvShowsSettings.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, 0);
                _hideShowTvShowsSettings.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, 1);
            }

@TITLE:apache restlet connector overload
@CONTENT:I use restlet in camel route in from("restlet:http/myLink") clause. When user's requests more then ten per second, I begin recieve errors processing request like a "org.restlet.engine.connector.Controller run INFO: Connector overload detected. Stop accepting new work" I think, that error is caused by number of threads,request query's size or number,or something like that. I try set to maxThreads param different values in spring config  <bean id="restlet" class="org.apache.camel.component.restlet.RestletComponent">
    <property name="maxThreads" value="15"/>
 </bean>
 but I am not succeed. In documentation http://camel.apache.org/restlet.html I ddin't find ant param for setting size\number of request queue. I need help :( P.S. camel-restlet version is 2.12.2 Update I try to set big numbers to maxThreads,maxConnectionsPerHost,maxTotalConnections, but it's useless. If inject org.restlet.Component to camel's config like that:  <bean id="restletComponent" class="org.restlet.Component" />

<bean id="restlet" class="org.apache.camel.component.restlet.RestletComponent">
    <constructor-arg index="0">

 Via reflection, I get an instance of RelationURLList and I want to cast it to RelationBaseList<RelationBase>. Unfortunately, I can only cast it to RelationBaseList<RelationURL> RefTest obj = new RefTest();

 In cast1, I have the expected object, but cast2 is null. As I don't want to cast to each possibly derived class from RelationBase, I want to use the second cast (cast2). Any idea, how I can get the object, without casting to each single derived type?

@TITLE:Excel VBA code (assigned to a button) to hide/unhide rows based on cell values across multiple sheets
@CONTENT:this is my first post here and additionally I also have completely no knowledge on VBA whatsoever... so please excuse my ignorance ;-) I'm working on a price list which has a quantity column. The same files has multiple worksheets with multiple currencies. What I need to achieve is to create two buttons on each sheet to hide / unhide all rows where the quantity cell equals zero. So for example you want to select certain items from the list, so you enter the quantity into appropriate cells (quantity column) and press the button to hide all other rows for which the quantity equals zero. Now, I found the code for this somewhere already, but it only works on a first sheet and when I copy the sheet (to create another currency) with the buttons and press the button it will still apply the changes (hide / unhide rows) to the first sheet. This code is below: Public Sub HideRows()
Dim cell As Range

For Each cell In Range("BOQ")

cell.EntireRow.Hidden = (cell.Value = 0 And cell.Value <> "")
Next cell
End Sub
 and to unhide: Public Sub UnhideRows()
Dim cell As Range

For Each cell In Range("BOQ")

If (cell.Value = 0 And cell.Value <> "") Then cell.EntireRow.Hidden = False
Next cell
End Sub
 I would be extremely grateful if anyone could propose a proper script to do that separately on multiple sheets. Also to avoid the issue when after a print preview the script runs like a 100 times slower. Thanks in advance.
@CODE:Public Sub HideRows()
Dim cell As Range

For Each cell In Range("BOQ")

cell.EntireRow.Hidden = (cell.Value = 0 And cell.Value <> "")

More specifically my questions becomes: Which thread/task(s) at Kernel level correspond to the scheduler? Should it be 'scheduler' etc or Does any other task from kernel do its job? P.S.: "swapper" in kernel is an idle thread/task with lowest priority (halt) [1]. Does this do anything other than "step-down"? Does Linux create a dedicated instance of scheduler for each core in multi-core system? If no, then how it does on multicore? [1] Why do we need a swapper task in linux?

@TITLE:Android proguard enabled apk not connecting to azure server
@CONTENT:I have been looking a solution since last week. I have an application which is having a connection with windows azure server. I need to give my apk to clients so I am trying to encrypt my apk before the deployment. Right now I am using proguard and I can create the apk without any warning. But after installation,The device is not connecting to the server. Without proguard it is connecting. here is my on my MainActivity The Toast is displaying with an exception "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:The class representing the mobile serviceTable must have a single id property defined" while assigning the class          mClient = new MobileServiceClient(
                "https://uchek.azure-mobile.net/",
                "LslqFcIcUrlbLnYdDxTHUVrZBeQwPX81",
            con);

    try{

@TITLE:Implement ListView and YouTubeFailureRecoveryActivity together in android app
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement something like which would be ideally like this but since multiple inheritance is not supported, MyClass ABC extends ListActivity,YouTubeFailureRecoveryActivity{

}
 I am using now MyClass ABC extends YouTubeFailureRecoveryActivity{

}
 and implementing listView using something like this but it is not working,the app works well on 2.3 but crashes sometimes in 4.1 The app crashes in 4.1 at convertView = layoutInflator.inflate(R.layout.episode_list, null);
 Is interface the only solution or is there anything else can also be done ? Logcat 12-17 11:38:38.638: I/dalvikvm(31274):   at android.graphics.BitmapFactory.nativeDecodeAsset(Native Method)

@TITLE:Using Graph API instead of FQL for Facebook
@CONTENT:I have been google searching and stack trolling for something like this but can't seem to find the right formula so I thought I would ask .... What I'd like to do is use the Graph API rather then FQL - our application is running with php/graph api calls already, would like to keep it all together. Here is the FQL : SELECT url, 
normalized_url, share_count, like_count, comment_count, 
total_count,commentsbox_count, comments_fbid, 
click_count FROM link_stat WHERE url='http://www.google.com'
 Tried a bunch of different things, can't seem to translate it - I am going to assume that Link_stat doesn't exist in the graph api, as there is no doc's on it. Figure if it was possible someone might have accomplished it. Sample Of What I'd Like https://graph.facebook.com/XXXXX/?ids=http:google.com ( somethin like that )
@CODE:SELECT url, 
normalized_url, share_count, like_count, comment_count, 
total_count,commentsbox_count, comments_fbid,

@LINK:/questions/20627252/cassandra-handshake-and-internode-commmunication
@TITLE:Cassandra handshake and internode commmunication
@CONTENT:While trying to use the cassandra 2.0.1 version, i started facing the handshaking with version problem . There was an exception from OutboundTcpConnection.java stating that handshaking is not possible with a particular node. I had a look at the TCP dump and cleared off the doubts that there was no problem in the network layer. The application is not completing the handshaking process .Moreover , the port 7000 is still active. For example, all my 8 nodes are up . But when i try a nodetool status, some nodes give a DN- down node status. Later on, after examining , the TCP backlog queue was found overflowing and the particular server has stopped listening for other servers in the cluster. Am still not able to spot the root cause of this problem. Note: I have tried with previous version of cassandra , 1.2.4, and it was working ok at that time. Before going to production , i thought it is better to go to 2.0.x version to avoid a migration overhead mainly. Can anyone provide an idea on this ? Exception am getting is NFO [HANDSHAKE-/aa.bb.cc.XX] 2013-10-03 17:36:16,948 OutboundTcpConnection.java (line 385) Handshaking version with /aa.bb.cc.XX INFO [HANDSHAKE-/aa.bb.cc.YY] 2013-10-03 17:36:17,280 OutboundTcpConnection.java (line 396) Cannot handshake version with /aa.bb.cc.YY

@TITLE:WPF ListView/Gridview allow users to select multiple items and group them together
@CONTENT:I have a WPF ListView/GridViwe in a MVVM application. GridView is bound to a List in the ViewModel. The requirement is that the users should be able to select multiple rows of the gridview, right-click on it and see a context menu "Group These Together". Once selected, all these items should be collapsed into one group with a expander or + sign added at the beginning. Can somebody please help me in getting this working?

@TITLE:JavaFX can't load caspian.css
@CONTENT:I have a Maven project in which I use a javaxf WebEngine. I first included javafx by installing e(fx)clipse, and I was able to use it normally. Now I want to compile my program to a big .jar file with all dependencies included. I first used a <scope>system</scope> and linked to the jfxrt.jar in my JDK (1.7.0_45). I compile my program using mvm package and it works well for the build part. Then, I installed the jfxrt.jar in maven thanks to this SO answer so I have a javafx-2.2.45.jar with maven. However, I'm stuck with this error when I run my program and when it comes to instantiate that particular WebEngine: INFO: com.sun.javafx.css.StyleManager loadStylesheetUnPrivileged Could not find     stylesheet: jar:file:/target/project-name-0.1.one-jar.jar!/lib/javafx-2.2.45.jar!/com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/caspian/caspian.css

 I opened this jar and was able to find the caspian.css file where it's supposed to be. What should I do to be able to use my WebEngine in my "big compiled jar"? I don't care if the solution is a quick, dirty fix such as copy/paste of this css file somewhere else (I already tried that but I might have missed something..)

@TITLE:Join tables listing rows as columns joined to another table?
@CONTENT:I have 3 tables - things, defs, and info (terrible names, but significantly reduced for simplicity!) info CREATE TABLE `info` (
  `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `thingid` bigint(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `defid` bigint(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `data` longtext NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `infodata_coufie_ix` (`thingid`,`defid`)
);

id   | thingid  | defid   | data
1    | 1        | 1       | 1
1    | 1        | 2       | 25
1    | 2        | 1       | 0
1    | 2        | 3       | yellow
1    | 3        | 1       | 0
 defs CREATE TABLE `defs` (
  `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `datatype` varchar(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

1    | enabled | boolean
2    | size    | numeric

  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

id    | name
1     | bill
2     | terry
3     | nancy
 I'd like to be able to show the "defs"' value of "things", so a resultant table / view would be something like thingid | name   | enabled   | size   | colour
1       | bill   | true      | 25     | null
2       | terry  | false     | null   | yellow
3       | nancy  | true      | null   | null
 so the rows from defs would become column headers; the values matching those column headers for thingid would form the data for those rows. I've done this long ago in SQL Server, and for the life of me can't remember how to do it. I now need to do it in MySql5. I've been reading up and down http://www.artfulsoftware.com/infotree/queries.php and various SE articles but I've now confused the heck out of myself, so I have to actually ask someone.

 Edit: using the attributes name as string solved the problem but caused another, i ran into a infinit digest loop with the code above. <li ng-repeat="match in matches">
    <i class="pull-right [[getIconClass(match)]]"></i>
</li>
 getIconClass is a controller method which returns values from 1 to 6 depending on match.

@TITLE:Storing text file into a class
@CONTENT:I am currently trying to read in characters into a class that looks like this  struct data {
    string segment; string name;
    double length; double radius; double wall_thickness;
    double young_modulus; double compliance;

};
 I also have a vector that contains the following elements:   2A
  Aorta_Ascendens
  2
  1.47
  .164
  4
  53.4
  2B
  Aorta_Ascendens
  2
  1.44
  .161
  4
  51.0
  3A
 I want to read in the text file into each part, and currently this is my algorithm to continuously read through the text file and add each part respectively. int place = 0;

        while (place != temp_data.size()){
            int counter = 0;
            for (counter; counter <= 7; ++counter){
                istringstream is(temp_data[place + counter]);

                if (counter == 0){ is >> a.segment; }
                if (counter == 1){ is >> a.name; }
                if (counter == 2){ is >> a.length; }
                if (counter == 3){ is >> a.radius; }
                if (counter == 4){ is >> a.wall_thickness; }
                if (counter == 5){ is >> a.young_modulus; }
                if (counter == 6){ is >> a.compliance; }

            }
            counter = counter - 1;     //since the next segment is at    temp_data[7], must subtract one to have place = 7.
            place = counter + place;

            v.push_back(a);
        }
 The problem I ran into is trying to find a way to make sure the right part of the text goes into the right part of the object. for the first seven lines of text the object should be like this : segment: 2A
name: Aorta_Ascendens
length: 2
radius: 1.47
wall_thickness: .164
young modulus: 4
compliance: 53.4
 This should repeat the same way for the whole of the text file. temp_data is a vector that holds the elements that need to be added into the object, but I cant find a good way to continually cycle through the vector and put the elements into the right place. The algorithm I made has a counter and a place holder, the counter would cycle through the vector points and the place holder would hold spot for the first object's data member, in this case segment. At the end of the algorithm, place should equal the size of temp_data and get out of the loop. But I am having a problem when it compiles and runs, it seems to be putting the wrong element into the wrong object member. Any ideas?

    string segment; string name;

  3A int place = 0;

        while (place != temp_data.size()){
            int counter = 0;
            for (counter; counter <= 7; ++counter){
                istringstream is(temp_data[place + counter]);

        wdDoc.Selection.Paste
    End With

Next iCol

End Sub
 When I run this though, the line wdDoc.Selection.Paste gives the error: Run-time error '438': Object does not support this property or method. I'm also aware that this doesn't paste into table 1 of the document, but right now it doesn't do anything, so I thought I'd work on that first. I'm new to VBA but have other programming experience. Can someone please help me?

@TITLE:Does Java have any known issues with Images and displaying them
@CONTENT:I am new to Java but not new to graphics I'm trying to expand my understanding with a project in which I'm displaying many photos of items using JLabels and Icons to display them, The items pictures are garnished from various locations on the net and so many sources. I've converted these into PNG files as they have transparent backgrounds to them. Thing is I wasted a whole weekend recently checking and re-checking some code because one item just would not display, following the logic to its conclusion told me it was the file that was at fault, even though the file displayed correctly in photoshop? I went into the file to see what was unique about it, but apart from being 8 bit instead of 32 bit there was no difference I could find. ...and so to my question, does Java have problems with displaying any particular types of file formats that perhaps I should know prior to actually finding out the hard way. thanks in advance and sorry for no code as the question does not warrant it. I think the file that caused me problems was pulled from here http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/XXXX_Logo.png

I also would like it to not run server side, as there is no reason to incur unnecessary cost when I should be able to download directly from the URL... Basically, how Dropbox does it...

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Python library for rendering HTML and javascript 4 answers urllib2.urlopen("http://www.someURL.com/pageTracker.html").read();
 The code above will return the source HTML at http://www.google.com. What do I need to do to actually return the rendered HTML that you see when you visit google.com? I essentially trying to 'execute' a URL to trigger a view, not retrieve the HTML. To clarify a few things: I'm not actually concerned about the visual output of the page I'm concerned about the page rendering as it would inside of a proper browser so that I can track a Google Analytics goal via the JavaScript on that page.

@TITLE:How to I create an event for user entry?
@CONTENT:As part of my program I am asking the user for their name and their class (high school class). I am using a text entry function which is successfully accepting the input but I need help on validation: I only want the 'Enter' button to become active once the user has actually started typing as otherwise the user will press the 'Enter' button and deactivate it. Also, I would like to make sure that when they enter their name the program will only accept letters and no numbers at all. For the second entry (school class/tutor class) the user will enter something like 6A1 which is their class. There are about 10 different senior classes in my school so how can I either validate the entry to accept only 1 of these 10 classes or perhaps a drop down menu?

@TITLE:Is it possible to embed a MySQL database server into a Java servlet?
@CONTENT:I am in a situation where I am being asked to make a single WAR file that runs Wordpress. Using Quercus, Tomcat and httpd+mod_rewrite I was able to make a WAR file containing everything except the database, which I ran externally. However, I'm not sure how I might go about removing the dependency upon an external database (and, frankly, this whole endeavor seems like a bad idea to me). This article describes how Wordpress has been successfully deployed on the Google App Engine and hence without needing MySQL, but this was done using JPA. Instead of embedding a MySQL instance, if I could use an external MSSQL database connection instead that would be fine too. (This is an old post, but it seems to suggest that real MySQL is the only supported database for Wordpress.) Is the most viable option to attempt to replace each MySQL call in the Wordpress source code to a MSSQL call? Is there some kind of compatibility/translation layer that I could use instead? (I saw this question, but the solution will not work in my case.) UPDATE: I came across MySQL-JE, but it looks out of date and not quite complete enough (not sure how I would tell Quercus/PHP to communicate with it). Has anyone used it? If so, do you think it would help solve this problem?

@TITLE:how to split a file into multiple arrays, display them, and perform calculations on some arrays
@CONTENT:I have a question on how to split a file's data into multiple arrays and perform calculations on certain arrays. In my case, I need to read a hurricanes file and print out the name, year, category, pressure and windspeed each in its own array and then find the average of the category, pressure, and windspeed and then find out the number of a specific category, like Category 1: 26. I don't know how to do this. I used in.nextInt() but I assume it would print out all the numbers in the line of the file and then go on to the next and so on because when I ran my program, I got an error. How can I write a program like this? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Below is the file that I am trying to read from. hurcdata2.txt: 1980 Aug    945 100 Allen           2

@TITLE:Hooking into a running process to monitor its status
@CONTENT:I'm new to C# hooking and am looking for a little information on where to do my research. I figured there are some folks here who may have done this before that might have a good idea of where to start! My overall goal is simple- to create a C# application, if possible, that can search the current running processes on a machine for one matching a certain name (we can assume for this situation that it is unique, only 1 process of that name) and "hook" into the process. The goal would be to watch for that process to get hung up. If it crashes, freezes, or generally has any bad health event that windows is capable of detecting, I'd like to be able to find out about it. Then, based on what it sees, it does other stuff. I was able to do something similar in Python 2.7 using Pai Mei, but that project has been long abandoned and I've grown rather fond of C# in the recent years. So: Does this sound like something that is possible in C#? If so, does anyone have a good suggestion on where I can find some information on it? And finally, does anyone have some example code laying around they might be willing to share on the topic? =D Thank you!

@TITLE:Intent.EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY doesnt work
@CONTENT:What I'm trying to do in my application is to let the user choose a picture from his phone's gallery. The code I'm using is as follows: Intent intentBrowseFiles = new Intent();
    intentBrowseFiles.setType("image/*");
    intentBrowseFiles.setAction(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
    intentBrowseFiles.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY, true);
    startActivityForResult(Intent.createChooser(intentBrowseFiles,"Select Picture"), SHOW_GALLERY); 
 By putting : intentBrowseFiles.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY, true); 
 I thought this would only fire the gallery intent, but instead user is left with the selection of his drive, dropbox and other online accounts along with the local gallery... I don't want any other remote resources, is there something that I'm missing here?
@CODE:Intent intentBrowseFiles = new Intent();

@TITLE:SDL mouse events are not being handled quick enough
@CONTENT:I've been playing around with SDL for a few days now, and while I think I got the hang of it, I've run into a small problem with the menu. More specifically, the buttons in the menu. They work flawlessly when the mouse isn't moving that fast, but when I speed it up a bit (moving the cursor between the buttons, constantly making the button redraw from "normal" sprite to "mouse-over sprite"), it lags behind, sometimes doesn't update at all and small bugs start appearing. This is all my code regarding the management of buttons and events in general: while(!Exit)
{
while(SDL_PollEvent(&Ev))
    {

        curTime = SDL_GetTicks();
        if((ControlVar == 1 && Ev.type == SDL_MOUSEMOTION) || (ControlVar == 1 && Ev.type == SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN) || (ControlVar == 1 && Ev.type == SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP)) {
            But1.doAction();
            But2.doAction();
            But3.doAction();

                if(curTime > lastTime + 25) {
                SDL_RenderClear(Screen);
                ApplyImage("Menu.png");

                But1.Draw();
                But2.Draw();
                But3.Draw();

                SDL_RenderPresent(Screen);
                lastTime = SDL_GetTicks();
            }

        }

        if(Ev.type == SDL_QUIT)
            Exit = true;
    }
SDL_Delay(10);

@TITLE:How to set user_id on Entity update?
@CONTENT:I have entity with updatedAt and updatedBy audit fields. I want to set this fields only if entity state was changed. So, for dirty checking I can use either Hibernate EmptyInterceptor interface (overriding onFlushDirty() method) or JPA listeners (@PreUpdate). But how I can get current userId inside interceptor or listener? To my mind comes 2 solutions: Pass userId to DAO layer, so I can create custom interceptor passing to it constructor userId and then use this interceptor when creating new Session. Set current userId to public-static ThreadLocal variable so I have access to it from any place. But I think both approaches are ugly. So may be there is exist some more elegant way to solve my problem? Please note, I can't use Envers library (it don't fit our project requirements). Thanks.

@TITLE:Inserting data into a Access Database
@CONTENT:I am having trouble with a exercise I am working on with Java using a Access Database, wondering if anyone could shed some light on this In my main class I make a call like this Product p = new Product("test", "Test Product", 49.50);
insertProduct(p);
 This calls the insertProduct(p); method. What I am trying to do is insert some test data into the database, here is my code for that. public static void insertProduct(Product p)
{
    try
    {
        System.out.println("Insert test: ");

        String insertProduct = "INSERT INTO Products (ProductCode, Description, Price) VALUES ('andr', 'Beginning Android', '38.99')";
        PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(insertProduct);
        ps.setString(1, p.getCode());
        ps.setString(2, p.getDescription());
        ps.setDouble(3, p.getPrice());
        ps.executeUpdate();

        ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();

        rs.next();
        String productCode = rs.getString(1);
        String description = rs.getString(2);
        double price = rs.getDouble(3);

        p = new Product(productCode, description, price);


        printProduct(p);
        System.out.println();

    }
    catch(SQLException e)
    {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
 when I run this I get a Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException and can't figure out what is going on, I know that when I run the debugger and step through the method, it crashes at the beginning of this statements ps.setString(1, p.getCode());
ps.setString(2, p.getDescription());
ps.setDouble(3, p.getPrice());
ps.executeUpdate();

@TITLE:AFNetworking addOperation getting locked
@CONTENT:I'm using AFNetworking 1.3.3 and running into an issue i'm unsure how to debug. Below is the stack trace. The issue so far only reproduce during unit test, but that probably points to a design issue that will cause issue at some other "random" times, so I want to figure it out. Below is the stack trace, there is no output in the log and the app just stay there. It seems to me that the app is in dead lock, but i can't figure out why it would be. Edit: one detail i missed is that the execution pointed indicates: EXC_BAD_ACCESS(code = 1, address=xxxxxx)
 Any pointers appreciated, thanks, olivier Thread 1, Queue : com.apple.main-thread

@TITLE:How to create users and store them in a database and link them to windows authentication logins
@CONTENT:What I want: An intranet application where only people who are logged in can see the application... and an Admin and Member role. 1: I have created an MVC 5.0 web application (for intranet). It has a Home view with a home controller... I have an Admin view with an admin controller. The home page has a link (well it's not a link yet but whatever) on it that is conditional: @if(User.IsInRole("Admin")){
    <li>Admin</li> @*Will be link to admin controller action*@
}
 I would like to create 1 user with role of "Admin" and allow him/her to then create new users (assigning them to Windows authentication logins) with a username and a new role of either "Admin" or "Member"... 2: Next, I want to make it so that the users with Admin role can do all of the stuff denoted in my SQL database with the roles that be-fit them. For example, John only has read and write access to some of the tables ("Member") But Jack and Jill have read and write access to all of the tables ("Admin"). John cannot see the Admin link on the Home view, but Jill can. The Admin controller action is locked down to only allow users with "Admin" as the role, not "Member"... The Core question (with 1 and 2 in mind): I realise that there are two sets of authentication here, one for windows authentication for the application itself, and then one for the database, but I have a funny feeling they should be linked in some way. I have read quite a bit of material but am consistently confused with it, coming from a Web Form authentication skill set, It's my first intranet application... bit confused. What I've done so far: I have currently got Windows Authentication enabled, and I can successfully use the application and call upon: @User.Identity.Name
 to find out who I am... Side Notes: I would like to understand in what context the Authorize parameters are to be used eg. [Authorize(Roles="Admin")]
@CODE:@if(User.IsInRole("Admin")){
    <li>Admin</li> @*Will be link to admin controller action*@
} @User.Identity.Name [Authorize(Roles="Admin")]

@LINK:/questions/20619331/how-can-i-refine-this-javascript-code-so-it-ignores-links-from-images
@TITLE:How can I refine this Javascript code so it IGNORES links from images
@CONTENT:This is a variation of an existing question {Please note - this question is the opposite/inverse of an existing StackOverflow question that is too complex to answer there} From the very beginning I want to make some refinement to some code from this challenge: // the new base url
var base = ' https://www.example.co.uk/gp/wine/order?ie=UTF8&asin=';
var links  = document.getElementsByTagName('a');

for(var i = 0;i < links.length;i++){
    // check each link for the 'asin' value
    var result = /asin=([\d\w]+)/.exec(links[i].getAttribute('href'));
    if(result){
        // make a new url using the 'base' and the 'asin' value
        links[i].setAttribute('href', base+result[1]);
    }
}
 Now, instead of it acting on all links, can I get it to only look at links that are from text? Here is an HTML snippet to show what I mean: <a href="/shop/product?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=Z00FDLN878&amp;tab=UK_Default" target="_blank"><img width="125" height="125" border="0" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/01W9a7gwosL.jpg" alt="43453"></a>
 That's an image link - I do NOT want it to act on that.
@CODE:// the new base url
var base = ' https://www.example.co.uk/gp/wine/order?ie=UTF8&asin=';
var links  = document.getElementsByTagName('a');

for(var i = 0;i < links.length;i++){
    // check each link for the 'asin' value
    var result = /asin=([\d\w]+)/.exec(links[i].getAttribute('href'));
    if(result){
        // make a new url using the 'base' and the 'asin' value
        links[i].setAttribute('href', base+result[1]);
    }
} <a href="/shop/product?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=Z00FDLN878&amp;tab=UK_Default" target="_blank"><img width="125" height="125" border="0" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/01W9a7gwosL.jpg" alt="43453"></a>

@CONTENT:I have an old ASP Classic application running in my company's SaS project. What it does is export a major report in an excel spreadsheet. The problem is: surprisingly enough, it happens to work perfectly in... IE. All of the versions. Chrome seems to go over the Response.ContentType instruction, and attempts to save the resulting file in a .ASP file format... which goes badly, of course. Until now, all we've been doing is asking our fellow clients and support attendants to simply change their browsers to an old, unreliable browser (e.g. IE). However, we've just sold a project to a client whose browser was officialy locked as being Google Chrome. So... I have no idea as of how to solve this problem. My ContentType instruction is     Response.ContentType = "application/vnd.ms-excel"
 And it goes on below, creating the table with a common html structure. Help please!! :D

@CONTENT:I have the following class: struct EdgeExtended {

};
 I want to have a vector of such objects, sort it by neighborNodeId. Then I want to search for a particular neighborNodeId and return a reference to the found object inside the vector by binary search. Previously I used a map for that, so it was something like that: map<int, EdgeExtended> neighbours;
.....

auto it = neighbours.find(dnodeId);
if (it != neighbours.end()) {
    edgeMap = it->second; 
}
 Instead of map<int, EdgeExtended> neighbours;
 I want to have vector<EdgeExtended> neighbours;
 and retain as much as the old code the same. I want to benchmark if the vector is faster than the map, since I am building thousands of vectors(or maps) and each vector (map) is relatively small (~10 items). I do not know how to a) make objects sortable by neighborNodeId and b) how to use binary search that searches for a particular member of the class (neighborNodeId). Sorry for the noob question. I am counting on your help.

@TITLE:Retrieving data from web service and populating SQLite3 database efficiently
@CONTENT:I am currently developing an app that that will be used by association members that are going to a large annual conference. The app will pull data from a database that is created by the app and populate it via a web service. The web service is split into 8 pages (this will likely go up). Each page represents a table in the database. The app will have several table views that will be populated by data in one or more of the tables in the database. What I need is a the best method for going through the list of tables, connecting to their respective web service pages and then populating the respective database tables. This updating needs to take place in the background so the UI doesn't become unresponsive and/or show a downloading/updating/waiting kind of status. So far I have a static array of the table names and have a loop that goes through the array and appends a URL string with the names, for example: -(void)startUpdate
{
NSArray* tableNames =  @[@"speaker", @"exhibitor", @"workshop", @"workshopspeakers", @"schedule", @"location", @"feedback", @"note", @"usage", @"user"];

NSUInteger loopCount = tableNames.count;

for (int i = 0; i < loopCount; ++i){
    NSString *tableName = [tableNames objectAtIndex:i];   
    [self fetchObjectsWithTableName:[tableName mutableCopy] completion:^(NSArray* objects, NSError*error){
        if (error) {
        } else {
        }
    }];
}
}
 fetchObjectsWithTableName method then has the connections and retrieves the data: -(void)fetchData:(NSString *)tableName
                    withCompletion:(completion_t)completionHandler
{
NSString *currentURL = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"https://testapi.someURL.com/api/congress/%@", tableName];
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:currentURL]];
[request addValue:@"application/json" forHTTPHeaderField:(@"Accept")];
[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:request
                                   queue:[[NSOperationQueue alloc] init]
                       completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *error)
 {
     NSError* err = error;
     NSArray* objects; // final result array as a representation of JSON Array
     if (response) {
         NSHTTPURLResponse *newResp = (NSHTTPURLResponse*)response;
         if (newResp.statusCode == 200) {
             NSLog(@"FetchData - Status code = %li", (long)newResp.statusCode);
             if ([data length] >0 && error == nil)
             {
                 NSError* localError;
                 objects = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:kNilOptions error:&error];
                 if (objects) {
                     if (completionHandler) {
                         completionHandler(objects, nil);
                     }
                     //NSLog(@"Objects in current table - %@ = %@", tableName, objects);
                     [self.tables addObject:objects];
                   //  NSLog(@"Tables now = %@", self.tables);
                     NSLog(@"FetchData - Objects in current table - %@ = %lu", tableName, (unsigned long)objects.count);
                     return;
                 } else {
                     err = localError;
                 }
             } else {

                 return;

             }
         }
         NSLog(@"FetchData - Response code not 200@");
     }
     if (objects == nil) {

         if (completionHandler) {
             completionHandler(nil, err);
         }
     }
}];

}
 This currently goes through the array of table names, makes a connection based on each one and pulls back JSON data and stores it in a temporary array 'objects'. I think what I need now is that in each iteration of this 'objects' array is copied to the relevant table in the database, i.e. 'speaker' table name makes a connection: https://testapi.someURL.com/api/congress/speaker and the JSON is entered into the database under the table 'speaker'. How and where do I do that? Will I need to add a completion handler to startUpdate? If so, how? I don't understand completion handlers despite looking at several examples. Thanks.

@TITLE:double if conditioning in r language syntax [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Error in if/while (condition) {: missing Value where TRUE/FALSE needed 1 answer What is the correct way of writing if syntax on R? With: for ( i in 1:200 ) {
     if( (time[i]<731) | (time[i]==NA) ) { x[i] <- NA }
}
 I keep getting: missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
 The idea is to cut the beginning of the time series to calculate statistics. x and time are both numeric. Also this question is not an exact duplicate, the other post was dealing with a && statement and no foo==NA but foo==0. I thought that | or || would work like (TRUE | NA) = TRUE but it seems I was wrong.
@CODE:for ( i in 1:200 ) {
     if( (time[i]<731) | (time[i]==NA) ) { x[i] <- NA }
} missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed x time

@TITLE:How do I programmatically/automatically change the text formatting for the text of a Visio shape after I am done with the editing?
@CONTENT:Here is what I want to achive: I want to use Visio to document a project. I have some Visio text boxes that contain code examples. The code examples have comments in them. The comments are line comments (either the line begins with # or they are places at the end of the line beginning with # What I need is to have Visio change the comments to another color automatically after I am done with the editing of that shape (a text square). From what I read this can be achieved with the following: -use "TheText" event and CALLTHIS("Function-name") -the "Function-name" procedure should read the text of the shape and search for "#" on each line and turn the text on that line to let's say "grey" till the end of the line. Could you please confirm me if I am on the right path with this? I am a totally beginner with Visio and VBA. To test the above I used a Macro that should move the shape as soon as the editing is done Sub Macro() 'Enable diagram services
Dim DiagramServices As Integer
DiagramServices = ActiveDocument.DiagramServicesEnabled
ActiveDocument.DiagramServicesEnabled = visServiceVersion140

ActiveWindow.DeselectAll
ActiveWindow.Select Application.ActiveWindow.Page.Shapes.ItemFromID(88), visSelect
Application.ActiveWindow.Selection.Move 0.5, 0#


'Restore diagram services
ActiveDocument.DiagramServicesEnabled = DiagramServices
 End Sub And "TheText" event cell had this =CALLTHIS("ThisDocument.Macro") I expected the shape to move to right as soon as I was done with the editing but it did not happen What am I doing wrong? thanks a lot P

@TITLE:BigQuery Schema error despite updating schema
@CONTENT:I'm trying to run multiple simultaneous jobs in order to load around 700K record to a single BigQuery table. My code (Java) creates the schema from the records of is job, and updates the BigQuery schema, if needed. Workflow is as follows: A single job creates the table and sets the (initial) schema. For each load job we create the schema from the records of the job. Then we pull the existing table schema from BigQuery, and if it's not a superset of the schema associated with the job, we update the schema with the new merged schema. The last part (starting from pulling the existing schema) is synced (using a lock) - only one job performs it at a time. The update of the schema is using the UPDATE method, and the lock is released only after the client update method returns. I was expecting to avoid encountering schema update errors using this workflow. I'm assuming that once the client returns from the update job, then the table is updated, and that jobs that are in process can't be hurt from the schema update. Nevertheless, I still get schema update errors from time to time. Is the update method atomic? How do I know when a schema was actually updated?

@TITLE:Accept browser permission dialog with behat/mink
@CONTENT:I'm using Behat with Mink. Currently I'm working on building a test for webrtc. The issue is that webrtc has a browser permission dialog where the user has to select that they do want to share their media. As this permission is from the browser itself instead of html I don't know how to accept it with mink or even if that's possible. Is there any work around or standard solution for this? I imagine the same issue holds true for anything a browser requires user permissions to use.

@CODE:autoplay iframe "autoplay=1" iframe Autoplay on most mobile platforms (Android, iOS) gets blocked to avoid poor user experiences - video should only play following a user action. You can usually work around it by triggering the play() on another event (eg the onloaded event)

 I created the hidden field in the form and got it in the uploadhanndler.php. /files/'.$_POST['customer'].'

I realized I could use the PHP user directories, and the files are beeing saved in a folder like this 6afa0f7338b14aeed39eb7656f364b4e that comes from the session_id(), I tried then to change the session_id() with the number of the folder I want this way at the begining of the /index.php?customer=160 session_start();
session_id($_GET['customer']);
 but the files are still beeing saved in folder 6afa0f7338b14aeed39eb7656f364b4e, and when I print the session_id() is 160. PHP user directories is a good method to achieve what I want? what I am doing wrong? Thanks in advance and excuse my poor english.

@TITLE:ActionBar with NoTitleBar Theme.Holo.Light
@CONTENT:I have an Android tabbed app. I don't want anything else other than the tabs to be displayed at the top of the screen. This works alright, the only problem is that, when launching the app, for a short moment < 1sec, I can see the title bar with the application launcher icon. Why is this happening, is there a way to prevent this? styles.xml <resources>

@TITLE:Using AnsiString like byte of array in Delphi XE4
@CONTENT:Trying to move Delphi 2007 project to XE4. In Delphi 2007 I was using function that reads byte array from socket using Indy directly. I passed AnsiString casted to array of byte to var parameter of this function: var data:AnsiString;
AContext.Connection.IOHandler.ReadBytes(TIDBytes(Data), PacketLength-PacketLengthDelta-1, False);
 In Dlphi XE when I try to concatinate Data to another string I got access violation error. Now I'm trying to simulate this problem in more simple code: TIdBytes = array of Byte;

procedure fill(var b: TIDBytes);
begin
setlength(b,5);
b[0]:=61;
b[1]:=61;
b[2]:=61;
b[3]:=61;
b[4]:=61;

//original function used move function
end;



procedure TMainForm.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
var s: ansistring ;
begin
fill( TIDBytes(s) );
Showmessage(s);
end;
 Now I expect to see something like ==== in message box, but I got empty one. I supposed that XE AnsiString acts the same like Delphi 2007 Ansistring and you can use them like byte array in both cases. What is the best way to solve filling AnsiString with bytes problem?
@CODE:Delphi 2007 XE4 Delphi 2007 Indy AnsiString var data:AnsiString;
AContext.Connection.IOHandler.ReadBytes(TIDBytes(Data), PacketLength-PacketLengthDelta-1, False); Dlphi XE Data access violation TIdBytes = array of Byte;

@TITLE:Windows Phone 8 - Twitter API
@CONTENT:I am doing some research and can't seem to find a definitive way to query Twitter's API to get a user's tweets on WP8 using C#. The twitter user isn't my own account and all I want to do is retrieve tweets and not post any tweets. Do I therefore need to Authenticate myself/my app? Is the TweetSharp library appropriate for my objective?

@LINK:/questions/20610014/converting-xml-into-string-cdata-in-xslt
@TITLE:Converting XML into String (CDATA) in XSLT
@CONTENT:I have been using Altova Map Force to build XSL transformations recently, and I have come across an issue. In order to create a valid XML output file (from an input text file, which was simple enough to build), it needs to contain some xmlns attribute tags. Unfortunately, I cannot find a way to do this validly (modified the output xsd schema def and attribute forcing) within Map Force or my Data Transformation Tool (built by the client I am building this for, based on Saxon). So, my solution is to parse the generated XML into another (final) transformer where the XML Elements of the File are transformed into a single text block that contains a string representation of the XML (i.e. the file string that is returned), then trim off the parent element declaration, and modify it with the amended element (with the xmlns attribute), then output that to save. I have done some tests, and I can do this validly, but in that test, I was parsing in a pre-converted xml string that had the function applied to it. So, can anyone advise me as to how, within xslt, I can convert a collection of elements into a string that I can modify and return as CDATA (which the transformer program will convert treat as a string and dump it straight into the output file)?

 Using another method to get address():        public String address(double lt,double lg) throws IOException{
        Geocoder geocoder;
        List<Address> addresses;
        geocoder = new Geocoder(this, Locale.getDefault());

        String address = addresses.get(0).getAddressLine(0);
        String city = addresses.get(0).getAddressLine(1);
        String country = addresses.get(0).getAddressLine(2);
        return address +"\n"+ city +"\n"+ country;
    }       
 To get current location on map using InitializeMap():     private void initilizeMap() {
    if (googleMap == null) {

        CameraPosition cameraPosition = new CameraPosition.Builder().target(
                new LatLng(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude())).zoom(12).build();

        googleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition(cameraPosition));

        MarkerOptions marker = new MarkerOptions().position(new LatLng(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude())).title("Hello Maps ");
        googleMap.addMarker(marker);
        googleMap.isMyLocationEnabled();
        // check if map is created successfully or not
        if (googleMap == null) {
            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),

  = render @courses
 By the way, in another place (on homepage /static_pages/home.html.slim), this same code snippet results in other ordering. So, I am wondering, maybe it is some kind of caching problem.... What might be the problem? Thank you in advance!

 I'm trying to guide myself by this tutorial: http://www.w3bees.com/2013/09/jquery-infinite-scroll-with-php-mysql.html, but as you can see it has no ajax.request, it is all done in PHP. My current listview_A code is the following: <ul data-role="listview" id="listview_A" data-inset="true" data-mini="true">
    <li style="height: -2px; background-color: #666666"></li>
</ul>
 With the jQuery I do append more items to the <ul> tag further than the one (by default) that is there. Said this, I really don't know where to start adapting that tutorial to my code, can you guys give me some lights? Thanks. Edit: Solved. See the answer below.
@CODE:$(document).on("pagebeforeshow", "#page-main", function(){
    get_simple_info();
});
function get_simple_info(){
    var info = "";
    $.getJSON('classes/load.php', function(data){
        $.each(data, function(index, item) 
        {
            info += "<li id='" + item.id + "'><p>" + item.name + "</p></li>";
        });
        $("#listview_A").append(info); 
        $("#listview_A").trigger("change");
        $("#listview_A").listview("refresh");
    });
} $query = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY ID DESC LIMIT 15");
$query->execute();
$query->bind_result($id, $name);
$query->store_result();
$rows = array();
while($query->fetch()){
    $rows[] = array("id" => $id, "name" => $name);
}
$query->close();
$db->close();
return json_encode($rows); <ul data-role="listview" id="listview_A" data-inset="true" data-mini="true">
    <li style="height: -2px; background-color: #666666"></li>
</ul> <ul> tag

@CONTENT:I'm using PHP and MySQL. I have a users table and a groups table. My question is, how can I implement a system in groups so that I can acces all the users id's which are part of that group. Example: I have John, Mary and Alex in the users table. John is id 1, Mary is 2 and Alex is 3. Now how can I add these users to the group users? I can't just add fields like "user_1", "user_2", "user_3". What if the group has 1000 members?

#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/issue
sleep 3

//b.sh
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/issue
echo "before sleep"
sleep 3
 my C program: #include <stdio.h>

      int t = pclose(fl);
      printf("%d\n", t);
      return 0;
}  
 next, i will compile and run this program as 4 steps: case 1: comment line 2¡A then compile and run, the program do not print 0 until the shell cmd terminate. case 2: comment line 1¡A then compile and run, the program will terminate right now and it print 13, that is to say the exit status of pclose is 13, i look up the linux errno: 13 EACCES +Permission denied
 samebody would help me and tell me the reason? thanks.

@TITLE:Why Gerrit is accepting pushes, it can't handle?
@CONTENT:Following comments to this answer and information if Gerrit's docs. If adding proper refs is mandatory: git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master
 Then why Gerrit is accepting at all a push without them? After doing git push origin master with proper refs missing, push is accpeted (at Git level), but no change is created (at Gerrit level). User is ending up with a mess in code review system (can't merge non-existing change, can't push nothing else, because he or she is getting no changes reject) and must do a lot of strange things to fix this problem. What is the reason or logic for implementing a feature, that such commit will be accepted? Why Gerrit isn't rejecting pushes, that it can't handle at all?

@TITLE:Why Gerrit is unable to create branch by itself?
@CONTENT:Following this answer and my own question, I have a simple (hope so) question. If I'm pushing a particular branch, with all required refs properly set: git checkout 82-blah-blah
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/82-blah-blah
 Why do I always get: ! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/for/82-blah-blah (branch 82-blah-blah not found)
 and I always have to go to Gerrit's UI and create that branch manually? Isn't that an obvious step, that Gerrit could simply automate? Or am I missing something?
@CODE:git checkout 82-blah-blah
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/82-blah-blah ! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/for/82-blah-blah (branch 82-blah-blah not found) git checkout -b <branch> origin/master git push origin <branch>

@TITLE:How to have a browser window inside an app? (see descriptions for better explanation)
@CONTENT:This is what I'm trying to achieve: If you see my image, I need to have navigation that links to a few external websites.. But I need my navigation to ALWAYS stay there (not open up a new window). First thought you think... "Ok, I'll just stick in some iframes with some link targets on some anchor tags and call it a day-" Well, that's what I thought too, but because of a nasty invention called target="_blank" <!-- I think its nasty... -->
 located on a few links in the external site, it will exit out from my web app and open up an entirely new window leaving my once was "app" as just another page in website history. The ONLY thing that I can think of now is doing something like my image suggests... Have some sort of native wrapper, browser window 90% down the page and navigation 10% from bottom (not part of the browser window) that tells what links to load up into the browser. Here is my first attempt w/ the iFrames (FAILED): http://jsfiddle.net/zmx9e/ Click the "External Link" in red to and click the other link (that opens a new window) to see my problem in action. Does anyone have any suggestions for a Front-end guy? I'm willing to try anything.

List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();
 If not then why in java 7 dimond operator ie <> is introduced to avoid type writing at right side of '=' or at object creation side.
@CODE:List<Integer> l = new ArrayList(); //and 

List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>(); dimond operator <> '='

@TITLE:A couple more SWIG warnings
@CONTENT:I am trying to create some ruby wrappers around a c++ library. I have most of it working, but I have a few Warnings that I would like to fix. The issues are with 2 header files, here are the snips of code typedef std::set<WParm,std::less<WParm> > WParmlistType;
typedef WParmlistType::iterator  WParmlistIter;

class WParmlist : public WParmlistType {
 and the warning I get ... Warning 401: Nothing known about base class 'WParmlistType'. Ignored. and the second header is similar : typedef std::vector<WString> WEditType;
typedef WEditType::iterator  WEditIter;

class WEdit : public WEditType {
 with a similar warning: Warning 401: Nothing known about base class 'WEditType'. Ignored. I had seen this type of warning before, but that was related to inheritance from std::string. Those caused real problems in that I was unable to get the returned string values. I was able to get past that by using %include std_string.i, thanks to the answer found here : swig Nothing known about base class 'std::string', ignored . I was thinking there was some other directive I may need to handle the typedefs in this situation.
@CODE:typedef std::set<WParm,std::less<WParm> > WParmlistType;

@LINK:/questions/20600886/configuring-mysql-connection-in-google-app-engine-php-sdk-on-windows-7
@TITLE:Configuring MySQL connection in Google App Engine PHP SDK on Windows 7
@CONTENT:Need basic help configuring Google App Engine SDK on a Windows 7 system to use a local install of MySQL. The GAE install is vanilla (GAE 1.8.8, Python 2.7.6, PHP 5.4), with MySQL 5.6.15 also installed. I am able to use the MySQL console, so MySQL is running. PHP is also running. When I run a short PHP script consisting almost entirely of this line: $dbconn = mysql_connect('localhost','root','rootpwd');
 this is the error message I get: Warning: mysql_connect(): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
 My question: What settings do I need to add or change to allow my PHP scripts to connect to MySQL? My root username and password are correct, as verified by my ability to access MySQL through the console. There are some difference between the GAE SDK setup and that of a WAMP server, which I also have installed on the same machine but which is not running now. Is there still likely to be a conflict between the freshly installed MySQL instance and the one on the WAMP server? Are there some environment variables (in Windows, in the SDK, or elsewhere) that I need to set? I'm fairly sure this question has been asked before, but the answers I am seeing are either more complex than I can believe would be necessary, or simply gloss over the details of configuring the connection. Any help would be appreciated. FIGURED IT OUT... Apparently my script was being pointed to the MySQL instance from the WAMP server, which was not running when I tried to connect in the script. As soon as I started that MySQL instance, the script connected to it. So the moral of the story is... if you already have a MySQL instance installed outside of the GAE SDK, as long as that service is running your GAE PHP script will find it, and there's no need to install another MySQL instance just for the Google SDK.

@TITLE:Why are search results not limited to the Bounding Box?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to do a simple places search within a specified rectangle area. My assumption was that the boundingBox Parameter for the findPlaces() method was to limit the search results to the specified rectangular area. But when I do a search with a specified boundingBox I get results all over the map. That's essentially what I'm doing: //create coordinates
var mapCenter = map.center;
var topLeft = new nokia.maps.geo.Coordinate(mapCenter.latitude + .005, mapCenter.longitude - .01);
var bottomRight = new nokia.maps.geo.Coordinate(mapCenter.latitude - .005, mapCenter.longitude + .01);

//create bounding box
var bBox = new nokia.maps.geo.BoundingBox(topLeft, bottomRight);

//create rectangle
var searchRectangle = new nokia.maps.map.Rectangle(bBox);
map.objects.add(searchRectangle);

//do the search
nokia.places.search.manager.findPlaces({
searchTerm: "Starbucks",
onComplete: processResults,
boundingBox: bBox
});
 Unfortunately I can't post any Images. But basically what I get is a rectangle at the center of the map and many Markers inside but also outside of the rectangle. Why is that? Edit: I noticed that when I enter a searchterm like "food" rather than "Starbucks" (where "food" obviously gets more results) most of the results are actually inside the rectangle. But still some arent. Also after experimenting with different terms it looks like the search manager always tries to return 20 results. It just starts to look for places inside the rectangle but when it can't find no more results it also looks outside till it found 20. Is that correct? If yes, how can I make it only search inside the rectangle?
@CODE://create coordinates
var mapCenter = map.center;

The client sends a request, server catches it, processes and sends a reply. The reply is never delivered. In the minimal test case client and server simply sends empty messages, so the problem isn't in the message construction or processing code. If I change the roles, and run server on Windows and Client on Linux, everything works OK. If I start PUB server on Linux and the SUB client on Windows, none of the messages is delivered. I use Linux Ubuntu 12.04 LTS amd64, ZeroMQ 4.0.3 and g++ 4.6.3 on server side and Windows 8.1 x64, Visual Studio 2013 RC and clrzmq NuGet package 2.2.5 on the client side.

@TITLE:Parsing graph data file with Python
@CONTENT:I have one relatively small issue, but I can't keep to wrap my head around it. I have a text file which has information about a graph, and the structure is as follows: first line contains the number of nodes a blank line is used for separation information about nodes follows, each chunk is separated from another by the empty line chunks contain the node id one one line, type on second, and information about edges follows there are two types of edges, up and down, and first number after node types denotes number of "up" edges, and their IDs follow in line after (if that number is 0, no "up" edges exist and the next number denotes the "down" edges) same goes for the "down" edges, number of them and their ids in line below So, sample data with two nodes is: 3

1
1
2
2 3
0

2
1
0
2
1 3

3
2
1
1
1
2
 So, node 1 has type 1, two up edges, 2 and 3, and no down edges. Node 2 has type 1, zero up edges, and 2 down edges, 1 and 3 Node 3 has type 2, one up edge, 1, and 1 down edge, 2. This info is clearly readable by human, but I am having issues writing a parser to take this information and store it in usable form. I have written a sample code: f = open('C:\\data', 'r')
lines = f.readlines()
num_of_nodes = lines[0]
nodes = {}
counter = 0
skip_next = False
for line in lines[1:]:
    new = False
    left = False
    right = False
    if line == "\n":
        counter += 1
        nodes[counter] = []
        new = True
        continue
    nodes[counter].append(line.replace("\n", ""))
 Which kinda gets me the info split for each node. I would like something like a dictionary, which would hold the ID, up and down neighbors for each (or False if there are none available). I suppose that I could now parse through this list of nodes again and do each on its own, but I am wondering can I modify this loop I have to do that nicely in the first place.

I've tried running it as a administrator, trouble shooting / changing the compatibility to windows XP service pack 2 & 3, still didn't work.

@TITLE:JPopupMenu not showing on the screen?
@CONTENT:So for my school project I am creating a Class Diagram maker. I am 95% done with it and all I need is to make the Jpopup menu appear. In the core I have 3 files. The ApplicationModel which extends the JFrame, ClassDiagram which extends the JPanel and ClassModel which makes the Rectangles (in the picture) appear. The core of the rendering is on Rectangle objects and the text inside the middle and bottom rectangles are surrounded by another invisible rectangle, which is right-clickable. This is what the program looks like (Minus the paint editting) Now for the file that handles the clicking is DiagramMouseListener, here is the code for it. package edu.mville.cs.classdiagram;

}
 At line 118 where it says System.out.println("it is"); It successfully displays the text on console, which tells me the code successfully reached that part, but the popup menu is never displayed when I right click the text (which is inside invisible Rectangles separated by 5 pixels of space). I tried multiple solutions to this problem. I even looked at the oracle tutorials and other user's examples to see what was wrong with my code. But after countless hours of searching, I failed to fix the problem. Any help would be appreciated. Also if you need more information, I will be glad to provide! Thanks.

Like site1.com will be setup obviously to return let's say if site2 wanted a string of 5 digits, site1 will generate the string and simply return it in the page (site1.com/gen?leng=5 could work, but its the matter of getting it displayed on the site..)

@TITLE:How do you ensure an update has finished in meteor before running a find?
@CONTENT:I have a fairly typical need, to ensure an insert / update has finished before I run a find. The code goes something like this: //Update my collections
Messages.insert({author:_id,text:text});
Authors.update({_id:_id},{$inc:{messages:1}});

//Wait until the update / insert has finished

//Perform some actions on the collections just updated
var author = Authors.findOne({task:taskId},{sort:{'messages':1}});
//Do some more complex stuff...
 While in most cases this would be fine as asynchronous calls, with the dom updating as and when things complete, in my case it is essential that the insert and update have completed before I run the function call. Do I need to perform the insert and update as a server side call with a callback function, or is there some way I could do this on the client side? At the moment I have something like: Meteor.call("recordMessage", _id, text, 
    function(err, out){postMessage(_id)}
);
 which works - but I'd like to know if I could do this on the client side.

}

function storeFormDataFailure(result){

}
 What happens is that when I used decoded json data in server php file in the insert statements, nothing happens. I tried echoed values of email, gender, etc. but nothing prints as if they contain no values. However, if I sent the decoded json values of email, gender etc. in the returnData array as they are used in insert statements, values successfully received by the app which made the request, i.e: shown those values in the alert in the js code. Please solve this problem?

@TITLE:how to call a stored procedure using table data?
@CONTENT:i want to create a stored procedure by using below requirement. i tried and written a stored procedure it is working fine with the static values. how a stored procedure will work with the dynamic values. Please find my requirement here.  Create a stored proc ¡§skillsparse¡¨ that accepts a string of text and and breaks it up into 1,2,3 word phrases. 

    a.       For example: I love java because it¡¦s fun should have these 15 phrases

    i.      I
   ii.      I love
   iii.      I love java
   iv.      Love
   v.      Love java
   vi.      Love java because
   vii.      Java
   viii.      Java because
   ix.      Java because it¡¦s
   x.      Because
   xi.      Because it¡¦s
   xii.      Because it¡¦s fun
   xiii.      It¡¦s
   xiv.      It¡¦s fun
   xv.      fun

    3.       Store these phrases in a new table called: github_skills_phrases with fields:  ID, userid, skills_id (from github_skills_source) and skills_phrase

    4.       Create a storedproc that compares the skills_phrases against the skills table (ref Table) and store the values into the github_skills table for each user. If possible, please maintain the source of where the skills came from (repodesc, repolang, starred, bio)

    5.       NOTE: Aside from the info in the new table Kishore is creating, you will also need to run the github_users.bio field against the Skillsparse procedure.  You can start this first (for testing logic, etc) since the github_users.bio already exists and has data.



    We don¡¦t need to go this for users who have not yet been processed for skills

 When i land on this page everything works fine. Shall I use something like this? That I took from this website, can I use JSON to accede to my ftp folder and than cycle the content? Should I put this in a function? If yes who is going to call it? $("#Photos").live("pagebeforeshow", function(){

@TITLE:How to convert a degrees calculation to radians? (Kawa to Java)
@CONTENT:I have tried to convert a calculation from an app I made using MIT AppInventor which uses Kawa to Android using Java.The problem I'm facing is that the trigonometric parts of the calculation in Kawa are using degress.My question is how do I translate this calculation to Java and get the same output? This is how I do the calculation is Kawa,all variables are of type double:  Tri 1=atan(Offset Depth/Offset Length)
 Mark 1=sqrt(Offset Length^2+Offset Depth^2)
 Tri 2=(180-Tri1)/2
 Mark 2=Duct Depth/(tan(Tri 2))
 Then I did my best to translate it to Java code,the variables are double also as above,depth,length and duct depth are user input values.  tri1 = Math.atan(offsetDepth / offsetLength);
 marking1 = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(offsetLength,2) + Math.pow(offsetDepth,2));  
 tri2 = (180 - tri1) / 2;
 marking2 = ductDepth / Math.tan(tri2);
 Screenshot of what the inputs and outputs look like:
@CODE:Tri 1=atan(Offset Depth/Offset Length)
 Mark 1=sqrt(Offset Length^2+Offset Depth^2)
 Tri 2=(180-Tri1)/2
 Mark 2=Duct Depth/(tan(Tri 2)) tri1 = Math.atan(offsetDepth / offsetLength);
 marking1 = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(offsetLength,2) + Math.pow(offsetDepth,2));  
 tri2 = (180 - tri1) / 2;
 marking2 = ductDepth / Math.tan(tri2);

@TITLE:Simple_form input as both text and autocomplete
@CONTENT:I am using gem 'simple_form', '2.0' and gem 'rails3-jquery-autocomplete', '1.0.10'. I am unable to make a string field accept two ':as' arguments. <%= f.input :product_description , :url => autocomplete_product_name_products_path,
:as => :text, :as => :autocomplete, :placeholder=>"Type product name",
:input_html => {:class =>"span2", :rows => 6}, wrapper: :inline_label, label:false  %>
 If I remove :as => :text, the auto-complete part works but ':rows => 6' part fail. And if I keep both, I get 6 rows but the auto-complete stops working. I need this field to have have multiple rows as well as auto-complete. This is a really silly question but I am stuck. Please help.

@LINK:/questions/20592989/modify-tld-of-url-of-current-tab-in-a-browser-action
@TITLE:Modify TLD of URL of current tab in a browser action
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a browser action that will insert some text between ".com" (or whatever TLD is there) and the "/foo.bar" parts of a URL. For example, if I'm on "stackoverflow.com/questions" I want to be able to press a button in my browser and automatically be redirected to "stackoverflow.com.my.text/questions" The button shows up in the right place (and looks pretty) but does nothing. I modeled my code after this example. This is what I currently have: manifest.json     {
  "manifest_version": 2,

   "name": "My Extension",
   "version": "1.0",

   "background": { "scripts": [ "insert.js" ] },
   "browser_action": { "default_icon": "my_icon.png" },
   "permissions": [ "tabs", "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ]

}
 and insert.js chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {

    var url = tab.url; 
    var tld = /\.\w+\//;
    var url2 = tld.exec(url);

    var break = url.indexOf(url2);
    var break1 = break + url2[0].length - 1;

    var url1 = url.substring(0, break1);
    var url3 = url.substring(break1, url.length);

    var mytext = ".my.text";
    var urlNew = url1 + mytext + url3;

    chrome.tabs.update(tab.id, {url: urlNew});
});
 I'm probably missing something really obvious, but I know basically nothing about JavaScript. I did test the script itself by modifying the code at http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_regexp_test2 so I know it matchs the right regular expression and spits out the right string. I searched around for a while and couldn't find anything to guide me. Why does the example I posted work, but my code does not?
@CODE:{
  "manifest_version": 2,

   "name": "My Extension",
   "version": "1.0",

   "background": { "scripts": [ "insert.js" ] },
   "browser_action": { "default_icon": "my_icon.png" },
   "permissions": [ "tabs", "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ]

} chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {

    var url = tab.url; 
    var tld = /\.\w+\//;
    var url2 = tld.exec(url);

    var break = url.indexOf(url2);
    var break1 = break + url2[0].length - 1;

    var url1 = url.substring(0, break1);
    var url3 = url.substring(break1, url.length);

    var mytext = ".my.text";
    var urlNew = url1 + mytext + url3;

    chrome.tabs.update(tab.id, {url: urlNew});

When I try to create a tile using montage -compress lzw -tile 2x1 -geometry +0+0 Figure4L.tiff Figure4R.tiff Figure4.tiff
 I get a file 12800x6400 TIFF which has a size of 12.8 MB, GIMP reports a resolution of 72 x 72 ppi. GIMP also reports "Warning:The image you are loading has 16 bits per channel. GIMP can only handle 8 bit, so it will be converted for you. Information will be lost because of this conversion." which was not present in the initial images What and why is being lost with the montage? Is the montaging lossless? Apparently not. Is there a better way to achieve my purpose without losing quality? UPDATE: This might be related to how R writes TIFFs so I updated the tags. It might be also related to TIFF plot generation and compression: R vs GIMP file sizes

@TITLE:google maps - best way to show all saved locations on map (saved in my db or directly on maps server?)
@CONTENT:I have a page where latitude, longitude can be saved by clicking on the map. Currently storing those values in my db. I want to build a webpage where I want to show all saved places. One answer I know is: retrive all records from db, and mark them on map. This way also helps in filtering based on some fields in db. By the way, how to show radially, I mean, instead of loading all places at once, I think its good to do ajax requests to my db for places(lat, longitudes) available in that radial region showed by map, when we move the map, then we search in our db for places in that radial range and show only those places. this way, we need not load all(may be a million) saved places at a time. But how to do this? How can I fetch all records in my db whose lat, longitutes present in that radial range? Another way: While saving in db itself, also save on map somehow so when that map is shown it will simply show that map which automatically shows saved places(saved in google maps server somehow). Is this possible? even if possible, I think I cant filter(easily) based on fields in this way as they are shown directly by map. But, if possible to do, it can be used to show simply when not filtering.

@TITLE:Unexpected behaviour in a game example from a book
@CONTENT:I just got the book Head First C# 3rd Edition. In the first part of the book it gets you started creating a simple game where you make bouncing circles that you must avoid while clicking and dragging a "human" to safety. The coding involves C# as well as XAML for the graphics side. Everything works except for one thing. Instead of clicking and dragging the "human" if I click on it it will "follow" the cursor around and the game behaves as if the cursor itself is the human since that is where game over happens when I hit one of the bouncing circles. I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. I have looked over the code line by line next to the book.....The only thing I can figure out is that this block of code. private void playArea_PointerMoved(object sender, PointerRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (humanCaptured)
    {
        Point pointerPosition = e.GetCurrentPoint(null).Position;
        Point relativePosition = grid.TransformToVisual(playArea).TransformPoint(pointerPosition);
        if ((Math.Abs(relativePosition.X - Canvas.GetLeft(human)) > human.ActualWidth * 20)
            || (Math.Abs(relativePosition.Y - Canvas.GetTop(human)) > human.ActualHeight * 20))
        {
            humanCaptured = false;
            human.IsHitTestVisible = true;
        }
        else
        {
            Canvas.SetLeft(human, relativePosition.X - human.ActualWidth / 2);
            Canvas.SetTop(human, relativePosition.Y - human.ActualHeight / 2);
        }

 The book says to put the human actual width and height to 3. But if I do that and try to click on the person in the actual game it won't even register the cursor at all. but if I put that at 20 or above and I click on the human as I said earlier it starts following my cursor around and the rest of the game behaves normally. Here is the code that is supposed to make the cursor be able to "click" and "drag" the human. private void human_PointerPressed(object sender, PointerRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (enemyTimer.IsEnabled)
    {
        humanCaptured = true;
        human.IsHitTestVisible = false;
    }
}
 And here is the related XAML code this is supposed to be working with to make it click and drag but instead is making it follow my cursor around the area: <StackPanel x:Name="human" Orientation="Vertical" Canvas.Left="17" Canvas.Top="15" 
                    PointerPressed="human_PointerPressed" >
            <Ellipse Fill="White" Height="10" Stroke="White" Width="10"/>
            <Rectangle  Fill="White" Height="25" Stroke="White" Width="10"  />
        </StackPanel>
 Everything else seems to be working right. I have checked the code in the book over and over and gone to their site. Nothing I did is different as far as I can tell. If anyone can help it will be greatly appreciated.
@CODE:private void playArea_PointerMoved(object sender, PointerRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (humanCaptured)
    {
        Point pointerPosition = e.GetCurrentPoint(null).Position;
        Point relativePosition = grid.TransformToVisual(playArea).TransformPoint(pointerPosition);
        if ((Math.Abs(relativePosition.X - Canvas.GetLeft(human)) > human.ActualWidth * 20)
            || (Math.Abs(relativePosition.Y - Canvas.GetTop(human)) > human.ActualHeight * 20))
        {
            humanCaptured = false;
            human.IsHitTestVisible = true;
        }
        else
        {
            Canvas.SetLeft(human, relativePosition.X - human.ActualWidth / 2);
            Canvas.SetTop(human, relativePosition.Y - human.ActualHeight / 2);
        }
    }

@CONTENT:The other day I asked a question related to this, and I got an answer, but it did not do what I wanted. Here is the method I have for traversing a multidimensional associative array, checking whether a key is in the array (from the answer to my previous question): private function checkKeyIsInArray($dataItemName, $array)
{
    foreach ($array as $key => $value)

    [0] => Array ( [reset_time] => 2013-12-11 22:24:25 )
    [1] => Array ( [email] => someone@example.com )
)
 The method traverses the first array branch, but not the second. Could someone explain why this might be the case please? It seems I am missing something.

Now the issue I am facing is that Google Tasks .Net libraries and Google Drive/Calendar .Net libraries do not work together. Visual Studio would not compile (error: these libraries are linked to different versions of Google.apis.dll). I tried finding Tasks API libraries V2, but it does not exist. Then I tried finding libraries for Drive or Calendar V1, but couldn't find them either. This is forcing me to use GData libraries (and API) for Calendar, Contacts and Drive. The problem is GData API is deprecated and will go away in 2015. I must be missing something here because I can't imagine Google guys could bungle up this big.

The output I would ideally like to have is L11a.csv, L22b.csv, etc. I think I need to concatenate each row observation's Site, Location, and Block into another column and then use that column as the filename for the write.table function? I searched SO and this question is similar except in the reverse direction: When importing CSV into R how to generate column with name of the CSV? Many thanks for your assistance. This would save me hours in renaming files!

@TITLE:Compare attribute of one element to attribute of another element
@CONTENT:This seems like it should be easy, but I can never figure it out. Presume I have the following document: <data>
    <a>
       <b val="1"/>
    </a>
    <c val="1">
</data>
 And assume that I am executing an XPath from the context of <b>. I need to check if there is an element c that has the same value as b. Obviously, this doesn't work: ../a/c[@val=@val]
 How to I get an XPath to remember its "current" context when traversing the tree?
@CODE:<data>
    <a>
       <b val="1"/>
    </a>
    <c val="1">
</data> <b> c b ../a/c[@val=@val]

 Similar error for the other member functions that employed key and next. This program works very well now. However, after I moved the 2 lines in node class, int key; node *next; under protected, then it gives me error such as "node::key is protected". First, please don't blame me for doing something stupid :P . I know if I struct for the node then life will be much easier. I am trying to practice inheritance and to understand protected. That's why. By definition, protected members can be accessed by derived class, right? I don't know where I am doing it wrong. Hope you can help me out. Thanks!

@TITLE:Saving the managedObjectContext for a specific object
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn Core Data, and am having trouble updating the MOC after adding new objects to an existing object. I can create the original object, a training day, and I can add exercise objects to that training day, but I can't figure out how to save the context so that later in my application I can find all exercises in a training day. Any ideas?? Here is my code: // Data from JSON
NSArray *trainingDayData = responseData[@"training_days"];
for (NSDictionary *aTrainingDay in trainingDayData) {

    // Find the specific training day and save the MOC, creating the trainingDayObject
    NSNumber *idTrainingDay = [NSNumber numberWithInt:[[aTrainingDay objectForKey:kID_KEY] intValue]];
    VitTrainingDay *trainingDayObject = [VitTrainingDay trainingDayCreateOrObjectWithID:idTrainingDay];

     // Configure the VitTrainingDay object's fields
     trainingDayObject.name = aTrainingDay[@"name"];
     trainingDayObject.order = aTrainingDay[@"order"];              

}
// assign exercises to each trainingDayObject(this is inside a larger for loop)
trainingDayObject.userExercise = [NSSet setWithArray:userExerciseObjects];

// Below are attempt one and two to update the MOC after assigning exercises to the trainingDayObject.

// This works to save the updated MOC, but also adds two blank trainingDayObjects, since it 'insertNewObjectForEntityName', which I don't want. 
trainingDayObject = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"TrainingDay" inManagedObjectContext:self.context];

//This as far as I can tell is doing nothing. It just points to the conventional MOC save method. I pull it out below.
[self.coreDataManager saveContextForManagedObjectContext:self.context];
 Here is the saveContextForManagedObjectContext method I call above: - (void)saveContextForManagedObjectContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)moc
{

    if (![moc save:&error]) {

@TITLE:Keeping selected an option in select dropdown with jquery after refresh
@CONTENT:I have small script that reloads a select containing the nicknames of the users in a chatroom. When someone clicks the select, the javascript refreshes it, repopulating the option from a php page to add people that have logged in and removing those who logged out. The script works properly on reloading the select, but I want it to avoid losing the precedent selected option if a user clicks the select another time to refresh the list, and the script doesn't keep the correct option. All the code works properly, except that part of the jquery. The JS (the jquery library is of course also on the page): <script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#Users").focusin(function() {
      var UsersSelect = $('#Users').val();
      $("#Users").load("users.php");
      $('select[name="Users"]').val(UsersSelect);
    });
  });
</script>

<select name="Users" id="Users">
<?
$queryprep = "select name FROM users";
$query = $PDO->prepare($queryprep);

    boolean checked = (mCheckBox==null)?false:(((CheckBox)  mCheckBox).isChecked());
    // if convert view is null then create a new instance else reuse it
    if (view == null) {
        view = new ImageView(Context);
        Log.d("GridViewAdapter", "new imageView added");
    }
    if(checked == true){
        isSdReadable();

            FileInputStream in = Context.openFileInput("BitmapImage");
            // Load back the image file to confirm it works
            Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(in);
            view.setImageBitmap(bitmap);

    return view;
}
 How can I make it so that I can send intent to my other class so I can get the bitmap? ADDED: Does this work the same way? (Please check my coding) Intent intent = new Intent (v.getContext(), GVABackup.class);
                       v.getContext().startActivity(intent);
                       Log.i("AppInfoAdapter", "New intent started to send icon bitmap");
 for one class and then @Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    // Try to reuse the views
    ImageView view = (ImageView) convertView;
    boolean checked = (mCheckBox==null)?false:(((CheckBox)  mCheckBox).isChecked());
    // if convert view is null then create a new instance else reuse it
    if (view == null) {
        view = new ImageView(Context);
        Log.d("GridViewAdapter", "new imageView added");
    }
    if(checked == true){
        isSdReadable();
        Intent intent = new Intent (view.getContext(), GVABackup.class);
           view.getContext().startActivity(intent);
    } else {
        Log.e("GridView", "Icons not for use/checkbox not checked");
    }
    view.setImageResource(drawables.get(position));
    view.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
    view.setLayoutParams(new android.widget.GridView.LayoutParams(70, 70));
    view.setTag(String.valueOf(position));
    return view;
}
 in my adapter with the GVABackup class like this: package com.example.awesomefilebuilderwidget;

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: General suggestions for debugging in R 11 answers If you have a block of R code, a combination of commands and functions, and you want to debug the code, line by line, and kinda go through the internal process R is doing behind the scene before it spits out an error message, what commands could one employ? trace() and debug() seem to be just for functions. I am trying to run my entire script and find out, line item by line item, what R is doing internally along each commend line.

@TITLE:How to compare nodes in minHeapify for minimum spanning tree?
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a minimum spanning tree using prim's algorithm and I have a major question about the actual heap. I structured my graphs adjacency list to be a vector of vertexes, and each vertex has a vector of edges. The edges contain a weight, a connecting vertex, and a key. I am not sure whether my heap should be a heap of vertexes or edges. If I make it a heap of vertexes then there is no way to determine whether the weights are going from the same parent and destination vertexes, which makes me think that I should be making a heap for each vertexes list of edges. So my final question is should I be creating a heap of edges, or a heap of vertexes? If its a list of edges, should I be using the weight on the edges as the key, or should I have a separate data member called key that I can actually use for the priority queue? Thanks!

@TITLE:Counting conditional formatting cells by colorIndex
@CONTENT:I have some people, whose working time are shown by the conditional formatting in the cells on their own columns - e.g. B7:B36, C7:C36, D7:D36 and so. I try to count the conditional formatting cells to the column E. The end result in the cell is #Value (Arvo), but when you press F9, then the numbers can be displayed. When I run the code step by step, I noticed that after the line "Range("B6", ws.Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell)).ClearFormats program jump to function "Function CountRed(MyRange As Range" and stay in the Loop for some time. Is this because that there is a function "CountRed(B6)+CountGreen(C6)+CountBlue(D6)" for example in the cell E6? In addition, I would like the column numbers in column E are concentrated in the central.

@TITLE:How to use the mysql connection on multiple classes?
@CONTENT:I have some issues with the conection between java application and mysql. This is my file(this file work very well): import java.sql.*;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class MysqlConnect{

public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {

    Connection conn = null;
    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/";

        System.out.println("Connected to the database");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }


}
}
 Is possible "to separate" the main and mysql connection ?? My idea is something like that :I have the MysqlConnection file and another GUI file. In the GUi file I have a button (ADD) and whenever I click this button some datas will be stored to database .My problem is that I don't know how run the query ,because I need the Statement variable ,Connection variable,etc..What I suppose to do ?To do the mysqlConnection and GUI in the same file ?Another idea of mine is to do an object of type MysqlConnection and work with that object.And here is the problem :If I remove the (public void main .....) i have an error at try and catch. Sorry if my english is bad but I hope i make myself clear . Thanks in advance .

@TITLE:How to cut data in even pieces in R? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Split a vector into chunks in R 12 answers Here is the problem: I have a dataset, let's say: a <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1)
 I want to cut it into even pieces (e.g. 5 pieces ). The problem is I cannot use quantiles or cut because some values repeat, so you cannot set distinct breakpoints. > quantile(a)
  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
   0    0    1    1    1 
 (repeated breakpoints) > cut(a, 5)
 [1] (-0.001,0.199] (-0.001,0.199] (-0.001,0.199] (-0.001,0.199] (0.801,1]     
 [6] (0.801,1]      (0.801,1]      (0.801,1]      (0.801,1]      (0.801,1]     
Levels: (-0.001,0.199] (0.199,0.4] (0.4,0.6] (0.6,0.801] (0.801,1]
 (only two levels used) I know I can produce a vector like this: b <- c(1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5)
 and use it for sampling. Or I can use for loop and count instances. But this needs loops and some clumsy coding. I am looking for a simple and efficient (R-style) function that does better than this. (I can write it but I don't want to reinvent the wheel.)

@TITLE:Multiple ¡§close¡¨ buttons on modal
@CONTENT:I am using the modals found here on Codrops. These modals have one close button (also closes when you click outside the modal), but I want to add more. The JavaScript is below: var ModalEffects = (function() {

    function init() {

        var overlay = document.querySelector( '.md-overlay' );

        [].slice.call( document.querySelectorAll( '.md-trigger' ) ).forEach( function( el, i ) {

            var modal = document.querySelector( '#' + el.getAttribute( 'data-modal' ) ),
                close = modal.querySelector( '.md-close' );

            function removeModal( hasPerspective ) {
                classie.remove( modal, 'md-show' );

                if( hasPerspective ) {
                    classie.remove( document.documentElement, 'md-perspective' );
                }
            }

            function removeModalHandler() {
                removeModal( classie.has( el, 'md-setperspective' ) ); 
            }

            el.addEventListener( 'click', function( ev ) {
                classie.add( modal, 'md-show' );
                overlay.removeEventListener( 'click', removeModalHandler );
                overlay.addEventListener( 'click', removeModalHandler );

                if( classie.has( el, 'md-setperspective' ) ) {
                    setTimeout( function() {
                        classie.add( document.documentElement, 'md-perspective' );
                    }, 25 );
                }
            });

            close.addEventListener( 'click', function( ev ) {

                removeModalHandler();
            });

        } );

    }

    init();

})();
 I thought by just simply swapping: close = modal.querySelector( '.md-close' );
 With this: close = modal.querySelectorAll( '.md-close' );
 would do the trick -- and every element with the md-close class would close the modal. I was wrong (I'm new to JavaScript if you couldn't tell). Thanks in advance for any help with this! Updated Code: var ModalEffects = (function() {

    function init() {

@TITLE:jQuery, issue with .animate() and .fadeIn()
@CONTENT:Inside a div .frame I have 3 others div: .top, .middle and .bottom. .top and .bottom are in display none, and when the mouse is over .frame, with the jquery function animate, the height of .frame is increasing and .top and .bottom are showing with .fadeIn(). When the mouse is out .frame, the size of .frame is decreasing and .top and .bottom are going away with .fadeOut(). My CSS are: .frame{
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 1px;
    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    position: absolute;
    top:50px;
    left:50px;
}

.middle{

}

.bottom{
    position:absolute;
    display:none;
    bottom:0px;
    background-color:red;
    width:100%;
}
 my HTML: <div class="frame">
    <div class="top">top</div>
    <div class="middle">middle</div>
    <div class="bottom">bottom<br>bottom<br>bottom<br>bottom</div>

 and my jQuery: var t,
    h;
    $(document).on('mouseenter mouseleave', '.frame', function( e ) {
        var el = $(this),
            top = el.children('.top'),

            middle = el.children('.middle'),
            mEnt = e.type == "mouseenter";

        if(t == null){
            t = el.offset().top;
            h = el.height();
        }

        if(mEnt == true){
            middle.stop().animate({'top':'20px'});
            el.stop().animate({
                'height':h+bottom.height()+20,
                'top':t-20
            }); 
            top.stop().fadeIn(300);
            bottom.stop().fadeIn(300);
        }else{
            middle.stop().animate({'top':'0px'});
            el.stop().animate({

    });
 you can see the effect in the jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/malamine_kebe/WE25E/ My issue (you can't see it in the jsFiddle but in my computer it does it) is when i'm entering and leaving .frame really fast and that my mouse is finaly over .frame then .top and .bottom doesn't want to fadeIn and all I can see is a blank

@TITLE:in ember how to create a class method on Ember.Object.extend that can work to access a json service
@CONTENT:Sorry to ask such a simple question but I'm looking at migrating from jQuery to Ember and am trying to figure out calling / responding json without using ember-data. One question I have is how do people suggest having class methods. Say for example I have a post object like this: Hex.Post = Ember.Object.extend({
  id: null,
  body: null
});
 Would a reasonable findById look like this? $(document).ready(function(){
  Hex.Post.findById=function(id){
    console.log("you are here");
    $.getJSON("/arc/v1/api/post/" + id, function(data){
         var post = Hex.Post.create();
         post.set('id', data.id);
         post.set('body',data.body);
        return post;
    });
  };
});
 Or is this just wrong for creating a findById class method? When I run this from the chrome console, it comes back as undefined even though the JSON call works fine in a brower. What am I doing wrong? thx FROM CHROME CONSOLE:
@CODE:Hex.Post = Ember.Object.extend({
  id: null,
  body: null
}); $(document).ready(function(){
  Hex.Post.findById=function(id){
    console.log("you are here");
    $.getJSON("/arc/v1/api/post/" + id, function(data){
         var post = Hex.Post.create();

@CONTENT:Background: I am deploying a django application with Python 2.7.5 && Django 1.6. Currently I am able to render all pages, but one. The only error I am able to see when tailing the logs is: "GET /woc/ HTTP/1.1" 500 2011 "http://myPrivateApp.rhcloud.com/myPrivatePage/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0" Obviously this log message doesn't tell me much other than it failed and I cannot find any django related logs within the repos. After playing around with the other pages, I highly suspect the issue is related to an exception being thrown within the page. Question: How can I debug Django exception errors on OpenShift? Is it possible to step through executing code in Openshift via ssh && the use of a debugger app such as ipdb? I would really like to dig deeper into the issue, but am not finding any clear way to do so with OpenShift.

Instead of showing every month as debt I would need to show only a year as debt. For example: I would need to check if there were any payments in the year, if there are none then I need to show that year in my table. In my previous output I had something like this: Member's code  |  Debt ( Months )

@LINK:/questions/20585753/p-waitfor-does-not-wait-for-process-to-complete-java
@TITLE:p.waitFor() does not wait for process to complete (Java)
@CONTENT:This is a spinoff of this thread: Killing a JFrame/Java when process finishes I know this question has been asked various times here on SO but none of the answers seem to solve my problem. The issue I am having is this: I have a java program that calls a batch file. I need the batch file to finish before the Java program continues. For this I use the waitFor() method, which should wait until the process finishes. However, it doesn't. I found this thread, which suggests that the process waitFor() is actually waiting for is simply cmd.exe, which returns before the actual process does. Runtime.exec().waitFor() doesn't wait until process is done That thread recommends using the /wait command, but when I do it makes no difference. My code is very in-depth with several classes that all rely on one another, but here is an attempted SSCCE: public class BatchFileRun(){
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        list.add("cmd.exe");
        list.add("/C");
        list.add("Start");
        list.add("/wait");
        list.add(("C:\\.....\\scripts\\myBatchFile.bat"));
        list.add("batchVariable");
        String[] commands = new String[list.size()];
        commands = list.toArray(commands);
        Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(commands);
        p.waitFor();
        closeWindow();
    }
    void closeWindow(){
        WindowEvent close = new WindowEvent(this, WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING);
        Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemEventQueue().postEvent(close);
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
 The batch file simply operates on the variable passed into it as a parameter (batchVariable). All prior commands should be used to simply run the batch file. The problem is that the closeWindow() method is called before the process in the batch file is finished. Therefore, the Java process that appears in the Windows task manager remains running, even though it should close when closeWindow() is called (if I am using it correctly). I really need said process to close when the process running from the batch file is complete. I have tried different ways of running the batch file (using ProcessBuilder, for example), but no matter what I try I have the same problem.
@CODE:public class BatchFileRun(){
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        list.add("cmd.exe");
        list.add("/C");
        list.add("Start");
        list.add("/wait");
        list.add(("C:\\.....\\scripts\\myBatchFile.bat"));
        list.add("batchVariable");

@TITLE:Angular removing / from strings within Directive - seems to butcher html
@CONTENT:I'm having an issue (just learning Angular) with a string having any / removed and replaced with ="". I have a directive that takes it's element and then wraps it with a div and provides some styling to the div - namely a background-url - it is the URL that is being replaced with something else. It may be a little odd - what I am actually trying to do here - and that's ok; i'm just trying to learn a little more about Angular and simple manipulation of elements seems a good place to tinker.. Here is what I have: HTML - notice the set-background attribute on the image. <div id="home">
        <img src="~/Content/Images/Site/home-background.jpg" set-background />
</div>
 Angular directive dwApp.directive('setBackground', function () {

    return {
        restrict: 'A',
        scope: {},
        link: function (scope, element, attrs) {

            element.addClass('backgroundCover');
            var bgImg = 'style="background-image:url("' + attrs.src + '");'

            element.remove();

        }        
    }
});
 Resulting HTML - notice the background-url <div id="home">
        <div class="backgroundCoverContainer" style="background-image:url(" content="" images="" site="" home-background.jpg");=""></div>
</div>
 If I console.log(bgImg) I get: style="background-image:url("/Content/Images/Site/home-background.jpg"); 
 Clearly, the background-image isn't actually being rendered like that though... any ideas?

git push origin HEAD:refs/for/82-changes-and-fixes-to-files-view
 (crunch, crunch) ! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/for/82-changes-and-fixes-to-files-view (branch 82-changes-and-fixes-to-files-view not found)
 Branch not found? Hm... Something came to my mind, that docs said something about manually creating a branch, via Gerrit UI, before pushing changes. Am I right? Anyway, I'm doing so. I'm creating a branch, through UI, giving it above name (82-changes-and-fixes-to-files-view) and corresponding revision, taken from git status (2b25fe7612f1563a78c9dc2d1574ae3dcfe9d5a1).

 (crunch, cruch) ! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/for/82-changes-and-fixes-to-files-view (no new changes)

@CONTENT:I am interested in replacing all words in a tm Corpus object according to a dictionary made of a two columns data frame, where the first column is the word to be matched and the second column is the replacement word. I am stuck with the translate function. I saw this answer but I can't transform it in a function to be passed to tm_map. Please consider the following MWE library(tm)

docs <- c("first text", "second text")
corp <- Corpus(VectorSource(docs))

dictionary <- data.frame(word = c('first', 'second', 'text'),
                      translation = c('primo', 'secondo', 'testo'))

translate <- function(text, dictionary) {
  # Would like to replace each word of text with corresponding word in dictionary
}

corp_translated <- tm_map (corp, translate)

inspect(corp_translated)

@CONTENT:I am developing an application which generates pdf using ITextSharp and need to print silently or directly. My work flow is Like this, I have some forms listed in tree structure and on selecting the forms and click on the print button will automatically generate the pdf using Itextsharp and save to a location. this is because for multiple record we download it as zip file . And goes to print without opening any other windows. I am using google chrome as browser and uses the KIOSK mode. But unfortunately when i execute the code the print preview will open up in my browser and i need to click on the back button to reach my page. I want this to be cleared. Also i need to clear the selection of the tree structure. Hereby attaching the code while printing. MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
var urlPdf = Server.MapPath("~/Pdf/pdfMerge/" + id + "Merge_doc.pdf");
PdfReader ps = new PdfReader(urlPdf);//1
PdfStamper pdf = new PdfStamper(ps, ms);//2

@TITLE:How can identify Applet subclasses from a Jar file?
@CONTENT:I have the two following class hierarchy in jar files where the only difference is that Main in example2.jar has no package while Main in example1.jar is part of the package user. example1.jar // user/Main.java
package user;
import Engine.GameWindow;
public class Main extends GameWindow { }

// Engine/GameWindow.java
package Engine;
import java.applet.Applet;
public abstract class GameWindow extends Applet { }
 example2.jar // Main.java
import Engine.GameWindow;
public class Main extends GameWindow { }

// Engine/GameWindow.java
package Engine;
import java.applet.Applet;
public abstract class GameWindow extends Applet { }
 I created this program to determine which classes inside of a jar file are subclasses of Applet. import java.applet.Applet;
public class JarClassIdentifier 
{
  public static void main(String[] args) 
    throws Exception 
  {
    // example1.jar: args = { "user.Main.class", "Engine.GameWindow.class" }
    // example2.jar: args = { "Main.class", "Engine.GameWindow.class" }

      if(Applet.class.isAssignableFrom(c))
        System.out.println(class_name);
    }
  }
}   
 For example1.jar, the program correctly prints user.Main and Engine.GameWindow. Why does example2.jar only print out Engine.GameWindow?

@TITLE:AngularJS nginx configuration for PHP api
@CONTENT:I am in the process of switching my apache to an nginx server, and everything appears to have gone smoothly, aside from the configuration for my api. My old configuration under apache relied on an .htacess file in the root directory to redirect all requests to the angular entry point (in this case index.php) as follows: DirectoryIndex index.php
Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine on

# - See more at: http://newmediascientist.com/posts/redirecting-into-angularjs-for-friendly-urls/#sthash.5Oln1Wzh.dpuf
 My api is located under the http://localhost.local/api directory, has a index.php file which acts as the controller, so Angular makes its REST calls to http://localhost.local/api/index.php/{{ctrl}}/{{id}}?q={{other params}} I cannot seem to get this same configuration to work under nginx, any request is automatically redirected to the /index.php file (the Angular entry point) and not to the api entry point. Now I am not dead set on using localhost.local/api/index.php?{{ctrl}}... in fact I would prefer a cleaner localhost.local/api/{{ctrl}} etc... I was just unable to achieve that on my previous server. My current non-working nginx configuration is as follows: server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/htdocs;
    index index.php;
    server_name localhost.local;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/temperatures.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/temperatures.error.log debug;
    add_header "X-UA-Compatible" "IE=Edge,chrome=1";
    location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
    }
    location /api {
            index /api/index.php;
            try_files /api/index.php/$uri?$args;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/php5-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
    }
    location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all;
    }
}
 Any help would be greatly appreciated on this! Edit Also tried the following which gives the correct url to the server, however it doesn't pass it to php. location ~ /api/ {
    rewrite ^/api(/.*)$ /api/index.php$1 break;
    }
 Edit 2 Modifying the code to this: location ~ /api/ {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /api/index.php$is_args$args;
            location ~ ^/api/index.php(.*)$ {
                    fastcgi_index index.php;
                    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
                    fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/php5-fpm.sock;
                    include fastcgi_params;
            }
    }
 yields the best results, as I can get the server to respond properly to a normal request (api/{{collection}}/{{id}} however if I add in a GET param it breaks the entire process as there is no longer a seperation between the request_uri and the get params as there was with Apache's PATH_INFO.

 But, as long as I tryied to change the targetDocId, when it's use as argument to importTheses(targetDocId, thesesId, thesesType); it still has the value 'No doc ID informed yet', even I have changed it, as if the program had been run from the beginning. Is an alternative to this "reset to original value" behavior? Or I have to use scriptDB or ScriptProperties to store the changed value of the global variable?
@CODE:var targetDocId = 'No doc ID informed yet'; function generatePersonDatasheet() {
  var target = createDuplicateDocument(template, docName);
  var link = target.getUrl();
  targetDocId = target.getId(); // <-------- HERE
  if (theses == 1){
    Logger.log("going to showList() ");
    return showList();
  }   
  showURL(docName, link); 
} function submit(e){
  var numberOfItems = Number(e.parameter.checkbox_total);
  var thesesArrays = [];
  for(var i = 0; i < numberOfItems; i++){
    if(e.parameter['checkbox_isChecked_'+i] == 'true'){
      thesesArrays.push(fact_list[i]);
    }
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < thesesArrays.length; i++){
    var thesesId = thesesArrays[i][2];
    var thesesType = thesesArrays[i][1];        
    importTheses(targetDocId, thesesId, thesesType); // <-----HERE
  }
  return UiApp.getActiveApplication().close();
}

function importTheses(targetDocId, thesesId, thesesType) {
  var targetDoc = DocumentApp.openById(targetDocId);
  var targetDocParagraphs = targetDoc.getParagraphs();
  var targetDocElements = targetDocParagraphs.getNumChildren();

  var thesesDoc = DocumentApp.openById(thesesId);
  var thesesParagraphs = thesesDoc.getParagraphs();
  var thesesElements = thesesDoc.getNumChildren();

  var eltargetDoc=[];

Graph = Struct.new(:vertexes, :edges)

[48] pry(main)> t_graph[:vertexes] = Array.new(Vertex.new())
TypeError: can't convert Vertex into Integer

 On the other hand, this works: [49] pry(main)> t_graph[:vertexes] = [Vertex.new(), Vertex.new()]
=> [#<struct Vertex parent=nil, rank=nil>,
 #<struct Vertex parent=nil, rank=nil>]

@TITLE:How to update select options before showing them in Jquery?
@CONTENT:Look at this example code: <html>
<head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      $(document).ready(function(){
        $("body").on('click', "#teste",function(){
          $('#teste').append('<option id="pera">pera</option>')
          $('#teste').show();
        });

    </script>

<body>
    <select id="teste">
        <option value="banana">banana</option>
        <option value="laranja">laranja</option>
    </select>

</body>
 My problem here is that the click event show the select box and only after it updates it with the new value ("pera"). What I need to do is first update the select with the new value and only after show it. Is there anyway to do that using jQuery? Thanks in advance, guys! EDIT: Ok, let me try to explain a little bit clear: Whenever you click in a select to show the options it show it automatically (it's obvious!). My problem is that I need to intercept the click event, update the select and only after it show the select. But it's showing the select (it's the default behaviour) before updating. Here is what happening: 1) Select with initial values: banana, laranja 2) User click it. What I want: Show banana, laranja and pera as options. What happens: It shows banana, laranja in the list, show it and only after update the select (If I inspect the html code with fiebug, the pera option is there!). If I click again inthe select, the pera options appears normally and as the code above says, it appends another pera option in the select that only appears in the next click and so on.
@CODE:<html>

@TITLE:p:selectBooleanButton doesn't render preselected value
@CONTENT:I been reading / trying examples for hours, and I can't make it work. I'm using Primefaces 4.0 I just need a way to select/unselect and assign those values to a Map The xhtml looks like this. <p:selectBooleanButton value="#{presupuestoBean.itemsCambiar[itemPresupuesto.id]}"
onLabel="Yes" offLabel="No" onIcon="ui-icon-check" offIcon="ui-icon-close">
     <p:ajax listener="#{presupuestoBean.updateItemPresupuestoAsignado(itemPresupuesto.id,0)}"/>
</p:selectBooleanButton>
 Init Method (reset to False just in case, and then assign the true values)  for (ItemPresupuesto itemsPresupuestoDefault : itemsPresupuestoDefaults) {
        itemsCambiar.put(itemsPresupuestoDefault.getId(),Boolean.FALSE);
    }
 assign TRUE values if (itemPresupuestoAsignado.isCambiar()) {
            itemsCambiar.put(itemPresupuestoAsignado.getId(), Boolean.TRUE);

        }
 and public Map<Long, Boolean> getItemsCambiar() {
        return itemsCambiar;
    }
 My expected behavior is when the itemsCambiar has some item 'TRUE', the onIcon should be displayed. But it's not happening, all p:selectBooleanButton are displaying as offIcon. I notice a couple of things while debugging. The Boolean value assigned at Init, is properly assigned. If I change the selectBooleanButton for an outputLabel, is showing 'true' (which is correct) When I change the selectBooleanButton, and the event is fired, I can see that the 'true' value in the HashMap is not a java.lang.Boolean but a java.lang.String (attachment) So maybe, this problem is related a cast problem, but I'm putting Boolean.TRUE in the map, so ... any ideas?
@CODE:<p:selectBooleanButton value="#{presupuestoBean.itemsCambiar[itemPresupuesto.id]}"
onLabel="Yes" offLabel="No" onIcon="ui-icon-check" offIcon="ui-icon-close">
     <p:ajax listener="#{presupuestoBean.updateItemPresupuestoAsignado(itemPresupuesto.id,0)}"/>
</p:selectBooleanButton> for (ItemPresupuesto itemsPresupuestoDefault : itemsPresupuestoDefaults) {
        itemsCambiar.put(itemsPresupuestoDefault.getId(),Boolean.FALSE);
    } if (itemPresupuestoAsignado.isCambiar()) {
            itemsCambiar.put(itemPresupuestoAsignado.getId(), Boolean.TRUE);

@TITLE:Graph or Relational DB specifically recursion
@CONTENT:I am about to develop a solution for a customer where the basic entity is a member and members can have different multiple social relationships with other members. For instance Lets say we have four types of members Doctors, Specialist, Nurses and Patients. So one or more Doctors can consult one or more Specialists, One or more Doctors can treat one or more Patients. One or more Doctor is in Charge of one or more Nurses. So if I were to use a Relational DB a high degree of recursion would be necessary (as All entities must be members). Whereas recursion is not necessary in a Graph data model. Is it then safe to say it is better to use a Graph database for a social type application where members may have different or overlapping roles.

@TITLE:CUDA Dynamic Parallelizm; stream synchronization from device
@CONTENT:I am basically looking for a way to synchronize a stream from within the device. I want to avoid using cudaDeviceSynchronize(), as it would serialize execution of my kernel that I want to execute concurrently using streams; More detailed description: I have written a kernel, that is a stabilized bi-conjugate gradient solver. I want to lunch this kernel concurrently on different data using streams. This kernel uses cublas functions. They are called from within the kernel. One of operations required by the solver is calculation of a dot product of two vectors. This can be done with cublasdot(). But as this call is synchronous, execution of kernels in different streams get serialized. Instead of calling a dot product function, I calculate the dot product using cublasspmv(), which is called asynchronously. The problem is that this function returns before the result is calculated. I want therefore to synchronize the stream from the device - I am looking for an equivalent of cudaStreamSynchronize() but callable from the device. __device__ float _cDdot(cublasHandle_t & cublasHandle, const int n, real_t * x, real_t * y) {
      float *norm; norm = new float; 
      float alpha = 1.0f; float beta = 0.0f;

      cublasSgemv_v2(cublasHandle, CUBLAS_OP_N ,1 , n, &alpha, x, 1, y, 1, &beta, norm, 1);

      return *norm;
}
 What can I do to make sure, that the result is calculated before the function returns? Of course insertion of cudaDeviceSynchronize() works, but as I mentioned, it serializes the execution of my kernel across streams. Thanks, Marcin

@TITLE:itextsharp not closing files
@CONTENT:I've got some code for itextsharp merging 2 pdf files. Found it online somewhere. The merging works fine, but it seems that the source files are staying in use after it is all done. What I'd like to do is to delete the first file that i have already merged, which is uploaded via a fileupload, and keep only the merged file. It's definitely the code doing the merging that is causing the file to stay open. I tried to delete the file on the server and it tells me something like it's open by the IIShelper. Through hours of work I narrowed to down to this stuff. Why is it keeping the file in use?     public static void MergeFiles(string destinationFile, string[] sourceFiles)
    {

        int f = 0;
        // we create a reader for a certain document

        int n = reader.NumberOfPages;
        // step 1: creation of a document-object
        Document document = new Document(reader.GetPageSizeWithRotation(1));
        // step 2: we create a writer that listens to the document
        PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, new FileStream(destinationFile, FileMode.Create));
        // step 3: we open the document
        document.Open();
        PdfContentByte cb = writer.DirectContent;

        if(reader.IsEncrypted() == false)
        {
            // step 4: we add content

@LINK:/questions/20574699/gwt-how-to-download-entrypoint-after-authenticating
@TITLE:GWT: How to download EntryPoint after authenticating?
@CONTENT:The idea here is to have my GWT app in 2 different modules: WebModule (entry point) that simply contains a login screen; and AppModule (entry point) that contains the main application When users go to the website, the WebModule downloads into their browser and presents a login screen to them. They must then submit a username and password, which then uses GWT-RPC to authenticate them and determine if they are allowed to proceed. If authentication passes, I would like the AppModule to be downloaded, which has its own starting Place (and respective view/presenter), and I would like the user to be redirected to that place. How could I implement this functionality? Both: Forcing the AppModule to download only upon successful login; and Redirecting the user to the AppModule's starting place? Thanks in advance!

I do not have access to those cms and the way they function. So my widget needs to be adaptable to any website and easy to include by the websites administrators via a simple line of code. It also needs to use clear urls to navigate. like www.websiteURL/countryA/regionB/cityC/ So I guess it would need to "override" the websites cms navigation systems. Is that possible, and if yes what are the possibilities and the best ways to include a small, adaptable and independant php widget into several CMS beasts while still keeping clean URLS to navigate within the widget itself?

@TITLE:Plot function with large binomial coefficients
@CONTENT:I would like to plot a function which involves binomial coefficients. The code I have is #!/usr/bin/python
from __future__ import division
from scipy.special import binom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

max = 500
ycoords = [sum([binom(n,w)*sum([binom(w,k)*(binom(w,k)/2**w)**(4*n/math.log(n)) for k in xrange(w+1)]) for w in xrange(1,n+1)]) for n in xrange(2,max)]

xcoords = range(2,max)

plt.plot(xcoords, ycoords)
plt.show()
 Unfortunately this never terminates. If you reduce max to 40 say it works fine. Is there some way to plot this function? I am also worried that scipy.special.binom might not be giving accurate answers as it works in floating point it seems.

@TITLE:How to recursively map entity to view model with Automapper function call?
@CONTENT:Spin off of my earlier question -> How to map .NET function call to property automatically? I have some related entity objects that I want to map to view models, and each mapping to a view model needs to call a function for the mapping. The tricky part is that the entity function returns another entity which needs to be mapped to it's view model. The flow is somewhat like this. CartEntity > CartViewModel > CartEntity.GetCartItems() > CartViewModel.CartItems > CartEntity.GetCartItems().GetItem() > CartViewModel.CartItems.Item > CartEntity.GetCartItems().GetItem().GetProduct() > CartViewModel.CartItems.Item.Product Here are the classes, where I am trying to recursively build a nested set that is populated with each object. Entities: public class CartEntity {
    public long Id {get; set;}
    public List<CartItem> GetCartItems() {
          return Repository.GetAll<CartItem>();
    }
}

public class CartItem {

    public long ItemId {get ; set;}
    public Item GetItem() {
          return Repository.Get<Item>(ItemId);
    }
}

public class Item {

    public long ProductId {get; set;}
    public Item GetProduct() {

@LINK:/questions/20573547/wrong-autoincrement-value-in-sqlite-using-jpa
@TITLE:Wrong autoincrement value in sqlite using JPA
@CONTENT:I'm working on a simple project using sqlite, JPA and eclipseLink. First I create my Person table in my database with this: CREATE TABLE Person ( 
idPerson  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
firstname      TEXT  DEFAULT 'NULL',
birthdate DATETIME        DEFAULT 'NULL'
)
 and then add a new test entry (in order to generate the sqlite_sequence table) INSERT INTO [Person] ([firstname], [birthdate]) VALUES ('Foo', '1145-11-12 00:00:00')
 All the successive insertion are done using JPA, where in the Person class I use this notation for the person id: @GeneratedValue(generator="sqlite_person")
@TableGenerator(name="sqlite_person", table="sqlite_sequence",
    pkColumnName="name", valueColumnName="seq",
    pkColumnValue="Person")
@Column(name="idPerson")
private int id;
 The first JPA insertion is ok (that is, new new inserted person has id = 2) but then I get an increment of 50 instead of only 1 (so the third inserted person has id = 52, the fourth 102 and so on). I read that "making modifications to this table will likely perturb the AUTOINCREMENT key generation algorithm" [ref] Is my problem related to this, even if in theory I'm not modifying that table? Any kind of suggestion in order to resolve the problem?

 The first time I executed this code it executed the line EventLog.CreateEventSource(source, log);
 and continued to step through, thereafter it skips this line and executes the remaining lines to completion, each time. Looking good! The indication is that it has created my log and is putting events in it. However I can't see my log in the Win7 Event Viewer.

@TITLE:navigationController property is declared in UINavigationController.h but is a property of UIViewController
@CONTENT:I am new to Ios development and I am following the Big nerd book to learn it. I have a confusion over the "navigationController". for instance in my class that is an instance of UITableViewController (same for any subclass of UIViewController as well) I have this : [[self navigationController]
     pushViewController:detailViewController
     animated:YES];
 when I look at apple documentation this navigationController seems to be a property of UIViewController, but is said that it is declared in UINavigationController.h ! I opened the UIviewcontroler.h and there is no property or method for navigationController, but as the documentation says it is indeed in UINavigationController.h it does not make sense at all . first of all I know that a child class inherits the property and methods of the parent class, but UITableViewControler is by no mean a subclass of UINavigationController ,but a child of UiViewController . So hopefully some one understand what I am asking. How I am able to access to this property when I am not inheriting from UINavigationController ? and how the documentation can show that as a property of UiViewController ?

 I'm not able to log in using the Active Directory Usernames and Passwords. However, I'm not able to deny access to certain parts of the website to specific groups. This way searches the entire active directory and if you are part of it, you're able to log in. In one application, I would insert users into an SQL table, then grant users access to the website and so on if they were part of the sql table. This works well, however, the application is growing rapidly with many users and I would like to take advantage of the groups within Active Directory. I have spent the past few days researching and experimenting but I'm not finding any solutions. Many have used Windows Authentication, but it is less visually appealing and at this stage, would probably just freak out the end-users for a few weeks. (The application spreads across 13 different stores) I have also looked into this article... and have tried this solution in a test application but didn't have any luck. Keep getting an error saying "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" in the custom ADRoleProvider. var root = new DirectoryEntry(WebConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConnectionStringName].ConnectionString, ConnectionUsername, ConnectionPassword);
 I'm just wondering if anyone knows of a way to do this properly or a different way to do this. Any suggestion is helpful! Thanks!

@TITLE:Methods on descriptors
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a wrapper around a redis database that does some bookkeeping, and I thought about using descriptors. I have an object with a bunch of fields: frames, failures, etc., and I need to be able to get, set, and increment the field as needed. I've tried to implement an Int-Like descriptor: class IntType(object):
    def __get__(self,instance,owner):
        # issue a GET database command
        return db.get(my_val)

    def __set__(self,instance,val):
        # issue a SET database command
        db.set(instance.name,val)

    def increment(self,instance,count):
        # issue an INCRBY database command
        db.hincrby(instance.name,count)

class Stream:
    _prefix = 'stream'
    frames = IntType()
    failures = IntType()
    uuid = StringType()

s = Stream()

s.frames.increment(1)  # float' object has no attribute 'increment'
 Is seems like I can't access the increment() method in my descriptor. I can't have increment be defined in the object that the __get__ returns. This would require an additional db query if all I want to do is increment! I also don't want increment() on the Stream class, as later on when I want to have additional fields like strings or sets in Stream, then I'd need to type check the heck out of everything.
@CODE:class IntType(object):
    def __get__(self,instance,owner):
        # issue a GET database command
        return db.get(my_val)

    def __set__(self,instance,val):
        # issue a SET database command
        db.set(instance.name,val)

    def increment(self,instance,count):
        # issue an INCRBY database command
        db.hincrby(instance.name,count)

class Stream:
    _prefix = 'stream'
    frames = IntType()
    failures = IntType()
    uuid = StringType()

s = Stream()

s.frames.increment(1)  # float' object has no attribute 'increment'

@TITLE:Pointer to array of unknown bound? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Why is function(char * array[]) a valid function definition but not (char (*array)[] in C? 4 answers The following function declaration is accepted by gcc, but not accepted by g++. void do_something(char (*)[]);
 The error given by g++ is: error: parameter '<anonymous>' includes pointer to array of unknown bound 'char []'
 I believe that in C, the parameter is converted to char** which is why gcc accepts it fine. Can I make g++ accept this function somehow? See example: http://ideone.com/yqvqdB :) Thanks!

@CONTENT:I have an auto scaling group of instances in Amazon cloud and I want to monitor some metrics across all instances in auto-scaling group. For example it would be nice to have a metric which reports the maximum memory usage across all instances that belong to the group. Thus I would have an opportunity to detect memleaks. I know that I can monitor a group via load balancer's metrics, but I don't have one and don't want to. Group metrics described on this page http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/enable-metrics-collection.html are also not suitable.

@TITLE:Facebook returning random string instead of ¡§state¡¨ param
@CONTENT:I am using Omniauth for Facebook connect in a Rails app. Facebook auth connects properly, but the "state" param - through which I should be able to pass data to retrieve on callback - is returning a string I can't decipher. For example, authorizing through "/auth/facebook?display=popup&state=19422" ends up returning a state of "ecae4f444fb248944083db0623c9a86f3f75dff36006be7e" Any idea why this is happening?

@CONTENT:I have spent several hours trying to search this on the web in addition to calling and emailing support at 1and1.com web hosting with no success. I have ASP.NET pages which connect to MS SQL Server database using the entity framework. On my local machine, all works fine (naturally). However, when I modify the connection string in my web.config to point to my SQL Server database on 1and1.com, I get the following error: "Unable to load the specified metadata resource." Here's my current connection string (as defined in my web.config file):     <add name="TimeDataLicenseEntities"

@TITLE:How can I fail a test in TestNG in an AfterMethod?
@CONTENT:I want to check some external log files after each test, if there were ary errors during execution. Throwing an exception in an AfterMethod doesn't work, because it is handled differently by TestNG: it will just fail the configuration method and not the preceding test. My approach would be like this: @AfterMethod(alwaysRun = true)
protected void tearDown(ITestResult result) {
    if (thereWasAProblemDuringTestExecution()) {
        result.setStatus(ITestResult.FAILURE);
        result.setThrowable(getSomeThrowableSomebodyStoredAnywhere());
    }

    // doing other cleanUp-tasks
}
 But still, my Eclipse TestNG plugin says the test passed. Is it possible (and how) to fail a test (and not only a configuration method) in a configuration method?
@CODE:AfterMethod @AfterMethod(alwaysRun = true)

@TITLE:Determine if hasMany -> belongsTo item has been created in Ember.js
@CONTENT:I'm using Ember: 1.3.0-beta.2 and Ember Data: 1.0.0-beta.2 Here's my setup: Models Rise.User = DS.Model.extend({
  //....
  user_training_plans: DS.hasMany('training_plan', { async: true }),
  user_training_histories: DS.hasMany('training_history', { async: true }),
});

Rise.TrainingHistory = DS.Model.extend({
  //....
  user: DS.belongsTo('user', { async: true }),
  training_resource: DS.belongsTo('training_resource', { async: true })
});

Rise.TrainingPlan = DS.Model.extend({
  //....
  user: DS.belongsTo('user', { async: true }),
  training_resource: DS.belongsTo('training_resource', { async: true })
});
 In a controller action, I'm trying to "move" a training resource from a user's training plan to training histories. I'd like to determine if the training resource has already been added to training histories before adding it. I'd like to do something like this, which is currently in the training plans route markCompleted: function(trainingPlanItem) {
  completed_training_resource_id = trainingPlanItem.get('training_resource.id');

  this.controller.get('user_training_histories').then( function(user_training_histories) {
    var already_exists = user_training_histories.any( function(item) {
      var item_id = item.get('training_resource').get('id');
      if (item_id == completed_training_resource_id) {
        return true;
      }
    });

    // ...continues
  });
}
 Of course, item.get('training_resource').get('id'); returns a promise if the data has not been fetched, so this if (item_id == completed_training_resource_id) comparison line doesn't work correctly. Is there a way to run any and use a promise inside? Or is there a way to see the training_resource_id without loading the training resource? This is a belongs_to relationship, so the training resource id is fetched from the server.
@CODE:Rise.User = DS.Model.extend({
  //....
  user_training_plans: DS.hasMany('training_plan', { async: true }),
  user_training_histories: DS.hasMany('training_history', { async: true }),
});

Rise.TrainingHistory = DS.Model.extend({
  //....
  user: DS.belongsTo('user', { async: true }),
  training_resource: DS.belongsTo('training_resource', { async: true })
});

Rise.TrainingPlan = DS.Model.extend({
  //....

@LINK:/questions/20569217/custom-knockoutjs-bindinghandler-for-dynamic-bootstrap-tooltips
@TITLE:Custom KnockoutJS bindingHandler for dynamic Bootstrap Tooltips
@CONTENT:I've found a couple other questions and resources here on using Bootstrap tooltips with a custom knockout binding handler. However, I haven't found is a cohesive solution that 1) involves using a dynamic knockout template 2) one where the tooltip can change when data it is bound to changes. I'm also away of knockout-bootstrap on GitHub, but the tooltip title in that is rendered only once, I've created a NEW JSFiddle with the following new dynamicTooltip that's based on the prior JSFiddle. The new DynamicTooltip data binder looks like: ko.renderTemplateHtml = function (templateId, data) {
    var node = $("<div />")[0];
    ko.renderTemplate(templateId, data, {}, node);
    return $(node).html();
};

ko.bindingHandlers.tooltip = {
    init: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel, bindingContext) {
    var local = ko.utils.unwrapObservable(valueAccessor()),
        options = {};

    ko.utils.extend(options, ko.bindingHandlers.tooltip.options);
    ko.utils.extend(options, local);

    var tmplId = options.kotemplate;

    ko.utils.extend(options, {
        title: ko.renderTemplateHtml(tmplId, viewModel)
    });

    $(element).tooltip(options);

    ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallback(element, function () {
        $(element).tooltip("destroy");
    });
},
update: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel, bindingContext) {
    var local = ko.utils.unwrapObservable(valueAccessor()),
        options = {};

    ko.utils.extend(options, ko.bindingHandlers.tooltip.options);
    ko.utils.extend(options, local);

    var tmplId = options.kotemplate;
    var forceRefresh = options.forceRefresh;
    var newdata =  ko.renderTemplateHtml(tmplId, viewModel); 
    $(element).data('bs.tooltip').options.title = newdata

},
options: {
    placement: "top",
    trigger: "hover",
    html: true
}};
 It's not complete, as I'm manually triggering the update call manually by passing in a dummy databinding property on the view Model, in this case, it's called renderTooltip(): <a data-bind="tooltip: { title: firstName, placement: 'bottom', kotemplate: 'tile-tooltip-template', forceRefresh: renderTooltip() }">Hover on me</a>
 I'd like to be able to trigger the tooltip to refresh itself when data changes. I'm thinking I should be using createChildContext() and maybe controlsDescendantBindings, but I'm not really sure. Any thoughts? I'll continue to update this, because it seems like dynamic bootstrap tooltips would be a common idea.
@CODE:ko.renderTemplateHtml = function (templateId, data) {
    var node = $("<div />")[0];
    ko.renderTemplate(templateId, data, {}, node);
    return $(node).html();
};

ko.bindingHandlers.tooltip = {
    init: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel, bindingContext) {
    var local = ko.utils.unwrapObservable(valueAccessor()),
        options = {};

    ko.utils.extend(options, ko.bindingHandlers.tooltip.options);
    ko.utils.extend(options, local);

    var tmplId = options.kotemplate;

    ko.utils.extend(options, {
        title: ko.renderTemplateHtml(tmplId, viewModel)
    });

    $(element).tooltip(options);

    ko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallback(element, function () {
        $(element).tooltip("destroy");
    });
},
update: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel, bindingContext) {
    var local = ko.utils.unwrapObservable(valueAccessor()),
        options = {};

    ko.utils.extend(options, ko.bindingHandlers.tooltip.options);
    ko.utils.extend(options, local);

    var tmplId = options.kotemplate;
    var forceRefresh = options.forceRefresh;
    var newdata =  ko.renderTemplateHtml(tmplId, viewModel); 
    $(element).data('bs.tooltip').options.title = newdata

},
options: {
    placement: "top",
    trigger: "hover",
    html: true
}}; <a data-bind="tooltip: { title: firstName, placement: 'bottom', kotemplate: 'tile-tooltip-template', forceRefresh: renderTooltip() }">Hover on me</a>

@TITLE:Rails - how do I change .new/.save to .create
@CONTENT:I have two models: Schedule and Project. Project has_one Schedule and Schedule belongs_to Project. When I create a schedule, I do: def create
    @schedule = Schedule.new(schedule_params)
    @schedule.project  = Project.find(params[:project_id])
    if @schedule.save
        flash[:notice] = "Successfully created schedule."
    redirect_to profile_path(current_user)
    end
end
 This works. However, I added an after_create callback and an after_update callback to make notifications. A 'new schedule created' notification when the schedule is created, and a 'your schedule has been updated' notification when it is updated. The problem is that in the controller I use @schedule.new and @schedule.save, not @schedule.create. I need to change my controller code to use .create so the after_create callback will work. I have already tried using the after_save callback, but that gets called whenever the schedule is updated as well so that won't work. Because of the way I define @schedule and @schedule,project, I cannot figure out how to change the code I have above to use @schedule.create. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks.
@CODE:def create
    @schedule = Schedule.new(schedule_params)

@TITLE:C++ - Developing own version of std::count_if
@CONTENT:For a task, I'm doing some simple data sampling to determine which samples contains audio counting the total number of energy. I've been looking into the std::count_if function, and, although this suits my needs to a certain extent, for example: int foo = std::count_if(
               std::begin(samples), 
               std::end(samples),
               containsSound);
 This counts the total number of samples that contain sound, but does not give an indication to the samples that contain sound. I came up with this solution: std::vector<std::string> sound_files = myLib::count_sample_if(
                                              std::begin(samples),
                                              std::end(samples),
                                              samples.DirName, 
                                              containsSOund);
 This would then store and push the samples.DirName to a vector which I can then use to only store the sample set of my choice. My question is whether or not this would be easy to implement?
@CODE:std::count_if int foo = std::count_if(
               std::begin(samples), 
               std::end(samples),
               containsSound); std::vector<std::string> sound_files = myLib::count_sample_if(

 Where I will finally update the textView. But somehow it never updates, although my toast test function works and my logs all show the correct values the textView will NOT update. Can anybody please tell me what I am doing wrong or what I am missing?

@TITLE:Deployment of jar file and including outside libraries
@CONTENT:For the past several weeks I've been working with Java and I know that this question may be dumb... I created a console application which is using the MySQL Connector to update records in a database, the problem is that when I deploy it to a jar file and run it I get that the MySQL Connector is missing. I used JDeveloper for this deployment and from the jar export settings I marked that this library needs to be exported too. I am not sure what could be the issue and any input will be welcomed. Thank you in advance.

I am trying to download an Excel file from our ASP.NET website after getting the filestream from a WCF service. This seems to work okay, but I may be going the entirely wrong way about it.
