@TITLE:How do you add a general label to facets in ggplot2?
@CONTENT:I often have numeric values for faceting. I wish to provide sufficient information to interpret these faceting values in a supplemental title, similar to the axis titles. The labeller options repeat much unnecessary text and are unusable for longer variable titles. Any suggestions? The default: test<-data.frame(x=1:20, y=21:40, facet.a=rep(c(1,2),10), facet.b=rep(c(1,2), each=20))
qplot(data=test, x=x, y=y, facets=facet.b~facet.a)
 What I would love: The best I can do in ggplot: qplot(data=test, x=x, y=y)+facet_grid(facet.b~facet.a, labeller=label_both)
 As indicated by @Hendy, similar to: add a secondary y axis to ggplot2 plots - make it perfect
@CODE:test<-data.frame(x=1:20, y=21:40, facet.a=rep(c(1,2),10), facet.b=rep(c(1,2), each=20))

@TITLE:Cassandra Client Java API's [closed]
@CONTENT:I have recently started working with Cassandra Database. Now I am in the process of evaluating which Cassandra client we should go forward with. I have seen various post on stackoverflow about which client to use for Cassandra but none has very definitive answer. My team has asked me to do some research on this and come up with certain pros and cons for each Cassandra Client API¡¦s in Java. As I mentioned, I recently got involved with Cassandra so not have that much idea why certain people choose Pelops client and why certain people go with Astyanax and some other clients. I know brief things about each of the Cassandra clients, by which I mean I am able to make that work and start reading and writing to Cassandra database. Below is the information I have so far. CASSANDRA APIS Hector (Production-Ready) The most stable of the Java APIs, ready for prime-time. Astyanax (The Up and Comer) A clean Java API from Netflix. It isn't as widely used as Hector, but it is solid. Kundera (The NoSQL ORM) JPA compliant, this is handy when you want to interact with Cassandra via objects. This constrains you somewhat in that you won't be able to have a dynamic number of columns/names, etc. But it does allow you to port over ORMs, or centralize storage onto Cassandra for more traditional uses. Pelops I've only used Pelops briefly. It was a straight forward API, but didn't seem to have the momentum behind it. PlayORM (ORM without the constraints?) I just heard about this. It looks like it is trying to solve the impedance mismatch between traditional JPA-based ORMs and NoSQL by introducing JQL. It looks promising. Thrift (Avoid Me!) This is the "low-level" API. Below are our priorities in deciding Cassandra Client- First priorities are: low latency overhead, Asynch API, and reliability/stability for production environment. (e.g. a more user-friendly APIs that can be had in the DAL that wraps the client). Connection pooling and partition awareness are some other good feature to have. Able to detect any new nodes that got added. Good Support as well (as pointed by dean below) Can anyone provide some thoughts on this? And also any pros and cons for each Cassandra Client and also which client can fulfill my requirements will be of great help as well. I believe, mainly I will be revolving around Astyanax client or New Datastax client that uses Binary protocol I guess basis on my research so far. But don't have certain information to back my research and present it to my team. Any comparison between Astyanax client and New Datastax client(which uses new Binary protocol) will be of great help. It will be of great help to me in my research and will get lot of knowledge on this from different people who have used different clients in the past.

@CONTENT:this is driving me nuts. I believe I asked this exact same question but I can't find it anymore(I used stackoverflow search, google search, manually searched my posts, searched my code). I wanted something that would be like the C# String.Format where you could do something like string format = String.Format("Hi {0}",name); just for javascript of course and one person gave me a simple answer it was not like a jquery plugin or anything but I think you made some json thing or something and it worked and was simple to use. I for the life of me can't find this post. I do have this in my code but I can't seem to find anything that uses it and I am pretty sure I used it a couple times. String.prototype.format = function(o)
{
    return this.replace(/{([^{}]*)}/g,
       function(a, b)
       {
           var r = o[b];

 Well, I thought this would stop the browser to download and even inquire the server about the images for 1 year. But it's partially true: cause if you close and reopen the browser, the browser does NOT download the images from server anymore, but browser still inquires the server with an HTTP request for each image. How do I force browser to stop making HTTP requests for each image? Even if these HTTP requests are not followed by an image being downloaded, they are still requests made to the server that unecessarely icrease latency and slow down the page rendering! I already told the browser it MUST keep the images in cache for 1 year! Why does browser still inquire the server for each image (even if it does not download the image)?! Looking at network graphs in FireBug (menu FireBug > Net > Images) I can see different caching behaviours (I obviously started with the browser cache completly empty, I forced a cache delete on browser using "Clear All History"): When the page is loaded for the 1st time all images are downloaded (and same thing happens if I force a page reload by clicking on the browser's reload page button). This makes sense! When I navigate the site and get back to the same page the images are not downloaded at all and the browser does NOT even inquire the server for any of the images. This makes sense, (and I would like to see this behaviour also when browser is closed)! When I close the browser and open it again on the same page, the silly browser makes anyway HTTP request to the server one time per image: it does NOT downalod the image, but it still makes an HTTP request, it's like the browser inquires the server about the image (server replies with 200 OK). This is the one that irritates me! I also attach the graphs below if you are interested: EDIT: just tested now also with FireFox 11.0 just to make sure it wasn't an issue of my FireFox 3.6 being too old. The same thing happens!!! I also tested Google site and Stackoverflow site, they do both send the Cache-Control: max-age=... but the browser still makes an HTTP request to the server for each image once the browser is closed and opened again on the same page, after server response the browser does NOT download the image (as I explained above) but it still makes the damn request that increases time to see page. EDIT2: and removing the Last-Modified header as suggested here, does not solve the problem, it does not make any difference.

@TITLE:Android SDK Setup under Windows 7 Pro 64 bit
@CONTENT:The short version of my issue at hand, Windows 7 Professional x64 Java JDK 1.6.0_17 x64 Eclipse Galileo w\ADT Plugin installed Android SDKtools r04 Since the Android SDK download now only includes the tools, you have to run the included SDK Manager application (SDK Setup) through which you can download the platforms, additional tools, docs,etc. Under my current configuration SDK Setup bombs on launch, so, I can't do anything since I do not have a single platform to start writing against...I've read a few places that the fix is "just install the 32 bit JDK and all will be well" that seems surprising and disappointing option for a work around(downloading it now to try). My question is this, anyone else run into this same issue and how did you get past it? Is there a place I can "download by hand" the components I need that I missed on the Android SDK site? Odds are pretty good that the 32 bit "fix" will work, but that seems wrong that I'll have to install a secondary version of the same SDK/JRE just to run this tool and to download the actual Android SDK components Thanks! UPDATE: Well, the work around that requires you to also install 32 bit java and referencing that as your JAVA_HOME worked, either by calling the SDK setup manually or through eclipse. I'm not particularly happy with that, so I'll leave this one open for the time being in case there are other ways to get this done that people may know about. UPDATE 2: Not directly related since it is Linux centric, but there are troubleshooting steps if trying to run the SDK/Eclipse under Linux 64bit where they reference the need to be able to run 32 bit, but nothing similar under windows x64 FINAL UPDATE (?) Taking the info Seth's answer gave me, and running the bat manually(once I knew what file SDK Setup was running) the answer for me was simply adding ANDROID_SWT path variable that pointed to a valid location with the x86_64 swt.jar....the android sdk directory had one, seemingly in the right place, but it couldn't find it until I added that to my path.

@TITLE:Client-side logic OR Server-side logic?
@CONTENT:I've done some web-based projects, and most of the difficulties I've met with (questions, confusions) could be figured out with help. But I still have an important question, even after asking some experienced developers: When functionality can be implemented with both server-side code and client-side scripting (JavaScript), which one should be preferred? A simple example: To render a dynamic html page, I can format the page in server-side code (PHP, python) and use Ajax to fetch the formatted page and render it directly (more logic on server-side, less on client-side). I can also use Ajax to fetch the data (not formatted, JSON) and use client-side scripting to format the page and render it with more processing (the server gets the data from a DB or other source, and returns it to the client with JSON or XML. More logic on client-side and less on server). So how can I decide which one is better? Which one offers better performance? Why? Which one is more user-friendly? With browsers' JS engines evolving, JS can be interpreted in less time, so should I prefer client-side scripting? On the other hand, with hardware evolving, server performance is growing and the cost of sever-side logic will decrease, so should I prefer server-side scripting? EDIT: With the answers, I want to give a brief summary. Pros of client-side logic: Better user experience (faster). Less network bandwidth (lower cost). Increased scalability (reduced server load). Pros of server-side logic: Security issues. Better availability and accessibility (mobile devices and old browsers). Better SEO. Easily expandable (can add more servers, but can't make the browser faster). It seems that we need to balance these two approaches when facing a specific scenario. But how? What's the best practice? I will use client-side logic except in the following conditions: Security critical. Special groups (JavaScript disabled, mobile devices, and others).

@TITLE:PBKDF2 with bouncycastle in Java
@CONTENT:I'm trying to securely store a password in a database and for that I chose to store its hash generated using the PBKDF2 function. I want to do this using the bouncy castle library but I don't know why I cannot get it to work by using the JCE interface... The problem is that generating the hash in 3 different modes: 1. using the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 secret key factory provided by sun 2. using the bouncy castle api directly 3. using the bouncy castle through JCE results in 2 distinct values: one common to the first two and one for the third. Here is my code:     //Mode 1

    SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
    KeySpec keyspec = new PBEKeySpec("password".toCharArray(), salt, 1000, 128);
    Key key = factory.generateSecret(keyspec);
    System.out.println(key.getClass().getName());
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(key.getEncoded()));

    //Mode 2

    PBEParametersGenerator generator = new PKCS5S2ParametersGenerator();
    generator.init(PBEParametersGenerator.PKCS5PasswordToUTF8Bytes(("password").toCharArray()), salt, 1000);
    KeyParameter params = (KeyParameter)generator.generateDerivedParameters(128);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(params.getKey()));

    //Mode 3

    SecretKeyFactory factorybc = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBEWITHHMACSHA1", "BC");
    KeySpec keyspecbc = new PBEKeySpec("password".toCharArray(), salt, 1000, 128);
    Key keybc = factorybc.generateSecret(keyspecbc);
    System.out.println(keybc.getClass().getName());
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(keybc.getEncoded()));
    System.out.println(keybc.getAlgorithm());
 I know that PBKDF2 is implemented using HMAC SHA1 so that is why i chose as algorithm in the last method the "PBEWITHHMACSHA1" which i took from the bouncy castle java docs. The output is the following: com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE_ae

@TITLE:What are C macros useful for?
@CONTENT:I have written a little bit of C, and I can read it well enough to get a general idea of what it is doing, but every time I have encountered a macro it has thrown me completely. I end up having to remember what the macro is and substitute it in my head as I read. The ones that I have encountered that were intuitive and easy to understand were always like little mini functions, so I always wondered why they werent just functions. I can understand the need to define different build types for debug or cross platform builds in the preprocessor but the ability to define arbitrary substitutions seems to be useful only to make an already difficult language even more difficult to understand. Why was such a complex preprocessor introduced for C? And does anyone have an example of using it that will make me understand why it still seems to be used for purposes other than simple if #debug style conditional compilations? Edit: Having read a number of answers I still just dont get it. The most common answer is to inline code. If the inline keyword doesnt do it then either it has a good reason to not do it, or the implementation needs fixing. I don't understand why a whole different mechanism is needed that means "really inline this code" (aside form the code being written before inline was around). I also dont understand the idea that was mentioned that "if its too silly to be put in a function". Surely any piece of code that takes an input and produces an output is best put in a function. I think I may not be getting it because I am not used to the micro optimisations of writing C, but the preprocessor just feels like a complex solution to a few simple problems.

@LINK:/questions/2676295/quartz-preventing-concurrent-instances-of-a-job-in-jobs-xml
@TITLE:quartz: preventing concurrent instances of a job in jobs.xml
@CONTENT:This should be really easy. I'm using Quartz running under Apache Tomcat 6.0.18, and I have a jobs.xml file which sets up my scheduled job that runs every minute. What I would like to do, is if the job is still running when the next trigger time rolls around, I don't want to start a new job, so I can let the old instance complete. Is there a way to specify this in jobs.xml (prevent concurrent instances)? If not, is there a way I can share access to an in-memory singleton within my application's Job implementation (is this through the JobExecutionContext?) so I can handle the concurrency myself? (and detect if a previous instance is running) update: After floundering around in the docs, here's a couple of approaches I am considering, but either don't know how to get them to work, or there are problems. Use StatefulJob. This prevents concurrent access... but I'm not sure what other side-effects would occur if I use it, also I want to avoid the following situation: Suppose trigger times would be every minute, i.e. trigger#0 = at time 0, trigger #1 = 60000msec, #2 = 120000, #3 = 180000, etc. and the trigger#0 at time 0 fires my job which takes 130000msec. With a plain Job, this would execute triggers #1 and #2 while job trigger #0 is still running. With a StatefulJob, this would execute triggers #1 and #2 in order, immediately after #0 finishes at 130000. I don't want that, I want #1 and #2 not to run and the next trigger that runs a job should take place at #3 (180000msec). So I still have to do something else with StatefulJob to get it to work the way I want, so I don't see much of an advantage to using it. Use a TriggerListener to return true from vetoJobExecution(). Although implementing the interface seems straightforward, I have to figure out how to setup one instance of a TriggerListener declaratively. Can't find the docs for the xml file. Use a static shared thread-safe object (e.g. a semaphore or whatever) owned by my class that implements Job. I don't like the idea of using singletons via the static keyword under Tomcat/Quartz, not sure if there are side effects. Also I really don't want them to be true singletons, just something that is associated with a particular job definition. Implement my own Trigger which extends SimpleTrigger and contains shared state that could run its own TriggerListener. Again, I don't know how to setup the XML file to use this trigger rather than the standard <trigger><simple>...</simple></trigger>.

@CONTENT:I have an app that currently uses NSURLConnection for the vast majority of its networking. I would like to move to NSURLSession because Apple tells me that is the way to go. My app just uses the synchronous version of NSURLConnection by way of the + (NSData *)sendSynchronousRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request returningResponse:(NSURLResponse **)response error:(NSError **)error class method. I do this within a NSBlockOperation running on an NSOperationQueue so I am not needlessly blocking the main queue. The big advantage to doing things this way is that I can make the operations dependent on one another. For example, I can have the task that is requesting data be dependent on the login task finishing. I have not seen any support for synchronous operations within NSURLSession. All I can find are articles deriding me for even thinking of using it synchronously and that I am a horrible person for blocking the threads. Fine. But I see no way to make NSURLSessionTasks dependent on each other. Is there a way to do that? Or is there a description of how I would do such a thing in a different way?

@LINK:/questions/19545889/app-restarts-rather-than-resumes
@TITLE:App restarts rather than resumes
@CONTENT:Hopefully someone can help me figure out, if not a solution, at least an explanation for a behaviour. The Problem: On some devices, pressing the launcher icon results in the current task being resumed, on others it results in the initial launch intent being fired (effectively restarting the app). Why does this happen? The Detail: When you press the "Launcher Icon" the app starts normally - That is, I assume, an Intent is launched with the name of your first Activity with the action android.intent.action.MAIN and the category android.intent.category.LAUNCHER. This can't always be the case however: On the majority of devices, if you press the launcher icon after the app is already running, the currently running Activity in that process is resumed (NOT the initial Activity). It resumes in the same way as if you had selected it from the "Recent Tasks" in the OS menu. This is the behaviour I want on all devices. However, on selected other devices different behaviour occurs: On the Motorola Xoom, when you press the launcher icon, the App will always start the initial launch Activity regardless of what is currently running. I assume that the launcher icons always start the "LAUNCHER" intent. On the Samsung Tab 2, when you press the launcher icon, if you have just installed the app, it will always launch the initial Activity (Same as the Xoom) - however, after you restart the device after the install, the launcher icon will instead resume the app. I assume that these devices add "installed apps" into a lookup table on device startup which allow the launcher icons to correctly resume running tasks? I've read many answer that sound similar to my problem but simply adding android:alwaysRetainTaskState="true" or using launchMode="singleTop" to the Activity are not the answer. Edit: After the most recent launch of this app, we find that this behaviour has begun to occur on all devices after the first restart. Which seems crazy to me but looking through the restart process, I can't actually find what's going wrong.

@LINK:/questions/1540777/performancecounters-on-net-4-0-windows-7
@TITLE:PerformanceCounters on .NET 4.0 & Windows 7
@CONTENT:I have a program that works fine on VS2008 and Vista, but I'm trying it on Windows 7 and VS2010 / .NET Framework 4.0 and it's not working. Ultimately the problem is that System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.GetCategories() (and other PerformanceCounterCategory methods) is not working. I'm getting a System.InvalidOperationException with the message "Cannot load Counter Name data because an invalid index '' was read from the registry." I can reproduce this with the very simple program shown below: class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        foreach (var pc in System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.GetCategories())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(pc.CategoryName);
        }
    }
}
 I did make sure I'm running the program as an admin. It doesn't matter if I run it with VS/Debugger attached or not. I don't have another machine with Windows 7 or VS2010 to test it on, so I'm not sure which is complicating things here (or both?). It is Windows 7 x64 and I've tried forcing the app to run in both x32 and x64 but get the same results.
@CODE:class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        foreach (var pc in System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.GetCategories())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(pc.CategoryName);
        }

@CONTENT:Does anyone have any good link to a website or a good tool to create regular expressions rather than break your head to create one. The tool should be able to create regular expressions by simply selecting some sort of pattern text. For e.g If I want a phone number to be validated, I should be able to enter (000)-(111)-(1111) or 000-000-0000 or 000-0000000 and the tool shold generate regular expression automatically..

@LINK:/questions/13377373/shim-twitter-bootstrap-for-requirejs
@TITLE:Shim Twitter Bootstrap for RequireJS
@CONTENT:The RequireJS docs say that to support older versions of IE, you need to configure enforceDefine: true. So if you want to support Internet Explorer, catch load errors, and have modular code either through direct define() calls or shim config, always set enforceDefine to be true. See the next section for an example. NOTE: If you do set enforceDefine: true, and you use data-main="" to load your main JS module, then that main JS module must call define() instead of require() to load the code it needs. The main JS module can still call require/requirejs to set config values, but for loading modules it should use define(). Since Twitter Bootstrap isn't an AMD module, I need to shim it for it to work. This is how I configure it; <script type="text/javascript">
    var require = {
        paths: {
            "bootstrap": "../bootstrap",
            "jquery": "../jquery-1.8.2"
        },
        shim: {
            "bootstrap": ["jquery"]
        },
        enforceDefine: true
    };
</script>
 Later when my module wants bootstrap as a dependency, I still end up with an error message; Error: No define call for bootstrap
 http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#nodefine If I've understood the docs correctly, enforceDefineshould ignore shims but it's not. What am I doing wrong here?
@CODE:enforceDefine: true <script type="text/javascript">
    var require = {
        paths: {
            "bootstrap": "../bootstrap",
            "jquery": "../jquery-1.8.2"
        },
        shim: {
            "bootstrap": ["jquery"]
        },

(as in the task has started, takes a while, and half way through it needs to be cancelled) I found this from the doc at Celery FAQ >>> result = add.apply_async(args=[2, 2], countdown=120)
>>> result.revoke()
 But I am unclear if this will cancel queued tasks or if it will kill a running process on a worker. Thanks for any light you can shed!

@CONTENT:Im trying to do a dialog box with jquery. In this dialog box Im going to have terms and conditions. The problem is that the dialog box is only displayed for the FIRST TIME. This is the code. JavaScript: function showTOC()
{
    $("#TOC").dialog({ 
        modal: true, 
        overlay: { 
            opacity: 0.7,

    })
}
 HTML (a href): <a class="TOClink" href="javascript:showTOC();">View Terms & Conditions</a>

<div id="example" title="Terms & Conditions">1..2..</div>
 The problem I think is that when you close the dialog box the DIV is destroyed from the html code therfore it can never be displayed again on screen. Can you please help! Thanks
@CODE:function showTOC()

@CONTENT:I have a SQL 2005 database with approx 250 tables. I want to temporarily enable ON DELETE CASCADE to all of the Foreign Keys so that I can do a bulk delete easily. I then want to turn off ON DELETE CASCADE on all Foreign Keys. The only way I know of doing this, is to use Management Studio to generate a full database create script, do some kind of search and replace to strip out everything but Foreign Keys, save the script, then do some more search and replacing to add the ON DELETE CASCADE. Then I run the script, do my delete, and then run the other script. Is there an easier way to produce this script? This method seems far too prone to error and I will have to keep the script up to date with any other changes we make to the database, or re-generate it manually each time I may need to use it. Is an alternative option to run a select on the system tables to "generate" the script for me? Could it even be possible to run an update on a system table that enables and disables ON DELETE CASCADE?

@TITLE:How do you integrate Universal Analytics in to Chrome Extensions?
@CONTENT:The chrome extension guide has a tutorial for the old analytics install: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tut_analytics.html The instructions just say to link to the https version and update the manifest to allow loading scripts from that URL. So those should still apply to the new version. And in fact I can see the script loading from the server. Once the script loads analytics does not properly initialize it self and never processes it's internal queue (ga.f) to send those events to the server. There is no error in the console. It's just quietly does nothing. My guess is that the new Universal Analytics is just not set up to run in the the extension environment but the universal docs make no mention of that: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ does anyone know if it's even possible to add Universal Analytics to an extension yet and when that might be added?

@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: is f(void) deprecated in modern C and C++ Ok, so I have heard different opinions on this subject and just want to make sure I understand it correctly. For C++ Declarations void f(); and void f(void); mean precisely the same thing, the function f does not take any parameters. Ditto for definitions. For C Declaration void f(void); means that f does not take any parameters. Declaration void f(); means that function f may or may not have parameters, and if it does, we don't know what kind of parameters those are, or how many there is of them. Note that it is NOT the same as ellipsis, we can't use va_list. Now here is where things get interesting. Case 1 Declaration: void f();
 Definition: void f(int a, int b, float c)
{
   //...
}
 Case 2 Declaration: void f();
 Definition: void f()
{
   //...
}
 Question: What happens at compile time in cases 1 and 2 when we call f with the correct arguments, wrong arguments and no arguments at all? What happens at run time? Additional question: If I declare f with arguments, but define it without them, will it make a difference? Should I be able to address the arguments from the function body?
@CODE:void f(); void f(void); f void f(void); f void f(); f va_list void f(); void f(int a, int b, float c)

@LINK:/questions/10947159/writing-robust-r-code-namespaces-masking-and-using-the-operator
@TITLE:Writing robust R code: namespaces, masking and using the `::` operator
@CONTENT:Short version For those that don't want to read through my "case", this is the essence: What is the recommended way of minimizing the chances of new packages breaking existing code, i.e. of making the code you write as robust as possible? What is the recommended way of making the best use of the namespace mechanism when a) just using contributed packages (say in just some R Analysis Project)? b) with respect to developing own packages? How best to avoid conflicts with respect to formal classes (mostly Reference Classes in my case) as there isn't even a namespace mechanism comparable to :: for classes (AFAIU)? The way the R universe works This is something that's been nagging in the back of my mind for about two years now, yet I don't feel as if I have come to a satisfying solution. Plus I feel it's getting worse. We see an ever increasing number of packages on CRAN, github, R-Forge and the like, which is simply terrific. In such a decentralized environment, it is natural that the code base that makes up R (let's say that's base R and contributed R, for simplicity) will deviate from an ideal state with respect to robustness: people follow different conventions, there's S3, S4, S4 Reference Classes, etc. Things can't be as "aligned" as they would be if there were a "central clearing instance" that enforced conventions. That's okay. The problem Given the above, it can be very hard to use R to write robust code. Not everything you need will be in base R. For certain projects you will end up loading quite a few contributed packages. IMHO, the biggest issue in that respect is the way the namespace concept is put to use in R: R allows for simply writing the name of a certain function/method without explicitly requiring it's namespace (i.e. foo vs. namespace::foo). So for the sake of simplicity, that's what everyone is doing. But that way, name clashes, broken code and the need to rewrite/refactor your code are just a matter of time (or of the number of different packages loaded). At best, you will know about which existing functions are masked/overloaded by a newly added package. At worst, you will have no clue until your code breaks. A couple of examples: try loading RMySQL and RSQLite at the same time, they don't go along very well also RMongo will overwrite certain functions of RMySQL forecast masks a lot of stuff with respect to ARIMA-related functions R.utils even masks the base::parse routine (I can't recall which functions in particular were causing the problems, but am willing to look it up again if there's interest) Surprisingly, this doesn't seem to bother a lot of programmers out there. I tried to raise interest a couple of times at r-devel, to no significant avail. Downsides of using the :: operator Using the :: operator might significantly hurt efficiency in certain contexts as Dominick Samperi pointed out. When developing your own package, you can't even use the :: operator throughout your own code as your code is no real package yet and thus there's also no namespace yet. So I would have to initially stick to the foo way, build, test and then go back to changing everything to namespace::foo. Not really. Possible solutions to avoid these problems Reassign each function from each package to a variable that follows certain naming conventions, e.g. namespace..foo in order to avoid the inefficiencies associated with namespace::foo (I outlined it once here). Pros: it works. Cons: it's clumsy and you double the memory used. Simulate a namespace when developing your package. AFAIU, this is not really possible, at least I was told so back then. Make it mandatory to use namespace::foo. IMHO, that would be the best thing to do. Sure, we would lose some extend of simplicity, but then again the R universe just isn't simple anymore (at least it's not as simple as in the early 00's). And what about (formal) classes? Apart from the aspects described above, :: way works quite well for functions/methods. But what about class definitions? Take package timeDate with it's class timeDate. Say another package comes along which also has a class timeDate. I don't see how I could explicitly state that I would like a new instance of class timeDate from either of the two packages. Something like this will not work: new(timeDate::timeDate)
new("timeDate::timeDate")
new("timeDate", ns="timeDate")
 That can be a huge problem as more and more people switch to an OOP-style for their R packages, leading to lots of class definitions. If there is a way to explicitly address the namespace of a class definition, I would very much appreciate a pointer! Conclusion Even though this was a bit lengthy, I hope I was able to point out the core problem/question and that I can raise more awareness here. I think devtools and mvbutils do have some approaches that might be worth spreading, but I'm sure there's more to say.
@CODE::: foo namespace::foo base::parse :: :: :: foo namespace::foo namespace..foo namespace::foo namespace::foo :: timeDate timeDate timeDate new(timeDate::timeDate)

@TITLE:How should I visualize the structure of my code? [closed]
@CONTENT:I have an application written in Java. In is stored in several files. It uses different classes with different methods. The code is big and complicated. I think it would be easier to understand the code if I have a graphical model of the code (some kind of directed graph). Are there some standard methods for visualization of code. I am thinking about usage of UML (not sure it is a correct choice). Can anybody recommend me something? ADDED: I consider two possibilities: Creating the graph by hands (explicitly). Creating graph in an automatic way. For example to use some tools that read the available code and generate some graph describing the structure of the code. ADDED 2: It would be nice to have something for free.

@LINK:/questions/3431484/when-to-return-a-pointer-scalar-and-reference-in-c
@TITLE:When to return a pointer, scalar and reference in C++?
@CONTENT:I'm moving from Java to C++ and am a bit confused of the language's flexibility. One point is that there are three ways to store objects: A pointer, a reference and a scalar (storing the object itself if I understand it correctly). I tend to use references where possible, because that is as close to Java as possible. In some cases, e.g. getters for derived attributes, this is not possible: MyType &MyClass::getSomeAttribute() {
    MyType t;
    return t;
}
 This does not compile, because t exists only within the scope of getSomeAttribute() and if I return a reference to it, it would point nowhere before the client can use it. Therefore I'm left with two options: Return a pointer Return a scalar Returning a pointer would look like this: MyType *MyClass::getSomeAttribute() {
    MyType *t = new MyType;
    return t;
}
 This'd work, but the client would have to check this pointer for NULL in order to be really sure, something that's not necessary with references. Another problem is that the caller would have to make sure that t is deallocated, I'd rather not deal with that if I can avoid it. The alternative would be to return the object itself (scalar): MyType MyClass::getSomeAttribute() {
    MyType t;
    return t;
}
 That's pretty straightforward and just what I want in this case: It feels like a reference and it can't be null. If the object is out of scope in the client's code, it is deleted. Pretty handy. However, I rarely see anyone doing that, is there a reason for that? Is there some kind of performance problem if I return a scalar instead of a pointer or reference? What is the most common/elegant approach to handle this problem?
@CODE:MyType &MyClass::getSomeAttribute() {
    MyType t;
    return t;
} t getSomeAttribute() MyType *MyClass::getSomeAttribute() {
    MyType *t = new MyType;
    return t;
} NULL t MyType MyClass::getSomeAttribute() {
    MyType t;
    return t;
}

@CONTENT:I've been stuck on this for the last few hours. I got it working by hacking a few lines in /lib/Varien/Data/Collection/Db.php, but I'd rather use the proper solution and leave my core untouched. All I need to do is get a collection and filter it by two or more fields. Say, customer_firstname and remote_ip. Here's my (disfunctional without hacking Db.php) code: $collection = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->getCollection()->
addAttributeToSelect("*")->
addFieldToFilter(array(array('remote_ip', array('eq'=>'127.0.0.1')),
array('customer_firstname', array('eq'=>'gabe'))), array('eq'=>array(1,2,3)));
 With a stock Db.php, I tried this: (sample taken from http://magentoexpert.blogspot.com/2009/12/retrieve-products-with-specific.html) $collection->addFieldToFilter(array(
    array('name'=>'orig_price','eq'=>'Widget A'),
    array('name'=>'orig_price','eq'=>'Widget B'),           
));
 But that gives me this error: Warning: Illegal offset type in isset or empty  in magento/lib/Varien/Data/Collection/Db.php on line 369
 If I wrap that with a try/catch, then it moves into _getConditionSql() and gives this error: Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach()  in magento/lib/Varien/Data/Collection/Db.php on line 412

@LINK:/questions/2053498/order-of-uiviewcontroller-initialization-and-loading
@TITLE:Order of UIViewController initialization and loading
@CONTENT:I'm fairly new to UI programming on the Mac and iPhone, and I've run across something that somewhat puzzles me. A UIViewController has 3 methods that involve the initialization of it and its view: init (and init-like methods) loadView viewDidLoad (delegate method) I'd expect these to occur in the order above. First UIViewController is alloc'ed by some other object, then init is immediately called (or some other init method, like initWithStyle). Only once the object is initialized would I expect it to call its own loadView function, after which the view, once loaded, calls the viewDidLoad delegate method. This doesn't happen, for instance: @implementation UIViewControllerSubclass

- (id)init {
        NSLog(@"0");
    if (self = [super init]) {
        NSLog(@"1");
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)loadView {
    [super loadView];
    NSLog(@"2");
}

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    NSLog(@"3");
}

@end
 Produces the console output: 0

 The loadView and viewDidLoad methods, therefore, cannot make delegate calls, as the delegate is usually set after the call to [super init], which (as shown above) is called after loadView and viewDidLoad have run: UIViewControllerSubClass *someViewController = [[UIViewControllerSubclass alloc] init];
[viewController setDelegate:self];
 If I want to run code that sets up the ViewController in some way, notifying the delegate as it goes, should the code reside in the init method? Isn't the reason for loadView existing to allow such code to be run at the appropriate moment? It looks to me like I'll have to create a new initWithDelegate method which sets the delegate ivar before calling [super init], is this right, or am I going about this the wrong way? Thanks in advance :)
@CODE:@implementation UIViewControllerSubclass

- (id)init {
        NSLog(@"0");
    if (self = [super init]) {
        NSLog(@"1");
    }

}

@TITLE:Best way to cache images on ios app?
@CONTENT:Shortly, I have an NSDictionary with urls for images that I need to show in my UITableView. Each cell has a title and an image. I had successfully made this happen, although the scrolling was lagging, as it seemed like the cells downloaded their image every time they came into the screen. I searched for a bit, and found SDWebImage on github. This made the scroll-lagg go away. I am not completely sure what it did, but I believed it did some caching. But! Every time I open the app for the first time, I see NO images, and I have to scroll down, and back up for them to arrive. And if I exit the app with home-button, and open again, then it seemes like the caching is working, because the images on the screen are visible, however, if I scroll one cell down, then the next cell has no image. Until i scroll past it and back up, or if I click on it. Is this how caching is supposed to work? Or what is the best way to cache images downloaded from the web? The images are being updated rarily, so I was close to just import them to the project, but I like to have the possibility to update images without uploading an update.. Is it impossible to load all the images for the whole tableview form the cache(given that there is something in the cache) at launch? Is that why I sometimes see cells without images? And yes, I'm having a hard time understanding what cache is. --EDIT-- I tried this with only images of the same size (500x150), and the aspect-error is gone, however when I scroll up or down, there are images on all cells, but at first they are wrong. After the cell has been in the view for some milliseconds, the right image appears. This is amazingly annoying, but maybe how it has to be?.. It seemes like it chooses the wrong index from the cache at first. If I scroll slow, then I can see the images blink from wrong image to the correct one. If I scroll fast, then I believe the wrong images are visible at all times, but I can't tell due to the fast scrolling. When the fast scrolling slows down and eventually stops, the wrong images still appear, but immediately after it stops scrolling, it updates to the right images. I also have a custom UITableViewCell class, but I haven't made any big changes.. I haven't gone through my code very much yet, but I can't think of what may be wrong..

@TITLE:Is there an inituitive UML approach to depict threads
@CONTENT:I'm fond of using UML diagrams to describe my software. In the majority of cases the diagrams are for my own use and I use them for more involved pieces of code, interactions etc. where I'll benefit from being able to look back over them in the future. One thing I've found myself doing a few different ways is diagramming threads. Threads by their nature tend to pop up in the more involved pieces of code and keeping track of them is often a primary purpose of my design documents. In the past I've used a symbol in a sequence diagram to show the creation of a new thread but looking back at some diagrams doing that it's sometimes ambiguous between an object's lifetime - which sequence diagrams are for - and a thread's lifetime. Is there a better approach for incorporating threads into UML?

@CONTENT:Is there a way to get AWS pricing programmatically (cost per hour of each instance type, cost per GB/month of storage on S3, and etc)? Also, are there cost monitoring tools? For example, is there a tool that can report your EC2 instance usage on an hourly basis (versus a monthly basis, which is what Amazon does)? Thanks in advance.

@LINK:/questions/5728454/playing-back-sound-coming-from-microphone-in-real-time
@TITLE:Playing back sound coming from microphone in real-time
@CONTENT:I've been trying to get my application recording the sound coming from the microphone and playing it back in (approximately) real-time, however without success. I'm using AudioRecord and AudioTrack classes for record and playback, respectively. I've tried different approaches, I've tried to record the incoming sound and write it to a file and it worked fine. I've also tried to playback sound from that file AFTER with AudioTrack and it worked fine too. The problem is when I try to play the sound in real-time, instead of reading a file after it's written. Here is the code: //variables
private int audioSource = MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC;
private int samplingRate = 44100; /* in Hz*/
private int channelConfig = AudioFormat.CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO;
private int audioFormat = AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT;
private int bufferSize = AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize(samplingRate, channelConfig, audioFormat);
private int sampleNumBits = 16;
private int numChannels = 1;

// ¡K

AudioRecord recorder = new AudioRecord(audioSource, samplingRate, channelConfig, audioFormat, bufferSize);
                recorder.startRecording();
                isRecording = true;

AudioTrack audioPlayer = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 44100, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION_MONO,
                        AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, bufferSize, AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM);

if(audioPlayer.getPlayState() != AudioTrack.PLAYSTATE_PLAYING)
    audioPlayer.play();

//capture data and record to file
int readBytes=0, writtenBytes=0;
do{
   readBytes = recorder.read(data, 0, bufferSize);

   if(AudioRecord.ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION != readBytes){
      writtenBytes += audioPlayer.write(data, 0, readBytes);
   }
}
while(isRecording);
 It is thrown a java.lang.IllegalStateException with the reason being caused by "play() called on a uninitialized AudioTrack". However, if I change the AudioTrack initialization for example to use sampling rate 8000Hz and sample format 8 bits (instead of 16), it doesn't throw the exception anymore and the application runs, although it produces horrible noise. When I play AudioTrack from a file, there is no problem with the initialization of the AudioTrack, I tried 44100 and 16 bits and it worked properly, producing the correct sound. Any help ?

@CONTENT:I have found the "pure SQL" answers to this question. Is there a way, in Rails, to reset the id field for a specific table? Why do I want to do this? Because I have tables with constantly moving data - rarely more than 100 rows, but always different. It is up to 25k now, and there's just no point in that. I intend on using a scheduler internal to the Rails app (rufus-scheduler) to run the id field reset monthly or so.

@TITLE:Making a Django form class with a dynamic number of fields
@CONTENT:I'm working on something like an online store. I'm making a form in which the customer buys an item, and she can choose how many of these item she would like to buy. But, on every item that she buys she needs to choose what its color would be. So there's a non-constant number of fields: If the customer buys 3 items, she should get 3 <select> boxes for choosing a color, if she buys 7 items, she should get 7 such <select> boxes. I'll make the HTML form fields appear and disappear using JavaScript. But how do I deal with this on my Django form class? I see that form fields are class attributes, so I don't know how to deal with the fact that some form instance should have 3 color fields and some 7. Any clue?

@CONTENT:Here's a code of how I get currency symbol now: NSLocale *lcl = [[[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"au_AU"] autorelease];
NSNumberFormatter *fmtr = [[[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init] autorelease];

[fmtr setLocale:lcl];

NSLog( @"%@", [lcl displayNameForKey:NSLocaleCurrencySymbol value:@"AUD"] );
NSLog( @"%@", [fmtr currencySymbol] );
 Both NSLogs return "AU$". As I understood from Apple development documentation, there are at least two currency symbols for each currency (these symbols could be the same, though) - local (that is used within a country. $ for Australia, for example) and international (AU$ for Australia). So, the question is how to get LOCAL currency symbol. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:Building Python and more on missing modules
@CONTENT:I have another thread asking help on "missing zlib". With the nice help the problem has been resolved (almost). Now I am interested in building Python myself (on Ubuntu 10.10). A few important questions have caught my attention: After building Python (say 2.7.1), do I need to rebuild Python if I have missing modules? Is there a way to find out what modules will be missing prior to building Python? Say sqlite3. I have sqlite3 installed for the system default (Python 2.6.6), and I can import that into Python 2.6.6 shell. Now I use pythonbrew to build 2.7.1, and in the shell I cannot import sqlite3 because _sqlite3 is not available. I am sure there are a few more important one missing which I need for future development (such as Django..). I am willing to learn how to build without using pythonbrew. Please share with me your experience in building another version of Python, and how would you address the problem of missing modules? Is there a practical solution to building Python? I have never bothered building one myself, so please bear with me. I am beginning to realize the importance of learning and building one myself! Thank you very much! EDIT First I thank you all of your inputs. They meant a lot. I did the building. Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
_bsddb             _curses            _curses_panel   
_tkinter           bsddb185           bz2             
dbm                gdbm               readline        
sunaudiodev        _sqlite3                                    
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.
 I got sqlite3 and readline away by sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
 I tried to import them, but still "no named module xxxx". At AskUbuntu I actually asked people how to get previous commands because I couldn't use that feature when I am in Python 2.7.1 shell. I believe it's due to readline. Readline I installed the Python-2.7.1 under this directory: /home/jwxie518/python27/ I looked into setup.py, I found the following lines: # The sqlite interface
sqlite_setup_debug = False   # verbose debug prints from this script?

# We hunt for #define SQLITE_VERSION "n.n.n"
# We need to find >= sqlite version 3.0.8
sqlite_incdir = sqlite_libdir = None
sqlite_inc_paths = [ '/usr/include',
                     '/usr/include/sqlite',
                     '/usr/include/sqlite3',
                     '/usr/local/include',
                     '/usr/local/include/sqlite',
                     '/usr/local/include/sqlite3',
                   ]
 All the paths listed above do not exist. So I guess I have to install sqlite3 manually? I got another reference here (it's in Chinese, however) # Download the latest and extract
# Go into the extracted directory
./configure --prefix=/home/jwxie518/python27/python
make && make install
# Then edit python-2.7 's setup.py before rebuild it
# Sample (add these two lines to the end....)
'~/share/software/python/sqlite-3.6.20/include',
'~/share/software/python/sqlite-3.6.20/include/sqlite3',

# Then rebuild python like how we did before
 I went into my directory where I installed sqlite3. I found include/sqlite3.h only. So I went back and check /usr/include/. I can only find sqlite3.h too. So what is going on here? Readline is also non-importable. 3RD EDIT I started everything over, except I didn't reinstall sqlite3. # Extract Python-2.7.1
# cd into Python-2.7.1
# ./configure
make >make.out 2>&1
less make.out
 make.out is here: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7k3BfxZQ I still couldn't import sqlite3. So I went into setup.py and made changes: # We hunt for #define SQLITE_VERSION "n.n.n"
# We need to find >= sqlite version 3.0.8
sqlite_incdir = sqlite_libdir = None
sqlite_inc_paths = [ '/usr/include',
                     '/usr/include/sqlite',
                     '/usr/include/sqlite3',
                     '/usr/local/include',
                     '/usr/local/include/sqlite',
                     '/usr/local/include/sqlite3',
                     '/home/jwxie518/python-mod/include/sqlite',
                     '/home/jwxie518/python-mod/include/sqlite3',
                   ]
 Then again, ran everything over (this time I also did make clean) Output is here: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=8ZKgAcWn According to the output, I don't think the custom path is included.... (for complete output please go to the link above and search for sqlite) build/temp.linux-i686-2.7/home/jwxie518/Python-2.7.1/Modules/_sqlite/util.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R/usr/lib -lsqlite3 -o build/lib.linux-i686-2.7/_sqlite3.so I still cannot import sqlite3. THanks! Thank you very much, Michael Dillon, for helping me out. Your tutorial was neat and clear. I solved the problem as soon as I realized whenever I tried Python-2.7.1, I was actually using the one installed by Pythonbrew. The moral of the story is read all the errors. I neglected the errors generated by importing sqlite3. The one installed by Pythonbrew didn't have sqlite3 installed. The development package for sqlite3 was installed after Pythonbrew installed the Python-2.7.1 Thanks.

After previously trying to implement drag and drop with ember + jquery-ui and having difficulty using this solution: http://jsfiddle.net/Wu2cu/2/, I saw pangratz's HTML5 solution: http://jsfiddle.net/pangratz666/DYnNH/ and decided to give it a shot. I have forked pangratz's jsfiddle, created a productsController and an addedToCartController that filters the productsController based on an isAdded property: http://jsfiddle.net/GU8N7/3/ That works fine, but then I get stuck when I try to use an #each iterator and append unique draggable views to each object in the iterator. I want to be able to drag each "product" object, and when it is dropped into the "shopping cart" area, set that object's isAdded property to true, thus having it show up in the "shopping cart." Any help would be greatly appreciated!! (also as a bonus, I'd like to make the items in the shopping cart sortable, but that's probably too much to ask for until the first bridge is crossed.)

After tapping on an anchor link in the fixed position navbar, it correctly takes me to that anchor. However, I am then unable to click on any other links in the navbar until after I have scrolled the page. The problem appears to be in Bootstrap itself, since the Bootstrap site has the same issue: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ Any suggestions for how to work around this?

@TITLE:How to interact with leaflet marker layer from outside the map
@CONTENT:I am hitting a wall. I have a leaflet map showing points for public art pieces, rendered from GeoJson. Next to the map, I have also rendered a list of the pieces from the same GeoJson data and want to be able to click on an item from the list outside of the map and have the related marker on the map's popup come up. The Question: How do I make it so that my list of items can be linked to their respective markers on the map through a click event? My map.js file looks like this: var map;

@TITLE:A RESTful persistence solution usable with backbone.js¡K in PHP?
@CONTENT:I'll preface this with saying that I'm a crappy programmer, I'm sure that what I want to do could be done in 10 lines of node or Rails or something else, but PHP is what I have available. So, I'm hoping to find a simple PHP library which wraps the database calls in an API that looks similar to the RESTful model. I've had little success trying to find such a thing -- searching for PHP CRUD or PHP REST turns up several zillion pages, and I've no idea how to filter through them. I'm really trying to keep things simple here, I don't want a big framework like Zend or something. The models I'm dealing with in Backbone are really simple. I just want to send GETs to, say, /notes/3 or POSTs to /notes, etc, and have PHP do the right thing to a database. Perhaps I'm asking too much, but it seems to me that this is what other frameworks like Rails provide. Any suggestions? TIA...

@LINK:/questions/6540710/ios-cvimagebuffer-distorted-from-avcapturesessiondataoutput-with-avcapturesessio
@TITLE:iOS CVImageBuffer distorted from AVCaptureSessionDataOutput with AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto
@CONTENT:At a high level, I created an app that lets a user point his or her iPhone camera around and see video frames that have been processed with visual effects. Additionally, the user can tap a button to take a freeze-frame of the current preview as a high-resolution photo that is saved in their iPhone library. To do this, the app follows this procedure: 1) Create an AVCaptureSession captureSession = [[AVCaptureSession alloc] init];
[captureSession setSessionPreset:AVCaptureSessionPreset640x480];
 2) Hook up an AVCaptureDeviceInput using the back-facing camera. videoInput = [[[AVCaptureDeviceInput alloc] initWithDevice:backFacingCamera error:&error] autorelease];
[captureSession addInput:videoInput];
 3) Hook up an AVCaptureStillImageOutput to the session to be able to capture still frames at Photo resolution. stillOutput = [[AVCaptureStillImageOutput alloc] init];
[stillOutput setOutputSettings:[NSDictionary
    dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA]
    forKey:(id)kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey]];
[captureSession addOutput:stillOutput];
 4) Hook up an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput to the session to be able to capture individual video frames (CVImageBuffers) at a lower resolution videoOutput = [[AVCaptureVideoDataOutput alloc] init];
[videoOutput setVideoSettings:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA] forKey:(id)kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey]];
[videoOutput setSampleBufferDelegate:self queue:dispatch_get_main_queue()];
[captureSession addOutput:videoOutput];
 5) As video frames are captured, the delegate's method is called with each new frame as a CVImageBuffer: - (void)captureOutput:(AVCaptureOutput *)captureOutput didOutputSampleBuffer:(CMSampleBufferRef)sampleBuffer fromConnection:(AVCaptureConnection *)connection
{
    CVImageBufferRef pixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer);
    [self.delegate processNewCameraFrame:pixelBuffer];
}
 6) Then the delegate processes/draws them: - (void)processNewCameraFrame:(CVImageBufferRef)cameraFrame {
    CVPixelBufferLockBaseAddress(cameraFrame, 0);
    int bufferHeight = CVPixelBufferGetHeight(cameraFrame);
    int bufferWidth = CVPixelBufferGetWidth(cameraFrame);

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    glGenTextures(1, &videoFrameTexture_);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, videoFrameTexture_);
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);

    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, bufferWidth, bufferHeight, 0, GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddress(cameraFrame));

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, [self vertexBuffer]);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, [self indexBuffer]);

    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 4, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, BUFFER_OFFSET(0));

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
    [[self context] presentRenderbuffer:GL_RENDERBUFFER];

    glDeleteTextures(1, &videoFrameTexture_);

    CVPixelBufferUnlockBaseAddress(cameraFrame, 0);
}
 This all works and leads to the correct results. I can see a video preview of 640x480 processed through OpenGL. It looks like this: However, if I capture a still image from this session, its resolution will also be 640x480. I want it to be high resolution, so in step one I change the preset line to: [captureSession setSessionPreset:AVCaptureSessionPresetPhoto];
 This correctly captures still images at the highest resolution for the iPhone4 (2592x1936). However, the video preview (as received by the delegate in steps 5 and 6) now looks like this: I've confirmed that every other preset (High, medium, low, 640x480, and 1280x720) previews as intended. However, the Photo preset seems to send buffer data in a different format. I've also confirmed that the data being sent to the buffer at the Photo preset is actually valid image data by taking the buffer and creating a UIImage out of it instead of sending it to openGL: CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
CGContextRef context = CGBitmapContextCreate(CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddress(cameraFrame), bufferWidth, bufferHeight, 8, bytesPerRow, colorSpace, kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little | kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst); 
CGImageRef cgImage = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(context); 
UIImage *anImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:cgImage];
 This shows an undistorted video frame. I've done a bunch of searching and can't seem to fix it. My hunch is that it's a data format issue. That is, I believe that the buffer is being set correctly, but with a format that this line doesn't understand: glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, bufferWidth, bufferHeight, 0, GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddress(cameraFrame));
 My hunch was that changing the external format from GL_BGRA to something else would help, but it doesn't... and through various means it looks like the buffer is actually in GL_BGRA. Does anyone know what's going on here? Or do you have any tips on how I might go about debugging why this is happening? (What's super weird is that this happens on an iphone4 but not on an iPhone 3GS ... both running ios4.3)

I do have the 'tlsmail' gem installed and the 'mail' gem as well, and my application is in development mode. Help me fix this error so that i can happily continue my rails journey and if possible guide me a little over this :address issue in the right direction so that i understand the basics of this.

I can modify the Users table which has been creted for me but I am unsure as to the "correct" way to modify the extra fields I have added. I want Fullname, Email etc and have added them to the user table but there appears no way to update through the SimpleMembership WebSecurity.* static methods. Are you supposed to just update those properties yourself using EF outside of the SimpleMembership API?

@TITLE:Android Service need to run always(Never pause or stop)
@CONTENT:I created a service and want to run this service always until my phone restart or force closed. The service should run in background. Sample code of created service and start services. Start the service: Intent service = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MyService.class);
getApplicationContext().startService(service);
 The service: public class MyService extends Service {

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        // TODO do something useful
        HFLAG = true;
        //smsHandler.sendEmptyMessageDelayed(DISPLAY_DATA, 1000);
        return Service.START_NOT_STICKY;
    }

    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        // TODO for communication return IBinder implementation
        return null;
    }
}
 Manifest declaration: <service
    android:name=".MyService"
    android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name" >

 Is it possible to run this service always as when the application pause and anything else. After some time my application goes pause and the services also going pause or stop. So how can I run this service in background and always.
@CODE:Intent service = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MyService.class);

@TITLE:supporting multiple resolution and density of images in phonegap
@CONTENT:I am new to phonegap and facing a problem, I am making a phonegap app which will run on multiple platform devices of different screen size and different screen resolution so I have to load images of different resolution depending on screen resolution. this can be achieved in android by simply putting your images of different resolution in hdpi, mdpi and ldpi folder and it(android) fetches images automatically depending on devices screen resolution. But how to do this in phonegap. I have seen lot of articles on responsive web design they all say about positioning the elements on web page but non of them has told about how to place images on the basis of screen resolutions. thanks i advance. edited question i have used following code for html <div id="header" data-role="header" data-position="fixed">
 <img alt="app_icon" src="pictures/app_logo.png" display="inline" class="align-left" />
 <img alt="brand_icon" src="pictures/company_logo.png" display="inline" class="align-right" /><h1></h1>
</div>
 now I have images inside assets/www/pictures folder. this folder consists of 2 images of same resolution app_logo.png and company_logo.png and 2 images of higher resolution app_logo_big.png and company_logo_big.png now through media queries i will know the screen size and apply the styles but as far as i know i cannot change img src from css. So now how will i use these images of different resolution
@CODE:<div id="header" data-role="header" data-position="fixed">
 <img alt="app_icon" src="pictures/app_logo.png" display="inline" class="align-left" />

@LINK:/questions/1829269/efficient-way-to-send-images-via-wcf
@TITLE:Efficient way to send images via WCF?
@CONTENT:I am learning WCF, LINQ and a few other technologies by writing, from scratch, a custom remote control application like VNC. I am creating it with three main goals in mind: The server will provide 'remote control' on an application level (i.e. seamless windows) instead of full desktop access. The client can select any number of applications that are running on the server and receive a stream of images of each of them. A client can connect to more than one server simultaneously. Right now I am using WCF to send an array of Bytes that represents the window being sent: using (var ms = new MemoryStream()) {
    window.GetBitmap().Save(ms, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
    frame.Snapshot = ms.ToArray();
}
 GetBitmap implementation: var wRectangle = GetRectangle();
var image = new Bitmap(wRectangle.Width, wRectangle.Height);
var gfx = Graphics.FromImage(image);

gfx.CopyFromScreen(wRectangle.Left, wRectangle.Top, 0, 0, wRectangle.Size, CopyPixelOperation.SourceCopy);

return image;
 It is then sent via WCF (TCPBinding and it will always be over LAN) to the client and reconstructed in a blank windows form with no border like this: using (var ms = new MemoryStream(_currentFrame.Snapshot))
{
    BackgroundImage = Image.FromStream(ms);
}
 I would like to make this process as efficient as possible in both CPU and memory usage with bandwidth coming in third place. I am aiming to have the client connect to 5+ servers with 10+ applications per server. Is my existing method the best approach (while continuing to use these technologies) and is there anything I can do to improve it? Ideas that I am looking into (but I have no experience with): Using an open source graphics library to capture and save the images instead of .Net solution. Saving as PNG or another image type rather than JPG. Send image deltas instead of a full image every time. Try and 'record' the windows and create a compressed video stream instead of picture snapshots (mpeg?).
@CODE:using (var ms = new MemoryStream()) {
    window.GetBitmap().Save(ms, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
    frame.Snapshot = ms.ToArray();
} var wRectangle = GetRectangle();
var image = new Bitmap(wRectangle.Width, wRectangle.Height);
var gfx = Graphics.FromImage(image);

gfx.CopyFromScreen(wRectangle.Left, wRectangle.Top, 0, 0, wRectangle.Size, CopyPixelOperation.SourceCopy);

return image; using (var ms = new MemoryStream(_currentFrame.Snapshot))
{
    BackgroundImage = Image.FromStream(ms);

@TITLE:What's the difference between Spring Data's MongoTemplate and MongoRepository?
@CONTENT:I need to write an application with which I can do complex queries using spring-data and mongodb. I have been starting by using the MongoRepository but struggled with complex queries to find examples or to actually understand the Syntax. I'm talking about queries like this: @Repository
public interface UserRepositoryInterface extends MongoRepository<User, String> {
    List<User> findByEmailOrLastName(String email, String lastName);
}
 or the use of JSON based queries which I tried by trial and error because I don't get the syntax right. Even after reading the mongodb documentation (non-working example due to wrong syntax). @Repository
public interface UserRepositoryInterface extends MongoRepository<User, String> {
    @Query("'$or':[{'firstName':{'$regex':?0,'$options':'i'}},{'lastName':{'$regex':?0,'$options':'i'}}]")
    List<User> findByEmailOrFirstnameOrLastnameLike(String searchText);
} 
 After reading through all the documentation it seems that mongoTemplate is far better documented then MongoRepository. I'm referring to following documentation: http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/reference.html Can you tell me what is more convenient and powerful to use? mongoTemplate or MongoRepository? Are both same mature or does one of them lack more features then the other?

@CONTENT:On the latest version of Android app Facebook showed lock screen notification feature (like on this screenshot - http://imgur.com/5eA8iT9). Did anyone try to implement this? I know that It's simple to show Activity on top of lock screen, but unfortunately It doesn't work with translucent background. Basically it works but below our activity we see launcher screen, not lock screen (like lock screen in this case would be also transparent). What I tried right now is: getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED);
getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD);
getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);
getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON);
 in my Activity. Also I tried this example: https://gist.github.com/daichan4649/5352944 And as I described - everything works but no transparency. From my observation Facebook uses theme: @android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar
 and doesn't have permission: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD" />
 Also I noticed that lock screen notification aquires touches so we cannot show notifications from statusbar by gesture. Any ideas how to create that kind of notification before Android L release.

@TITLE:AngularJS + Django Rest Framework + CORS ( CSRF Cookie not showing up in client )
@CONTENT:I am developing a 1-page application in AngularJS using and Django Rest Framework + Django CORS Headers. My problem is that the "csrftoken" cookie never shows up in my browser when I have contacted the backend. For example: I am doing a login using a post. I get the "sessionid" cookie properly but the "csrftoken" never shows up and therefor I cannot do proper posts from my client since I will get denied due the lack of the csrf token. I have analyzed the response headers from the API and the csrftoken is not ther. I have looked directly in the rest API browser and it shows up fine there. Just to point out, I can do my first POST to login since Django Rest Framework only forces CSRF for authenticated users. If I try to relogin it will fail since the "sessionid"-cookie it present. I am not interessted in bypassing the CSRF protection as some posts on stackoverflow suggests. Some code snippets from front/backend. These are unfinnished snippets, so dont get hung up on poorly written code. Backend API LoginView class LoginView(APIView):

@TITLE:How to set angular controller object property value from directive in child scope
@CONTENT:I have have a directive inside an ng-repeater that should set a scope property. Please see the fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/paos/CSbRB/ The problem is that the scope property is given as an attribute value like this: <button ng-update1="inputdata.title">click me</button>
 The directive is supposed to set the scope property inputdata.title to some string. This does not work: app.directive('ngUpdate1', function() {
    return function(scope, element, attrs) {
        element.bind('click', function() {

                scope[ attrs.ngUpdate1 ] = "Button 1";
            });
        });
    };
});
 However, assigning directly works: scope["inputdata"]["title"] = "Button 1";
 Can you please tell me how I can set a scope property with . notation in its name from a directive? PS: The reason the fiddle is using a repeater is because it makes the directives be in child scopes. When they are in a child scope, you can't write to scope properties that are primitives. That's why I need an object property with "." in the name. See the long explanation here: What are the nuances of scope prototypal / prototypical inheritance in AngularJS? Thank you

 CoreData is the name of my app. I've tried to put in initial data into the app by finding the path to the sqlite file in my iPhone simulator, and then going and inserting into that sqlite file.

I'm happy to post the relevant code from my app that would help shed some light on this problem but there's tons of code relating to Core Data which I don't understand, so I'm not sure what part to post! Any help is greatly appreciated.
@CODE:NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"CoreData" ofType:@"momd"];
if (!path) {
    path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"CoreData" ofType:@"mom"];
}
NSAssert(path != nil, @"Unable to find Resource in main bundle");

@TITLE:extract rotation, scale values from 2d transformation matrix
@CONTENT:how can i extract rotation, scale and translation values from 2d transformation matrix? i mean a have a 2d transformation matrix = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

matrix.rotate(45 / 180 * PI)
matrix.scale(3, 4)
matrix.translate(50, 100)
matrix.rotate(30 / 180 * PI)
matrix.scale(-2, 4)
 now my matrix have values [a, b, c, d, tx, ty] lets forget about the processes above and imagine that we have only the values a, b, c, d, tx, ty how can i find total rotation and scale values via a, b, c, d, tx, ty sorry for my english Thanks your advance EDIT I think it should be an answer somewhere... i just tried in Flash Builder (AS3) like this    var m:Matrix = new Matrix;
   m.rotate(.25 * Math.PI);
   m.scale(4, 5);
   m.translate(100, 50);
   m.rotate(.33 * Math.PI);
   m.scale(-3, 2.5);

   var shape:Shape = new Shape;
   shape.transform.matrix = m;

   trace(shape.x, shape.y, shape.scaleX, shape.scaleY, shape.rotation);
 and the output is: x = -23.6 
y = 278.8 
scaleX = 11.627334873920528 
scaleY = -13.54222263865791 
rotation = 65.56274134518259 (in degrees)
@CODE:matrix = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

matrix.rotate(45 / 180 * PI)

@TITLE:Arrange 0's & 1's in a array
@CONTENT:This is one of an interview question which I had recently. I would like to know others perception of approach for this problem. Question: You are given a structure which holds employee details with two elements, int department and string name. struct Employee
{ 
    string Name;
    int Dept;
}
 You are given details of N Employees, among which N/2 employees have Dept == 0 and N/2 employees have Dept == 1, arranged in some arbitrary order. You need to sort the employee details based on their Dept value and it should be stable i.e., the order of 1s and 0s in the original record should be maintained. For example, given the following sample data: 
Name         Dept

X1           0
X2           1
X3           0
X4           1
X5           0
 after sorting the result should be: 
Name         Dept

X2           1
X4           1
X1           0
X3           0
X5           0
 The algorithm should be stable and the time complexity should be O(N), with constant space for additional variables (which means sorting should be done in-place).

{ 
    string Name;

@TITLE:Wildcard Subdomains
@CONTENT:I know there have been a few threads on this before, but I have tried absolutely everything suggested (that I could find) and nothing has worked for me thus far... With that in mind, here is what I'm trying to do: First, I want to allow users to publish pages and give them each a subdomain of their choice (ex: user.mysite.com). From what I can gather, the best way to do this is to map user.mysite.com to mysite.com/user with mod_rewrite and .htaccess - is that correct? If that is correct, can somebody give me explicit instructions on how to do this? Also, I am doing all of my development locally, using MAMP, so if somebody could tell me how to set up my local environment to work in the same manner (I've read this is more difficult), I would greatly appreciate it. Honestly, I have been trying a everything to no avail, and since this is my first time doing something like this, I am completely lost. Thanks so much for any help! Update: Some of these answers have been REALLY helpful, but for the system I have in mind, manually adding a subdomain for each user is not an option. What I'm really asking is how to do this on the fly, and redirect wildcard.mysite.com to mysite.com/wildcard -- the way Tumblr is set up is a perfect example of what I'd like to do. Thanks again!

@LINK:/questions/15490265/rest-web-service-authentication-token-implementation
@TITLE:REST Web Service authentication token implementation
@CONTENT:I'm implementing a REST web service using C# which will be hosted on Azure as a cloud service. Since it is a REST service, it is stateless and therefore no cookies or session states. The web service can only be accessed over HTTPS (Certificate provided by StartSSL.com). Upon a user successfully logging into the service they will get a security token. This token will provide authentication in future communications. The token will contain a timestamp, userid and ip address of the client. All communication will only happen over HTTPS so I'm not concerned about the token being intercepted and used in replay attacks; the token will have an expiry anyway. Since this is a public facing service I am however concerned that someone could register with the service, login and then modifying the token that they receive to access the accounts of other users. I'm wondering how best to secure the content of the token and also verify that it hasn't been tampered with. I plan on doing the following to secure the token: The client successfully logs into the service and the service does: Generate a random value and hash it with SHA256 1000 times. Generate a one-time session key from private key + hashed random value. Hash the session key with SHA256 1000 times and then use it to encrypt the token Use private key to sign the encrypted token using RSA. Sends the encrypted token + the signature + the hashed random value to the client in an unencrypted JSON package. When the client calls a service it sends the encrypted token and signature in an unencrypted JSON package to the service. The service will Recreate the session key from the private key + the hashed random value Use the private key to verify the signature Use the hashed session key to decrypt the token Check that the token hasn't expired Continue with the requested operation... I don't really know anything about encryption so I have some questions: Is this sufficient or is it overkill? I read that to detect tampering I should include an HMAC with the token. Since I am signing with the private key, do I still need an HMAC? Should I be using Rijndael instead of RSA? If Rijndael is preferred, is the generated IV required for decrypted? i.e. can i throw it away or do I need to send it will the encrypted token? e.g. Encrypted Token + HMAC + IV + hashed random value. Since all communication happens over HTTPS the unencrypted JSON package isn't really unencrypted until it reaches the client. Also I may want to re-implement the service in PHP later so this all needs to be doable in PHP as well. Thanks for your help

The application has a service and it starts on boot,connect to the usb serial port and do the other things. my problem is that the host device does not have any interaction with user, so when the android asks Allow the app "MyAPP" to access the USB device ?
[checkmark]Use by default for this USB device
Cancel            OK
 there is no person to click on ok. even when I check the use by default... checkbox,If I reinsert the USB ,or reboot the host device, it asks again on next boot. I ran the service and app with SuperUser mode,but no difference,it asks again. I added intent filter but no difference,it asks me every time.         <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED" />
            <action android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_DEVICE_DETACHED" />

@LINK:/questions/4239714/why-cant-i-style-a-control-with-the-aero-theme-applied-in-wpf-4-0
@TITLE:Why can't I style a control with the Aero theme applied in WPF 4.0?
@CONTENT:I recently converted a project from WPF 3.5 to WPF 4.0. Functionally, everything works, but the DataGrid style I was applying on top of the Aero theme has suddenly stopped working. As you can see from the before/after pictures below, my DataGrids went from having an Aero look plus bold headings, extra padding, and alternating row formats to just looking plain "Aero". Besides removing all references to the WPF Toolkit (since the DataGrid is now native to WPF 4.0), I really didn't change anything about my code/markup. Before (WPF Toolkit DataGrid) After (.NET 4.0 DataGrid) As I learned in an earlier question, I am able to get the custom DataGrid styling to work again if I stop referencing the Aero resource dictionary, but then everything looks "Luna" on Windows XP (which is not what I want). So, how do I ensure that my app always uses the Aero theme, but still apply styling on top of that theme in WPF 4.0? Here is my App.xaml code: <Application

 Edit It just occurred to me that maybe the problem is that I'm referencing the wrong version of the Aero framework. Here's what I have now: <ResourceDictionary

 Should this be updated to version 4.0? What is the PublicKeyToken for version 4 (or how do I figure this out)?

It's unclear to me what the difference is between them and my Google searches have not turned up any decent explanations. I'd like to understand the differences between them and ideally see some examples of when to use one over the other.

@TITLE:Section vs Article HTML5
@CONTENT:I have a page made up of various "sections" like videos, a newsfeed etc.. I am a bit confused how to represent these with HTML5. Currently I have them as HTML5 <section>s, but on further inspection it looks they the more correct tag would be <article>. Could anyone shed some light on this for me? None of these things are blog posts or "documents" in the true sense of the word so it's kind of hard to see which element to apply. Cheers EDIT: I have opted to use the article tag since it seems to be a container tag for unrelated elements which I guess my "sections" are. The actual tagname article however seems to be rather misleading and although they are saying HTML5 has been developed with greater consideration for web applications, I find a lot of the tags to be more blog-centric / document based. Anyway thanks for your answers it appears to be fairly subjective.

Eclipse is a great IDE. With the Pydev extension, it that can be used to develop Python I run pep8.py manually when I'm scripting, but with bigger projects I prefer to use Eclipse. It would be really useful to integrate pep8.py in Eclipse/Pydev, so it can be run automatically in all the files in the project, and point to the lines containing the warnings. Maybe there is an obvious way to do it, but I haven't found it yet. Question is: How to integrate pep8.py in Eclipse?

The associated CommandBinding provides a callback for the evaluation of CanExecute which controls the enabled state of each MenuItem. This almost works. The menu items initially come up with the correct enabled and disabled states. However when the data that my CanExecute callback uses changes, I need the command to re-request a result from my callback in order for this new state to be reflected in the UI. There do not appear to be any public methods on RoutedCommand or CommandBinding for this. Note that the callback is used again when I click or type into the control (I guess it's triggered on input because mouse-over doesn't cause the refresh).

System.Threading.Thread is still there, it just doesn't have the Sleep method. I need to delay something for a few seconds in my app, is there a suitable replacement? EDIT why the delay is needed: My app is a game and the delay is to make it look like the computer opponent is "thinking" about his next move. The method is already called asynchronously (main thread isn't blocked), I just want to slow the response time down.

@CONTENT:I was wondering peoples opinions on the naming of ID columns in database tables. If I have a table called Invoices with a primary key of an identity column I would call that column InvoiceID so that I would not conflict with other tables and it's obvious what it is. Where I am workind current they have called all ID columns ID. So they would do the following: Select  
    i.ID 
,   il.ID 
From
    Invoices i
    Left Join InvoiceLines il
        on i.ID = il.InvoiceID
 Now, I see a few problems here: 1. You would need to alias the columns on the select 2. ID = InvoiceID does not fit in my brain 3. If you did not alias the tables and referred to InvoiceID is it obvious what table it is on? What are other peoples thoughts on the topic?

Although it is not related to the usage scenarios of stackalloc, I actually do a considerable amount of legacy interop in my apps, so every now and then I could resort to using unsafe code. But nevertheless I usually find ways to avoid unsafe completely. And since stack size for a single thread in .Net is ~1Mb (correct me if I'm wrong), I am even more reserved from using stackalloc. Are there some practical cases where one could say: "this is exactly the right amount of data and processing for me to go unsafe and use stackalloc"?

But since I started to play with it for big toys, I started to notice random/unknown fatal error and crashes (with x.264 codecs etc), it was a nightmare till then to get ride of system crash+fatal errors caused by Open JDK. After getting completely frustrated and tired with Open JDK, I finally decided to switch into Oracle JDK 7. Since then my fatal errors/crashes were gone. Still doing trace to see if it occurs but never got those system crashes yet. Now I am wondering, if Open JDK is only a license issue, why is stability impossible with it? Why does Open JDK keeps bug alive, inside there stable releases, but claiming that its clone of Oracle JDK (which is not really), then what really technically separates Open JDK from Oracle JDK?

@TITLE:C# PredicateBuilder Entities: The parameter 'f' was not bound in the specified LINQ to Entities query expression
@CONTENT:I needed to build a dynamic filter and I wanted to keep using entities. Because of this reason I wanted to use the PredicateBuilder from albahari. I created the following code: var invoerDatums = PredicateBuilder.True<OnderzoeksVragen>();
var inner = PredicateBuilder.False<OnderzoeksVragen>();

foreach (var filter in set.RapportInvoerFilter.ToList())
{
    if(filter.IsDate)
    {
        var date = DateTime.Parse(filter.Waarde);
        invoerDatums = invoerDatums.Or(o => o.Van >= date && o.Tot <= date);
    }
    else
    {
        string temp = filter.Waarde;
        inner = inner.Or(o => o.OnderzoekType == temp);
    }
}

invoerDatums = invoerDatums.And(inner);
var onderzoeksVragen = entities.OnderzoeksVragen
                               .AsExpandable()
                               .Where(invoerDatums)
                               .ToList();
 When I ran the code there was only 1 filter which wasn't a date filter. So only the inner predicate was filled. When the predicate was executed I got the following error. The parameter 'f' was not bound in the specified LINQ to Entities query expression. While searching for an answer I found the following page. But this is already implemented in the LINQKit. Does anyone else experienced this error and know how to solve it?

var inner = PredicateBuilder.False<OnderzoeksVragen>();

@TITLE:In a C# event handler, why must the ¡§sender¡¨ parameter be an object?
@CONTENT:According to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h0eyck3s(VS.71).aspx the sender parameter in a C# event handler "is always of type object, even if it is possible to use a more specific type." This leads to lots of event handling code like:- RepeaterItem item = sender as RepeaterItem
if (item != null) { /* Do some stuff */ }
 Now, in my case, I'm working with custom C# events (rather than built-in ASP.NET events, no ASP.NET at all involved so far), so I definitely don't have to worry about accidentally performing an operation on e.g. a GridView's Header. That said, why does the convention advise against declaring an event handler with a more specific type? :- MyType
{
  public event MyEventHander MyEvent;
}

...

delegate void MyEventHander ( MyType sender, MyEventArgs e );
 Am I missing a gotcha? Edit Just trying something on for size, it occurs to me that you could expand on EventHandler<TArgs> with:- public class EventArgs<TContent> : EventArgs
{
  public TContent Content { get; set; }
}

public delegate void EventHandler<TContent>
  ( object sender, EventArgs<TContent> e );
 Does that look smelly? Edit 2 Before I accept an answer, I should say for posterity that I agree with the general sentiment in the answers the convention is to use object even when it is possible to use a more specific type, and in real-world programming it is important to follow the convention. Thanks for your answers!
@CODE:RepeaterItem item = sender as RepeaterItem
if (item != null) { /* Do some stuff */ } MyType

@TITLE:What can make C++ RTTI undesirable?
@CONTENT:Looking at the LLVM documentation, they mention that they use "a custom form of RTTI", and this is the reason they have isa<>, cast<> and dyn_cast<> templated functions. Usually, reading that a library reimplements some basic functionality of a language is a terrible code smell and just invites to run. However, this is LLVM we're talking of: the guys are working on a C++ compiler and a C++ runtime. If they don't know what they're doing, I'm pretty much screwed because I prefer clang to the gcc version that ships with Mac OS. Still, being less experimented than them, I'm left wondering what are the pitfalls of the normal RTTI. I know that it works only for types that have a v-table, but that only raises two questions: Since you just need a virtual method to have a vtable, why don't they just mark a method as virtual? Virtual destructors seem to be good at this. If their solution doesn't use regular RTTI, any idea how it was implemented?

@TITLE:IOS 7 - css - html height - 100% = 692px
@CONTENT:I have a weird bug on iPad iOS7 landscape mode. What i was able to investigate is that in iOS7 window.outerHeight is 692px and window.innerHeight 672px; while in previous versions both values are 672px. Even though my <html> and <body> tags have height 100% there seems to be space for scrolling, and the weird thing is that this problem only shows up on landscpae You can see what i am talking about by visiting t.cincodias.com, for example, in a iOS 7 iPad the footer bar (or the header sometimes) will be cut. But on previous iOS versions the content displays fine at fullscreen. Even when i set the height of both tags to height: 672px !important and position:absolute; bottom: 0;, you can still scroll the content vertically by touching an iframe (the ads are iframes). I'm running the release candidate version of iOS7 thanks for any help.

@CONTENT:I am running Xcode 4.2 on OS X 10.6.8. Due to corporate policy, I have two Apple ID's. me@bigcorp.com is my "work" ID, and that's the ID that is connected to my iOS Developer Program membership. I also have me@personalmail.com, my "personal" ID, which is associated with my music, Angry Birds download, and so on. I'm trying to install the iOS 4.3 Simulator from within Xcode (Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads -> Components). When I click the "install" button next to that component, Xcode complains that me@personalmail.com is not a "Registered Apple Developer". I'd like to have it use me@bigcorp.com, but I can't find any reference anywhere that describes how to change it, within Xcode or otherwise. Can anyone explain how to beat Xcode into submission?

@CONTENT:In python, I have to instantiate certain class, knowing its name in a string, but this class 'lives' in a dynamically imported module. An example follows: loader-class script: import sys
class loader:
  def __init__(self, module_name, class_name): # both args are strings
    try:
      __import__(module_name)
      modul = sys.modules[module_name]

    except ImportError:
       # manage import error
 some-dinamycally-loaded-module script: class myName:
  # etc...
 I use this arrangement to make any dynamically-loaded-module to be used by the loader-class following certain predefined behaviours in the dyn-loaded-modules... Any ideas are appreciated Thanks!

@TITLE:Command Line Password Prompt in PHP
@CONTENT:I'm writing a command line tool to help my web app. It needs a password to connect to the service. I'd like the script to show a password prompt so I don't have to pass it as a command line argument. That's easy enough, but I'd like it to not echo the password to the screen as it's typed. How can I do this with PHP? Bonus points for doing it in pure PHP (no system('stty')) and replacing the characters with *. EDIT: The script will run on a unix like system (linux or mac). The script is written in PHP, and will most likely stay like that. Also, for the record, the stty way of doing it is: echo "Password: ";
system('stty -echo');
$password = trim(fgets(STDIN));
system('stty echo');
// add a new line since the users CR didn't echo
echo "\n";
 I'd prefer to not have the system() calls in there.
@CODE:system('stty') * stty echo "Password: ";
system('stty -echo');
$password = trim(fgets(STDIN));

@LINK:/questions/2799571/in-ruby-how-does-coerce-actually-work
@TITLE:In Ruby, how does coerce() actually work?
@CONTENT:It is said that when we have a class Point and knows how to perform point * 3 like the following: class Point
  def initialize(x,y)
    @x, @y = x, y
  end

  def *(c)
    Point.new(@x * c, @y * c)
  end
end

point = Point.new(1,2)
p point
p point * 3
 Output: #<Point:0x336094 @x=1, @y=2>
#<Point:0x335fa4 @x=3, @y=6>
 but then, 3 * point
 is not understood: Point can't be coerced into Fixnum (TypeError) So we need to further define an instance method coerce: class Point
  def coerce(something)
    [self, something]
  end
end

p 3 * point
 Output: #<Point:0x3c45a88 @x=3, @y=6>
 So it is said that 3 * point is the same as 3.*(point). That is, the instance method * takes an argument point and invoke on the object 3. Now, since this method * doesn't know how to multiply a point, so point.coerce(3)
 will be called, and get back an array: [point, 3]
 and then * is once again applied to it, is that true? Now, this is understood and we now have a new Point object, as performed by the instance method * of the Point class. The question is: Who invokes point.coerce(3)? Is it Ruby automatically, or is it some code inside of * method of Fixnum by catching an exception? Or is it by case statement that when it doesn't know one of the known types, then call coerce? Does coerce always need to return an array of 2 elements? Can it be no array? Or can it be an array of 3 elements? And is the rule that, the original operator (or method) * will then be invoked on element 0, with the argument of element 1? (Element 0 and element 1 are the two elements in that array returned by coerce.) Who does it? Is it done by Ruby or is it done by code in Fixnum? If it is done by code in Fixnum, then it is a "convention" that everybody follows when doing a coercion? So could it be the code in * of Fixnum doing something like this: class Fixnum
  def *(something)
    if (something.is_a? ...)
    else if ...  # other type / class
    else if ...  # other type / class
    else
    # it is not a type / class I know
      array = something.coerce(self)
      return array[0].*(array[1])   # or just return array[0] * array[1]
    end
  end
end
 So it is really hard to add something to Fixnum's instance method coerce? It already has a lot of code in it and we can't just add a few lines to enhance it (but will we ever want to?) The coerce in the Point class is quite generic and it works with * or + because they are transitive. What if it is not transitive, such as if we define Point minus Fixnum to be: point = Point.new(100,100)
point - 20  #=> (80,80)
20 - point  #=> (-80,-80)
@CODE:Point point * 3 class Point
  def initialize(x,y)
    @x, @y = x, y
  end

  def *(c)
    Point.new(@x * c, @y * c)
  end
end

point = Point.new(1,2)
p point
p point * 3 #<Point:0x336094 @x=1, @y=2>
#<Point:0x335fa4 @x=3, @y=6> 3 * point Point Fixnum TypeError coerce class Point
  def coerce(something)
    [self, something]
  end
end

p 3 * point #<Point:0x3c45a88 @x=3, @y=6> 3 * point 3.*(point) * point 3 * point.coerce(3) [point, 3] * Point * Point point.coerce(3) * Fixnum case coerce coerce * coerce Fixnum Fixnum * Fixnum class Fixnum
  def *(something)
    if (something.is_a? ...)
    else if ...  # other type / class
    else if ...  # other type / class
    else
    # it is not a type / class I know
      array = something.coerce(self)
      return array[0].*(array[1])   # or just return array[0] * array[1]
    end
  end
end Fixnum coerce coerce Point * + point = Point.new(100,100)
point - 20  #=> (80,80)
20 - point  #=> (-80,-80)

@TITLE:Eclipse/Maven: JUnit tests not compiled when running them
@CONTENT:I am working on a project using Maven and Eclipse (m2eclipse plugin). I've got problems with the JUnit tests: Sometimes, when running them within Eclipse, they wont be compiled, but the old class files are used instead. When I delete the class files, I get ClassNotFoundExceptions in Eclipse. I then have to manually recompile them by using mvn test-compile or other goals. I also noticed that the class files of the tests sometimes are put into the classes subdirectory instead of test-classes. I really can't figure out what is wrong. The JUnit java files are within src/main/java and are correctly named (*Test.java). Do I have to compile and run them always via Maven? Why doesn't Eclipse compile the files when I want to run them? (Interestingly, sometimes it does. Sometimes everything works perfectly.)

@LINK:/questions/867114/why-no-reference-counting-garbage-collection-in-c
@TITLE:Why no Reference Counting + Garbage Collection in C#?
@CONTENT:I come from a C++ background and I've been working with C# for about a year. Like many others I'm flummoxed as to why deterministic resource management is not built-in to the language. Instead of deterministic destructors we have the dispose pattern. People start to wonder whether spreading the IDisposable cancer through their code is worth the effort. In my C++-biased brain it seems like using reference-counted smart pointers with deterministic destructors is a major step up from a garbage collector that requires you to implement IDisposable and call dispose to clean up your non-memory resources. Admittedly, I'm not very smart... so I'm asking this purely from a desire to better understand why things are the way they are. What if C# were modified such that: Objects are reference counted. When an object's reference count goes to zero, a resource cleanup method is called deterministically on the object, then the object is marked for garbage collection. Garbage collection occurs at some non-deterministic time in the future at which point memory is reclaimed. In this scenario you don't have to implement IDisposable or remember to call Dispose. You just implement the resource cleanup function if you have non-memory resources to release. Why is that a bad idea? Would that defeat the purpose of the garbage collector? Would it be feasible to implement such a thing? EDIT: From the comments so far, this is a bad idea because GC is faster without reference counting problem of dealing with cycles in the object graph I think number one is valid, but number two is easy to deal with using weak references. So does the speed optimization outweigh the cons that you: may not free a non-memory resource in a timely manner might free a non-memory resource too soon If your resource cleanup mechanism is deterministic and built-in to the language you can eliminate those possibilities.

@TITLE:JavaScript equivalent of jQuery's extend method
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: How can I merge properties of two JavaScript objects dynamically? Background I have a function that takes a config object as an argument. Within the function, I also have default object. Each of those objects contains properties that essentially work as settings for the rest of the code within the function. In order to prevent having to specify all of the settings within the config object, I use jQuery's extend method to fill in a new object, settings with any default values from the default object if they weren't specified in the config object: var config = {key1: value1};
var default = {key1: default1, key2: default2, key 3: default 3};

var settings = $.extend(default, config);

//resulting properties of settings:
settings = {key1: value1, key2: default2, key 3: default 3};
 Problem This works great, but I'd like to reproduce this functionality without the need for jQuery. Is there an equally elegant (or close to) means to do this with plain ol' javascript? Edit: Non-Duplicate Justification This question is not a duplicate of the "How can I merge properties of two JavaScript objects dynamically?" question. Whereas that question simply wants to create an object that contains all of the keys and values from two separate objects - I specifically want to address how to do this in the event that both objects share some but not all keys and which object will get precedence (the default) for the resulting object in the event that there are duplicate keys. And even more specifically, I wanted to address the use of jQuery's method to achieve this and find an alternative way to do so without jQuery. While many of the answers to both questions overlap, that does not mean that the questions themselves are the same.
@CODE:config default config extend settings default config var config = {key1: value1};
var default = {key1: default1, key2: default2, key 3: default 3};

var settings = $.extend(default, config);

@CONTENT:I am in the early stages of creating an app where I would like to save, sync and backup data. The app will not store any files just data in a database. It is going to be iOS 8 and up so I am able to use CloudKit. I did some research and still not clear on how Core Data, iCloud and CloudKit work together. As far as understand CloudKit is just a way of getting and retrieving data to/from the cloud. Is CloudKit just a different way of syncing data with iCloud? My questions are: If I do use CloudKit, do I still need to create local core data database? If yes will it be automatically synced with iCloud or I would have to call methods to store to both places? If the data is only stored in the cloud will user be able to access it when iOS device is not connected to the internet. I read that CloudKit will have only limited caching. How will that work if iCloud account is not enabled. If someone can kind of break down what each technology does in the process of saving and syncing core data database offline and online. My current understanding is: Core Data is used to store data locally iCould syncs the data and stores in the cloud CloudKit gives the ability to store and manage data in the cloud??

 I think that I do not have command line tools, so I tried to download some. It found out that there is no usual link for this in my XCode (it is 4, not 5, dont know why. If there is some way of installing fifth xcode - please help). So I went to apple developers webpage and not found command line tools for 10.9. I tried for 10.8 - it prints "Try install for 10.7", after trying with tools for 10.7 - it prints "try for 10.8". Please, help. I'll provide all info for help.

@TITLE:How do SQL EXISTS statements work?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn SQL and am having a hard time understanding EXISTS statements. I came across this quote about "exists" and don't understand something: Using the exists operator, your subquery can return zero, one, or many rows, and the condition simply checks whether the subquery returned any rows. If you look at the select clause of the subquery, you will see that it consists of a single literal (1); since the condition in the containing query only needs to know how many rows have been returned, the actual data the subquery returned is irrelevant. What I don't understand is how does the outer query know which row the subquery is checking? For example: SELECT *
  FROM suppliers
 WHERE EXISTS (select *
                 from orders
                where suppliers.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id);
 I understand that if the id from the supplier and orders table match, the subquery will return true and all the columns from the matching row in the suppliers' table will be outputted. What I don't get is how the subquery communicates which specific row (lets say the row with supplier id 25) should be printed if only a true or false is being returned. It appears to me that there is no relationship between the outer query and the subquery.
@CODE:SELECT *
  FROM suppliers
 WHERE EXISTS (select *
                 from orders
                where suppliers.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id);

@CONTENT:What is the correct way to split Spring's configuration to multiple xml files? At the moment I have /WEB-INF/foo-servlet.xml /WEB-INF/foo-service.xml /WEB-INF/foo-persistence.xml My web.xml has the following: <servlet>
    <description>Spring MVC Dispatcher Servlet</description>
    <servlet-name>intrafest</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
        org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
    </servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>
            /WEB-INF/foo-*.xml
        </param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>2</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<context-param>
    <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
    <param-value>
            /WEB-INF/foo-*.xml

</context-param>


<listener>
    <listener-class>
        org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener
    </listener-class>
</listener>
 The actual questions: Is this approach correct/best? Do I really need to specify the config locations both in the DispatcherServlet AND the context-param sections? What do I need to keep in mind to be able to reference beans defined in foo-servlet.xml from foo-service.xml? Does this have something to do with specifying contextConfigLocation in web.xml? Update 1: I'm using Spring framework 3.0. It's my understanding that I don't need to do resource importing like this:  <import resource="foo-services.xml"/> 
 Is this a correct assumption?

@TITLE:Finding property differences between two C# objects
@CONTENT:The project I'm working on needs some simple audit logging for when a user changes their email, billing address, etc. The objects we're working with are coming from different sources, one a WCF service, the other a web service. I've implemented the following method using reflection to find changes to the properties on two different objects. This generates a list of the properties that have differences along with their old and new values. public static IList GenerateAuditLogMessages(T originalObject, T changedObject)
{
    IList list = new List();
    string className = string.Concat("[", originalObject.GetType().Name, "] ");

    foreach (PropertyInfo property in originalObject.GetType().GetProperties())
    {
        Type comparable =
            property.PropertyType.GetInterface("System.IComparable");

        if (comparable != null)
        {
            string originalPropertyValue =
                property.GetValue(originalObject, null) as string;
            string newPropertyValue =
                property.GetValue(changedObject, null) as string;

            if (originalPropertyValue != newPropertyValue)
            {
                list.Add(string.Concat(className, property.Name,
                    " changed from '", originalPropertyValue,
                    "' to '", newPropertyValue, "'"));
            }
        }
    }

    return list;
} I'm looking for System.IComparable because "All numeric types (such as Int32 and Double) implement IComparable, as do String, Char, and DateTime." This seemed the best way to find any property that's not a custom class. Tapping into the PropertyChanged event that's generated by the WCF or web service proxy code sounded good but doesn't give me enough info for my audit logs (old and new values). Looking for input as to if there is a better way to do this, thanks! @Aaronaught, here is some example code that is generating a positive match based on doing object.Equals: Address address1 = new Address();
address1.StateProvince = new StateProvince();

Address address2 = new Address();
address2.StateProvince = new StateProvince();

IList list = Utility.GenerateAuditLogMessages(address1, address2); "[Address] StateProvince changed from 'MyAccountService.StateProvince' to 'MyAccountService.StateProvince'" It's two different instances of the StateProvince class, but the values of the properties are the same (all null in this case). We're not overriding the equals method.
@CODE:public static IList GenerateAuditLogMessages(T originalObject, T changedObject)
{
    IList list = new List();
    string className = string.Concat("[", originalObject.GetType().Name, "] ");

    foreach (PropertyInfo property in originalObject.GetType().GetProperties())
    {
        Type comparable =
            property.PropertyType.GetInterface("System.IComparable");

        if (comparable != null)
        {

                property.GetValue(originalObject, null) as string;
            string newPropertyValue =
                property.GetValue(changedObject, null) as string;

            if (originalPropertyValue != newPropertyValue)
            {
                list.Add(string.Concat(className, property.Name,
                    " changed from '", originalPropertyValue,
                    "' to '", newPropertyValue, "'"));
            }
        }
    }

    return list;
} Address address1 = new Address();
address1.StateProvince = new StateProvince();

Address address2 = new Address();
address2.StateProvince = new StateProvince();

@TITLE:Where would you use a friend function vs. a static member function?
@CONTENT:We make a non-member function a friend of a class when we want it to access that class's private members. This gives it the same access rights as a static member function would have. Both alternatives would give you a function that is not associated with any instance of that class. When must we use a friend function? When must we use a static function? If both are viable options to solve a problem, how do we weigh up their suitability? Is there one that should be preferred by default? For example, when implementing a factory that creates instances of class foo which only has a private constructor, should that factory function be a static member of foo (you would call foo::create()) or should it be a friend function (you would call create_foo())?

@TITLE:Examples of Applicative Functor usage in Scala
@CONTENT:I know that Monad can be expressed in Scala as follows: trait Monad[F[_]] {
  def flatMap[A, B](f: A => F[B]): F[A] => F[B]
}
 I see why it is useful. For example, given two functions: getUserById(userId: Int): Option[User] = ...
getPhone(user: User): Option[Phone] = ...
 I can easily write function getPhoneByUserId(userId: Int) since Option is a monad: def getPhoneByUserId(userId: Int): Option[Phone] = 
  getUserById(userId).flatMap(user => getPhone(user))
 ... Now I see Applicative Functor in Scala: trait Applicative[F[_]] {
  def apply[A, B](f: F[A => B]): F[A] => F[B]
}
 I wonder when I should use it instead of monad . I guess both Option and List are Applicatives. Could you give simple examples of using apply with Option and List and explain why I should use it instead of flatMap ?

@TITLE:Android - Wake Up and Unlock Device
@CONTENT:Application description: The application is intended as a safety program for a specific client (not to be deployed publicly). When the application has not detected movement for a certain period of time, the application should sound an alarm and bring itself to the foreground if it is in the background or the device is asleep. The problem: In the event the device is asleep and locked, we need to wake up and unlock the device. Using various techniques found here on SO and other places, we've been able to (partially) wake and unlock the device, however this ONLY behaves properly when the device is physically plugged in to a computer. If the device is sitting by itself unplugged, and we test the wake-unlock, nothing happens; the device seems to remain asleep, and the application seems to do nothing at all (no alarm). I have used this post about using PowerManager and KeyguardManager, and this post using window flags. Here is the code presently used to wake the device: public void wakeDevice() {
    PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
    wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock((PowerManager.SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK | PowerManager.FULL_WAKE_LOCK | PowerManager.ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP), "TAG");
    wakeLock.acquire();

    KeyguardManager keyguardManager = (KeyguardManager) getSystemService(Context.KEYGUARD_SERVICE);
    KeyguardLock keyguardLock = keyguardManager.newKeyguardLock("TAG");
    keyguardLock.disableKeyguard();
    runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){
        public void run(){
            getWindow().addFlags(
                      WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED
                    | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON
                    | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON
                    | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD);                
        }
    });
}
 From the comments and posts on some of the other SO questions I've seen / used, it seems as though the PowerManager / KeyguardManager code should have done the trick. Again, as I said before, it does technically work while the device is plugged in via USB to the dev machine, but does absolutely nothing while the device is separated. Also note this is our first Android application, and so are fully aware we might be completely off on what we are trying to do. Any suggestions are welcome. So in short, given the code above, why does the device behave so differently based on whether it is plugged in, and what should we change in order to wake and unlock the device as described? Thank you in advance for your assistance!
@CODE:public void wakeDevice() {
    PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
    wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock((PowerManager.SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK | PowerManager.FULL_WAKE_LOCK | PowerManager.ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP), "TAG");
    wakeLock.acquire();

    KeyguardManager keyguardManager = (KeyguardManager) getSystemService(Context.KEYGUARD_SERVICE);
    KeyguardLock keyguardLock = keyguardManager.newKeyguardLock("TAG");
    keyguardLock.disableKeyguard();
    runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){
        public void run(){
            getWindow().addFlags(
                      WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED
                    | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON
                    | WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON

@TITLE:Why are Exceptions said to be so bad for Input Validation?
@CONTENT:I understand that "Exceptions are for exceptional cases" [a], but besides just being repeated over and over again, I've never found an actual reason for this fact. Being that they halt execution, it makes sense that you wouldn't want them for plain conditional logic, but why not input validation? Say you were to loop through a group of inputs and catch each exception to group them together for user notification... I continually see that this is somehow "wrong" because users enter incorrect input all the time, but that point seems to be based on semantics. The input is Not what was expected and hence is exceptional. Throwing an exception allows me to define exactly what was wrong like StringValueTooLong or or IntegerValueTooLow or InvalidDateValue or whatever. Why is this considered wrong? Alternatives to throwing an exception would be to either return (and eventually collect) an error code or far worse an error string. Then I would either show those error strings directly, or parse the error codes and then show corresponding error messages to the user. Wouldn't a exception be considered a malleable error code? Why create a separate table of error codes and messages, when these could be generalized with the exception functionality already built into my language? Also, I found this article by Martin Fowler as to how to handle such things - the Notification pattern. I'm not sure how I see this as being anything other than Exceptions that don't halt execution. a: Everywhere I've read anything about Exceptions. --- Edit --- Many great points have been made. I've commented on most and +'d the good points, but I'm not yet completely convinced. I don't mean to advocate Exceptions as the proper means to resolve Input Validation, but I would like to find good reasons why the practice is considered so evil when it seems most alternate solutions are just Exceptions in disguise.

@LINK:/questions/519309/how-do-i-read-utf-8-with-diamond-operator
@TITLE:How do I read UTF-8 with diamond operator (<>)?
@CONTENT:I want to read UTF-8 input in Perl, no matter if it comes from the standard input or from a file, using the diamond operator: while(<>){...}. So my script should be callable in these two ways, as usual, giving the same output: ./script.pl utf8.txt
cat utf8.txt | ./script.pl
 But the outputs differ! Only the second call (using cat) seems to work as designed, reading UTF-8 properly. Here is the script: #!/usr/bin/perl -w

binmode STDIN, ':utf8';
binmode STDOUT, ':utf8';

while(<>){
    my @chars = split //, $_;
    print "$_\n" foreach(@chars);
}
 How can I make it read UTF-8 correctly in both cases? I would like to keep using the diamond operator <> for reading, if possible. EDIT: I realized I should probably describe the different outputs. My input file contains this sequence: a\xCA\xA7b. The method with cat correctly outputs: a
\xCA\xA7
b
 But the other method gives me this: a
\xC3\x8A
\xC2\xA7
b
@CODE:while(<>){...} ./script.pl utf8.txt
cat utf8.txt | ./script.pl cat #!/usr/bin/perl -w

@LINK:/questions/894167/functional-programming-in-c-with-macro-higher-order-function-generators
@TITLE:Functional programming in C with macro ¡§Higher Order Function¡¨ generators
@CONTENT:Pay attention carefully because this is a hell of a question ;-) I want to use template functions for generic collection actions (like search, foreach, etc.) in C while maintaining compiler static type checking. It is fairly straightforward while you're using simple callbacks like in this example: #define MAKE_FOREACH(TYPE)\
void foreach_##TYPE (TYPE[n] array, int n, void(*f)(TYPE)) {\
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\
    f(array[i]);\
  }\
}
 so you can do things like: MAKE_FOREACH(int)
MAKE_FOREACH(float)

void intcallback(int x){
  printf("got %d\n", x);
}

void floatcallback(float x){
  printf("got %f\n", x);
}

int main(){
  int[5] iarray = {1,2,3,4,5};
  float[5] farray = {1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0};
  foreach_int(iarray, 5, intcallback);
  foreach_float(farray, 5, floatcallback);
}
 If I'd like to implement callbacks with return types, for example to make a "map" function, I could do: #define MAKE_MAP(TYPE, RTYPE)\
RTYPE* map_##TYPE (TYPE[n] array, int n, RTYPE(*f)(TYPE)) {\
  RTYPE* result = (RTYPE*)malloc(sizeof(RTYPE)*n);\
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\
    result[i]=f(array[i]);\
  }\
}
 So far, so good. The problem comes now, when I want my callback functions to accept any number of typed arguments. The idea is something like: #define MAKE_MAP(TYPE, RTYPE, ...)\
RTYPE* map_##TYPE (TYPE[n] array, int n, RTYPE(*f)(TYPE, __VA_ARGS__), __VA_ARGS__)
/*this would work for the declaration (because just the types would be enough)
but the  parameter names are missing :-s*/ \
{\
  RTYPE* result = (RTYPE*)malloc(sizeof(RTYPE)*n);\
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\
    result[i]=f(array[i], /*here the names of the parameters, in order*/);\
  }\
}
 so, as you can see, I could declare a map function as: MAKE_MAP(int, float, char)
 giving: float* map_int(int[n] array, int n, float(*f)(int, char), char);
 but I cannot figure how to implement the parameter passing with the preprocessor. Here is where I ask for your help, ideas and suggestions. (By the way, don't tell me to use a variadic function as template and passing a va_list argument to the callback, because all this stuff was because of the type checking :-p)
@CODE:#define MAKE_FOREACH(TYPE)\
void foreach_##TYPE (TYPE[n] array, int n, void(*f)(TYPE)) {\
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\
    f(array[i]);\
  }\
} MAKE_FOREACH(int)
MAKE_FOREACH(float)

void intcallback(int x){
  printf("got %d\n", x);
}

void floatcallback(float x){
  printf("got %f\n", x);
}

int main(){
  int[5] iarray = {1,2,3,4,5};
  float[5] farray = {1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0};
  foreach_int(iarray, 5, intcallback);
  foreach_float(farray, 5, floatcallback);
} #define MAKE_MAP(TYPE, RTYPE)\
RTYPE* map_##TYPE (TYPE[n] array, int n, RTYPE(*f)(TYPE)) {\
  RTYPE* result = (RTYPE*)malloc(sizeof(RTYPE)*n);\
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\
    result[i]=f(array[i]);\
  }\
} #define MAKE_MAP(TYPE, RTYPE, ...)\

@TITLE:Is there a way to circumvent Python list.append() becoming progressively slower in a loop as the list grows?
@CONTENT:I have a big file I'm reading from, and convert every few lines to an instance of an Object. Since I'm looping through the file, I stash the instance to a list using list.append(instance), and then continue looping. This is a file that's around ~100MB so it isn't too large, but as the list grows larger, the looping slows down progressively. (I print the time for each lap in the loop). This is not intrinsic to the loop ~ when I print every new instance as I loop through the file, the program progresses at constant speed ~ it is only when I append them to a list it gets slow. My friend suggested disabling garbage collection before the while loop and enabling it afterward & making a garbage collection call. Did anyone else observe a similar problem with list.append getting slower? Is there any other way to circumvent this? I'll try the following two things suggested below. (1) "pre-allocating" the memory ~ what's the best way to do this? (2) Try using deque Multiple posts (see comment by Alex Martelli) suggested memory fragmentation (he has a large amount of available memory like I do) ~ but no obvious fixes to performance for this. To replicate the phenomenon, please run the test code provided below in the answers and assume that the lists have useful data. gc.disable() and gc.enable() helps with the timing. I'll also do a careful analysis of where all the time is spent.

}
 I receive the output as. 1 1 1
1 2 2
1 2 3
 I am facing a problem in justifying this output. I made lot of boxes on a copy for easy grasp of the problem. I am able to justify the output 1 1 1, my trouble starts with the statement, *++*ptr. Since, a unary operators are executed from right to left. So, *ptr would be tackled first, then the value at ptr would be incremented. After this increment, I am not sure what happens, the book says that somehow p is also incremented to point to the next element in this array. The output 1 2 2 can only be achieved through the increment of p. I am not sure that this kind of question fits exactly on stackoverflow. I tried my best, wasted at least 10 pages with boxes drawn over them. Any clarification would be appreciated.

There might obviously be cases where such transformation is not possible, trivial being root A with child B to root B with child A etc.). In such cases, the algorithm would simply deliver an result "not possible". Even more spectacular version is a generalization for networks, i.e. when we assume that a node can occur multiple times in the tree (effectively having multiple "parents"), while cycles are forbidden. Disclaimer : This is not a homework, actually it comes from a real business problem and I found it quite interesting wondering if somebody might know a solution.

@TITLE:OpenGL live text-rendering
@CONTENT:I'm implementing a GUI built on top of OpenGL. I came to the problem that each GUI will have -- text rendering. I know of several methods of rendering text in OpenGL, however, I'm wonderin which of them would be best suited for a GUI. Generally in a GUI we have two types of text -- static and live. Static is easy enough -- we can render a TTF to a texture and forget about it. It's the "live" text that is more bothering me -- imagine console, or a live chat in a multi-player game. I thought of several options: no special cases -- render and load a texture each time the text changes, keeping in mind only to rerender it when actually new text appears, and trying to split the larger text into small parts (like per chat line). However this would still leave us hanging in cases like a score line that changes all the time, or a intro text that renders "per character" (typewriter style seen in some sci-fi games) quad-per character -- this also seems a popular solution, you prepare a texture with the ASCII table and render a textured quad character. However, I have serious doubts about the efficiency of such a solution. Tips how to make that faster would also be welcome. hybrid solutions -- however I have no idea how to implement that cleanly The question hence is -- how to render text in OpenGL efficiently? (if this helps, I'm coding in STL/Boost-heavy C++ and aiming at GForce 6 and later graphics cards) Any suggestions welcome.

@TITLE:Yahoo Weather API WOEID retrieval
@CONTENT:I'm creating an app (PHP) that takes yahoo weather data from the free RSS feed and correlates it with a colour hex based on data retrieved from the RSS feed. The issue I'm having is finding a way to grab the location code or WOEID without doing it manually. Yahoos API sends back an RSS feed as long as you provide a WOEID -> http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=4097 Is there an ethical way of doing this? My beginner knowledge tells me I have to write a script that would search yahoo using the term and grab the first WOEID, but I would assume yahoo doesn't want scripts doing this and it seems overcomplicated... If not, are there any alternative APIs that would make this easier on me? Thanks!

Some time ago there was zero code coverage by unit-tests but now we're trying to write all new code in T.D.D. manner and lowering technical debt by covering "old" code by unit-tests as well(test-last technique). Business logic's complexity is quite high and sometimes no one can answer whether some methods are used or not. How this dead code methods can be found? Extensive logging? Higher test coverage?(It is not very easy because customers want new features to come out)

@TITLE:google maps v3 standard icon/shadow names (equiv. of G_DEFAULT_ICON in v2)
@CONTENT:I'm switching icon types of google maps markers between a default one and another one (made by google chart api). To switch back to standard icon I use: marker.setIcon('http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/marker.png');
 For another icon I use: marker.setIcon('http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/marker_yellow.png');
 The question is: is the URL I use really the "standard" (canonical)? Is it assured that google will not change it? it would be better to use some constant like G_DEFAULT_ICON in gmaps api v2. Is there anything similar in api v3? if not, where one can find the list of canonical icon/shadow URLs that are assured to work during all the google api v3 life? The same question for shadows - when I set the icon, how to get the standard shadow instead of using ugly m.setShadow(new google.maps.MarkerImage('http://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/shadow50.png', null, null, new google.maps.Point(10, 34)))? (Note that getShadow() will not tell you anything as it returns null on the default icon with defaultshadow). PS: there are some dynamic icons APIs but they all are now deprecated, and no remedy has been found.
@CODE:marker.setIcon('http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/marker.png'); marker.setIcon('http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/marker_yellow.png'); G_DEFAULT_ICON m.setShadow(new google.maps.MarkerImage('http://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/shadow50.png', null, null, new google.maps.Point(10, 34))) getShadow() null

I basicly want the data in sessions to be deleted when a user is completely deleted This since the sessions will only be deleted when the expiration is detected by my session manager...

@CONTENT:When using Google Maps Android API V2 I'm following the Google Play Services setup documentation to make a check to ensure that Google Play Services are installed, using the following code in my main Activity: @Override
public void onResume()

      checkGooglePlayServicesAvailability();

      super.onResume();
}

  }
 This works fine. However, I noticed some of the older Android phones I have laying around (mostly running 2.2) were missing both GooglePlayServices as well as the Google Maps app itself. LogCat will report this error: Google Maps Android API: Google Maps application is missing. Question - how can I perform a similar check to the one above for the availability of Google Maps on a device? Secondly, if the user already has Google Maps installed I think the check will need to make sure their installed version is compatible with V2 of the Android Maps API. Update Here is my setupMapIfNeeded() method which is called at the end of onCreate(). This is where I think I'd want to determine if Google Maps is installed and alert the user, see the else block: private void setUpMapIfNeeded()

All of the documentation that comes with the various products - i.e. WiX, InstallAware, Wise, InstallShield etc expect that you understand these underlying concepts [which I just don't get] in order to follow what they're talking about. Can anyone point me in the direction of documentation that explains the concepts of software installers so that the software documentation actually makes sense?

@TITLE:Google Maps Android API V2 check if GoogleMaps are installed on device
@CONTENT:When using Google Maps Android API V2 I'm following the Google Play Services setup documentation to make a check to ensure that Google Play Services are installed, using the following code in my main Activity: @Override
public void onResume()
{
      checkGooglePlayServicesAvailability();

      super.onResume();
}

public void checkGooglePlayServicesAvailability()
  {
      int resultCode = GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(this);
      if(resultCode != ConnectionResult.SUCCESS)
      {
          Dialog dialog = GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog(resultCode, this, 69);
          dialog.setCancelable(false);
          dialog.setOnDismissListener(getOnDismissListener());
          dialog.show();
      }

      Log.d("GooglePlayServicesUtil Check", "Result is: " + resultCode);
  }
 This works fine. However, I noticed some of the older Android phones I have laying around (mostly running 2.2) were missing both GooglePlayServices as well as the Google Maps app itself. LogCat will report this error: Google Maps Android API: Google Maps application is missing. Question - how can I perform a similar check to the one above for the availability of Google Maps on a device? Secondly, if the user already has Google Maps installed I think the check will need to make sure their installed version is compatible with V2 of the Android Maps API. Update Here is my setupMapIfNeeded() method which is called at the end of onCreate(). This is where I think I'd want to determine if Google Maps is installed and alert the user, see the else block: private void setUpMapIfNeeded() 
{
    // Do a null check to confirm that we have not already instantiated the map.
    if (mMap == null) 
    {
        // Try to obtain the map from the SupportMapFragment.
        mMap = ((SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.basicMap)).getMap();

        if (mMap != null) 
        {

            mMap.moveCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoom(new LatLng(44.9800, -93.2636), 10.0f));
            setUpMap();
        }
        else
        {
            //THIS CODE NEVER EXECUTES - mMap is non-null even when Google Maps are not installed

I'll try to explain it as much as possible, and if it still isn't clear, I'll try to upload a video of the problem. Problem happens when trying to open the drawer and only when opening, and only happens sometimes, not always. That is when I start to open it it glitches and freezes with about 4 millimeters open, and always the same distance. It then would not continue opening nor close back if I move my finger back, when I let go, it closes. Please note: I have tried it on multiple devices (Nexus 7, Nexus) and virtual devices as well, problem persists. Issue replicated using the example provided by Google. (Youtube Link) Issue presented with my app. (Youtube Link) I managed to replicated the issue once but only once in Gmail app (which I believe uses the same implementation), however much more frequent with my app and the sample app. I noticed that the glitch happens at the same distance of which the drawer opens if you just click the edge of the screen, as in it freezes after initial open and never drags. Any pointers would be appreciated.

@CONTENT:What I'm doing seems like it should be simple, but I'm still lost after I've read every possible Stackoverflow answer I can find and Googled every article I can find. I'm using a preview SurfaceView and capturing an image from an activity that is set for screenOrientation="landscape" in my AndroidManifest.xml. I followed the sample Camera app code and thought things were working until I tried my app on a few Motorola devices running 1.5. I have the OrientationEventListener running OK and I use reflection to see if set the rotation as such: final int latchedOrientation = roundOrientation(mLastOrientation + 90);

Parameters parameters = preview.camera.getParameters();

JPLog.d("Setting camera rotation = %d", latchedOrientation);
try {
    // if >= 2.0
    Method method = Camera.Parameters.class.getMethod("setRotation",
        int.class);

    if(method != null) {
        method.invoke(parameters, latchedOrientation);
    }

} catch(Throwable t) {
    // if < 2.0
    parameters.set("rotation", latchedOrientation);
}

preview.camera.setParameters(parameters);
 NexusOne (OS 2.2) - Works great. latchedOrientation = 0, picture OK without any rotation in the EXIF header. T-Mobile G1 (OS 1.6) - Also works great. latchedOrientation = 0, picture OK. Motorola Backflip (OS 1.5) - Image rotated. latchedOrientation = 0, picture has no EXIF rotation in it. Motorola CLIQ (OS 1.5) - Image rotated. latchedOrientation = 0, picture has no EXIF rotation in it. What's going on with these Motorola devices? I thought my problem was the Motorola camera driver wasn't rotating the images, so found the Sanselan EXIF reading classes for Android and was preparing to rotate them myself. Funny thing is, there is EXIF headers but no rotation element. If I set the rotation manually to 90 degrees, the images come out perfect the Motorola devices, but now the G1 and the NexusOne have images that are rotated 90 degrees (not what I want). There has to be something I'm not getting here. I'm doubting this is a 1.5 issue, or else someone would've posted info on it?

@TITLE:Audio stream buffering
@CONTENT:I need to play live audio stream, actually it is radio. The problem is that I also need to manage 20 minute buffer for stream. As far as I understand it's not easy to implement with adnroid. First I checked MediaPlayer, but it doesn't provide any methods for buffer managment. In fact you even can't set buffer size directly. Secondly I tried to manage buffer using local files: progressively download the stream to a temporary files and switch them. But when you want to switch to following file (change datasource in MediaPlayer), audio is not played continuously. You can hear short interruptions. The last idea is to use stream proxy. Usually it is used for playing streams in Adnroid versions below 8. In stream proxy you create ServerSocket, read from audio stream and write to player. So actually I can manage buffering there. I can cache stream and write to MediaPlayer whatever I want. But. It doesn't work with Android 8. I got exception: Connection reset by peer java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer. MediaPlayer 8 doesn't want to read data from socket. Thus I have two questions: 1) What other way to implement stream buffering? 2) how to adapt StreamProxy for android 8? Any ideas are appreciated.

@TITLE:Android ADB commands to get the device properties
@CONTENT:I am trying to get the device properties from ADB commands. I can how ever get those values by running sample android application. How ever I wish to get using adb shell command itself to make my life easier. Here is the way I will get through sample application but I want corresponding adb commands for device manufacturer device hardware device model Os version(integer value) Kernel version * Please note my device is not rooted and I have no idea of rooting the device to get these values :-) * ## Code snippet
import android.os.Build;
manufacturer = Build.MANUFACTURER;
hardware = Build.HARDWARE;
model = Build.MODEL;
oSVersion = Build.VERSION.SDK_INT;
kernelVersion = System.getProperty("os.version");
 However I can able to get the os version. But then I want SDK version in integer. I want 18 in place of 4.2.2 C:\>adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release
4.2.2
@CODE:## Code snippet
import android.os.Build;
manufacturer = Build.MANUFACTURER;
hardware = Build.HARDWARE;
model = Build.MODEL;
oSVersion = Build.VERSION.SDK_INT;
kernelVersion = System.getProperty("os.version"); C:\>adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release
4.2.2

@TITLE:Create a node.js native extension on Windows
@CONTENT:I'm trying to access a particular native Windows API call from within a node.js application. I believe that the best way to do this is to create a native extension / addon to node that I can require in my node.js application and call from the JavaScript. Where can I find resources on how to actually compile this sort of executable? I can find instructions on how to write it, but all the build instructions seem to be for Linux. I'm fine with compiling through g++ on mingw, I don't need to use Visual Studio. Also, where do I find the header files that I need in order to compile the extension?

@TITLE:SecCertificateRef: How to get the certificate information?
@CONTENT:I have a certificate (SecCertificateRef), I can check if it's valid and I can extract a "summary" using SecCertificateCopySubjectSummary. What is the "summary" exactly? I don't understand the term "A string that contains a human-readable summary of the contents of the certificate." in the Apple documentation. I think, they mean the "CN" in the certificate, correct? Is there any method to get the clear X509-information out of SecCertificateRef? Does a cast to a keychain-object help? I want to have something like this and I am especially focussed on the "CN" to compare it with the URL I submitted to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. (Or any better ideas?) That is what I want to have: Version: 3 (0x2)

@TITLE:Stream live video from phone to phone using socket fd
@CONTENT:I am new to android programming and have found myself stuck I have been researching various ways to stream live video from phone to phone and seem to have it mostly functional, except of course the most important part: playing the stream. It appears to be sending the stream from one phone, but the second phone is not able to play the stream. Here is the code for the playing side public class VideoPlayback extends Activity implements Callback {
MediaPlayer mp;
private SurfaceView mPreview;

    holder.addCallback(this);

@LINK:/questions/3669883/hibernate-where-do-insertable-false-updatable-false-belong-in-composite-pr
@TITLE:Hibernate: Where do insertable = false, updatable = false belong in composite primary key constellations involving foreign keys?
@CONTENT:When implementing composite primary keys in Hibernate or other ORMs there are up to three places where to put the insertable = false, updatable = false in composite primary key constellations that use identifying relationships (FKs that are part of the PK): Into the composite PK class' @Column annotation (@Embeddable classes only) or Into the entity class' association @JoinColumn/s annotation or Into the entity class' redundant PK property's @Column annotation (@IdClass classes only) The third is the only way to do with @IdClass and JPA 1.0 AFAIK. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Identity_and_Sequencing#Primary_Keys_through_OneToOne_Relationships. I will consider only cases 1. and 2. Q: Which way is the preferred place to put the "insertable = false, updatable = false" to generally? I have experienced problems with Hibernate concerning this question. For example, Hibernate 3.5.x will complain about the Zips table CREATE TABLE Zips
(
  country_code CHAR(2),
  code VARCHAR(10),
  PRIMARY KEY (country_code, code),
  FOREIGN KEY (country_code) REFERENCES Countries (iso_code)
)
 with: org.hibernate.MappingException: Repeated column in mapping for entity: com.kawoolutions.bbstats.model.Zip column: country_code (should be mapped with insert="false" update="false")
org.hibernate.mapping.PersistentClass.checkColumnDuplication(PersistentClass.java:676)
org.hibernate.mapping.PersistentClass.checkPropertyColumnDuplication(PersistentClass.java:698)
...
 As you can see the country_code column is both PK and FK. Here are its classes: Entity class: @Entity
@Table(name = "Zips")
public class Zip implements Serializable
{
    @EmbeddedId
    private ZipId id;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "country_code", referencedColumnName = "iso_code")
    private Country country = null;
...
}
 Composite PK class: @Embeddable
public class ZipId implements Serializable
{
    @Column(name = "country_code", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private String countryCode;

    @Column(name = "code")
    private String code;
...
}
 When putting the insertable = false, updatable = false into the entity class association's @JoinColumn all exceptions disappear and everything work fine. However, I don't see why the above code should not be working. It might be Hibernate having problems with this. Is the described a Hibernate bug, as it doesn't seem to evaluate @Column "insertable = false, updatable = false"? In essence, what's the standard JPA way, the best practice, or preference where to put "insertable = false, updatable = false"?
@CODE:CREATE TABLE Zips
(
  country_code CHAR(2),
  code VARCHAR(10),
  PRIMARY KEY (country_code, code),
  FOREIGN KEY (country_code) REFERENCES Countries (iso_code)
) org.hibernate.MappingException: Repeated column in mapping for entity: com.kawoolutions.bbstats.model.Zip column: country_code (should be mapped with insert="false" update="false")
org.hibernate.mapping.PersistentClass.checkColumnDuplication(PersistentClass.java:676)
org.hibernate.mapping.PersistentClass.checkPropertyColumnDuplication(PersistentClass.java:698)
... @Entity
@Table(name = "Zips")
public class Zip implements Serializable
{
    @EmbeddedId
    private ZipId id;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "country_code", referencedColumnName = "iso_code")
    private Country country = null;
...
} @Embeddable
public class ZipId implements Serializable
{
    @Column(name = "country_code", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private String countryCode;

    @Column(name = "code")
    private String code;

@LINK:/questions/2954381/python-form-post-using-urllib2-also-question-on-saving-using-cookies
@TITLE:Python form POST using urllib2 (also question on saving/using cookies)
@CONTENT:I am trying to write a function to post form data and save returned cookie info in a file so that the next time the page is visited, the cookie information is sent to the server (i.e. normal browser behavior). I wrote this relatively easily in C++ using curlib, but have spent almost an entire day trying to write this in Python, using urllib2 - and still no success. This is what I have so far: import urllib, urllib2
import logging

# the path and filename to save your cookies in
COOKIEFILE = 'cookies.lwp'

cj = None
ClientCookie = None
cookielib = None


logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Let's see if cookielib is available
try:
    import cookielib
except ImportError:
    logger.debug('importing cookielib failed. Trying ClientCookie')
    try:
        import ClientCookie
    except ImportError:
        logger.debug('ClientCookie isn\'t available either')
        urlopen = urllib2.urlopen
        Request = urllib2.Request
    else:
        logger.debug('imported ClientCookie succesfully')
        urlopen = ClientCookie.urlopen
        Request = ClientCookie.Request
        cj = ClientCookie.LWPCookieJar()

else:
    logger.debug('Successfully imported cookielib')
    urlopen = urllib2.urlopen
    Request = urllib2.Request

    # This is a subclass of FileCookieJar
    # that has useful load and save methods
    cj = cookielib.LWPCookieJar()


login_params = {'name': 'anon', 'password': 'pass' }

def login(theurl, login_params):
  init_cookies();

  data = urllib.urlencode(login_params)
  txheaders =  {'User-agent' : 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)'}

  try:
    # create a request object
    req = Request(theurl, data, txheaders)

    # and open it to return a handle on the url
    handle = urlopen(req)

  except IOError, e:
    log.debug('Failed to open "%s".' % theurl)
    if hasattr(e, 'code'):
      log.debug('Failed with error code - %s.' % e.code)
    elif hasattr(e, 'reason'):
      log.debug("The error object has the following 'reason' attribute :"+e.reason)
      sys.exit()

  else:

    if cj is None:
      log.debug('We don\'t have a cookie library available - sorry.')
    else:
      print 'These are the cookies we have received so far :'
      for index, cookie in enumerate(cj):
        print index, '  :  ', cookie

      # save the cookies again  
      cj.save(COOKIEFILE) 

      #return the data
      return handle.read()



# FIXME: I need to fix this so that it takes into account any cookie data we may have stored
  def get_page(*args, **query):
    if len(args) != 1:
        raise ValueError(
            "post_page() takes exactly 1 argument (%d given)" % len(args)
        )
    url = args[0]
    query = urllib.urlencode(list(query.iteritems()))
    if not url.endswith('/') and query:
        url += '/'
    if query:
        url += "?" + query
    resource = urllib.urlopen(url)
    logger.debug('GET url "%s" => "%s", code %d' % (url,
                                                    resource.url,

    return resource.read() 
 When I attempt to log in, I pass the correct username and pwd,. yet the login fails, and no cookie data is saved. My two questions are: can anyone see whats wrong with the login() function, and how may I fix it? how may I modify the get_page() function to make use of any cookie info I have saved ?

@TITLE:How to avoid delay in Android GCM messages / change heartbeat
@CONTENT:I've been reading many posts regarding a GCM issue that affects some people. It seems that in some devices/routers/carriers the notifications suffer delays. I've experienced this issue with my router: messages came with a lot of delay on WIFI but came instantly when I disabled WIFI and connected to the mobile net. It seems there is a workaround that can be done from the Android app. Something like increasing the heartbeat that keeps GCM connection alive, or so. Can anyone tell us what should we do to avoid the delay? How can we keep the connection with GCM from an Android app? A code example (and where and how to use it) would be really helpful. This post explains the problem. It says that "we could keep the connection alive with a ping every two minutes from the GCM server (which is free)". How can we do that? Thanks a lot The following apps seem to do the trick. Surprisingly, the first one doesn't need any permission, the second one internet connection and the third one is only for rooted phones: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.pansy.droid.gcmWifiFix https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elotro.pushheartbeat https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andqlimax.pushfixer

@TITLE:Repository pattern with Entity framework
@CONTENT:Repository pattern is used to abstract from particular database and object-relation-mapping technology(like EF) used. So I can easily replace (for example) my Entity framework mappings with Linq to SQL in the future if I decide to do so. But when I use EF I have my entity classes from the model - that is they are generated from that visual diagram. If I use this generated entity classes in my repository and then decide to replace EF by something else then I will delete that visual entity diagram and that means also to delete classes right ? The point I'm addressing is that my repository will be dependent on Entity framework, that is on data access layer because it will use classes generated by EF. How do I remove this dependency ? Also note that I use EF primarily because of its ability to generate everything from that visual diagram - I just design the diagram and let it generate database for me with all the foreign keys etc. I like that very much and don't want to even think about SQL commands.

@LINK:/questions/6740153/simple-pdo-wrapper
@TITLE:Simple PDO wrapper
@CONTENT:My web application currently has do execute simple queries: simple CRUD operations, counting,... A few months ago, someone recommended me here to write a simple PDO wrapper for this (to avoid writing try/catch, prepare(), execute(), etc. each time a query should be executed). This example method was shown (I've made some changes so I could use it in my own project): public function execute() {
    $args  = func_get_args();
    $query = array_shift($args);
    $result = false;

    try {
      $res = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
      $result = $res->execute($args);
    } catch (PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); }

    return $result;
  }
 As I need to perform more operations (executing queries, retrieving 1 record, retrieving multiple records, counting results) I created a method for all of these:   public function getMultipleRecords() {
    $args  = func_get_args();
    $query = array_shift($args);
    $records = array();

    try {
      $res = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
      $res->execute($args);
      $records = $res->fetchAll();
    } catch (PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); }

    return $records;
  }

  public function getSingleRecord() {
    $args  = func_get_args();
    $query = array_shift($args);
    $record = array();

    try {
      $res = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
      $res->execute($args);
      $record = $res->fetch();
    } catch (PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); }

    return $record;
  }

  public function execute() {
    $args  = func_get_args();
    $query = array_shift($args);
    $result = false;

    try {
      $res = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
      $result = $res->execute($args);
    } catch (PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); }

    return $result;
  }

  public function count() {
    $args  = func_get_args();
    $query = array_shift($args);
    $result = -1;

    try {
      $res = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
      $res->execute($args);
      $result = $res->fetchColumn();
    } catch(PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); }

    return $result;
  }
 As you see, most of the code is the same. Only 2 lines of code are different for each method: the initialisation of $result (I always want to return a value, even if the query fails) and the fetching. Instead of using 4 methods, I could write just one of them and pass an extra parameter with the type of action. That way, I could use a bunch of if/else statements of a switch statement. However, I think the code can get messy. Is this a good way for solving this problem? If not, what would be a good solution to it? The second problem I have (which is why I'm working on this class right now) is that I want to use prepared statements with the LIMIT SQL statement. However, it is not possible to do this: $res = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM table LIMIT ?");
$res->execute(array($int));
 The variabele will be quoted for some reason (and so the query will fail), as explained here: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40740 The solution seems to use bindValue() and use the int datatype as a parameter: http://www.php.net/manual/de/pdostatement.bindvalue.php I could rewrite the method(s) to support this, but I would also need to use an extra parameter. I can't just use $db->execute($sql, $variable1, $variable2); anymore as I need to know the data type. What's the best way to solve this? Thanks

@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a "remember me" feature to my login form. I am using ASP.NET MVC as my web application. I managed to get the cookie stuff working, but I failed to automatically login the user in case he/she checked the remember me checkbox before. I know what the problem is but I do not know how to solve it. In my HomeController I have the following: private LoginViewModel CheckLoginCookie()
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_appCookies.Email) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(_appCookies.Password))
    {
        var login = new LoginViewModel
                        {
                            Email = _appCookies.Email,
                            Password = _appCookies.Password
                        };

        return login;
    }
    return null;
}


public ActionResult Index()
{
    var login = CheckLoginCookie();
    if (login != null)
        return RedirectToAction("Login", "User", login);

    var viewModel = new HomeIndexViewModel
                        {
                            IntroText =
                                "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
                            LastMinuteDeals = new List<ItemsIndexViewModel>(),
                            TrustedDeals = new List<ItemsIndexViewModel>()
                        };
    return View(viewModel);
}
 And in my UserController, I have the Login action method: public ActionResult Login()
{
    return PartialView(new LoginViewModel());
}

[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Login(LoginViewModel dto)
{
    bool flag = false;
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        if (_userService.AuthenticateUser(dto.Email, dto.Password, false)) {
            var user = _userService.GetUserByEmail(dto.Email);
            var uSession = new UserSession
            {
                ID = user.Id,
                Nickname = user.Nickname
            };
            SessionManager.RegisterSession(SessionKeys.User, uSession);
            flag = true;

            if(dto.RememberMe)
            {
                _appCookies.Email = dto.Email;
                _appCookies.Password = dto.Password;
            }
        }
    }
    if (flag)
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    else
    {
        ViewData.Add("InvalidLogin", "The login info you provided were incorrect.");
        return View(dto);
    }
}
 So basically, what I thought I would do is to redirect the user from the Index action result on the home controller in case there was a login cookie. But the problem is that the RedirectToAction will trigger the GET Login action method and not the POST which takes care of logging in the user. Am I going completely wrong about this? Or is there some way I could call the POST Login method using RedirectToAction or any other way?

{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_appCookies.Email) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(_appCookies.Password))

                            Email = _appCookies.Email,
                            Password = _appCookies.Password
                        };

        return login;
    }
    return null;
}

    var login = CheckLoginCookie();

@TITLE:Connecting to a remote IPython instance
@CONTENT:I would like to run an IPython instance on one machine and connect to it (over LAN) from a different process (to run some python commands). I understand that it is possible with zmq : http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/ipythonzmq.html . However, I can not find documentation on how to do it and whether it is even possible yet. Any help would be appreciated! EDIT I would like to be able to connect to IPython kernel instance and send it python commands. However, this should not be done via a graphic tool (qtconsole) , but I want to be able to connect to that kernel instance from within a different python script... e.g. external.py somehow_connect_to_ipython_kernel_instance
instance.run_command("a=6")

@LINK:/questions/8980193/walking-page-tables-of-a-process-in-linux
@TITLE:Walking page tables of a process in Linux
@CONTENT:i'm trying to navigate the page tables for a process in linux. In a kernel module i realized the following function: static struct page *walk_page_table(unsigned long addr)
{
    pgd_t *pgd;
    pte_t *ptep, pte;
    pud_t *pud;
    pmd_t *pmd;

    struct page *page = NULL;
    struct mm_struct *mm = current->mm;

    pgd = pgd_offset(mm, addr);
    if (pgd_none(*pgd) || pgd_bad(*pgd))
        goto out;
    printk(KERN_NOTICE "Valid pgd");

    pud = pud_offset(pgd, addr);
    if (pud_none(*pud) || pud_bad(*pud))
        goto out;
    printk(KERN_NOTICE "Valid pud");

    pmd = pmd_offset(pud, addr);
    if (pmd_none(*pmd) || pmd_bad(*pmd))
        goto out;
    printk(KERN_NOTICE "Valid pmd");

    ptep = pte_offset_map(pmd, addr);
    if (!ptep)
        goto out;
    pte = *ptep;

    page = pte_page(pte);
    if (page)
        printk(KERN_INFO "page frame struct is @ %p", page);

 out:
    return page;
}
 This function is called from the ioctl and addr is a virtual address in process address space: static int my_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long addr)
{
   struct page *page = walk_page_table(addr);
   ...
   return 0;
}
 The strange thing is that calling ioctl in a user space process, this segfaults...but it seems that the way i'm looking for the page table entry is correct because with dmesg i obtain for example for each ioctl call: [ 1721.437104] Valid pgd
[ 1721.437108] Valid pud
[ 1721.437108] Valid pmd
[ 1721.437110] page frame struct is @ c17d9b80
 So why the process can't complete correcly the `ioctl' call? Maybe i have to lock something before navigating the page tables? I'm working with kernel 2.6.35-22 and three levels page tables. Thank you all!

But in my limited experience, I have never had to send neither an HTTP PUT nor a DELETE. How do you do it? I have built HTML forms that have method="post" or method="get" and the request is sent to whatever is specified in the action attribute (action="someResource").

Then I would send the request using my programming language and blah blah blah. I am just speculating on this. Please offer up some assistance! I thought that I was a web developer, since I know things like XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. but it's starting to look like I don't know anything about the foundations of the web at all (HTTP).

 So the book comes from rest api and it has many readers attached. I want to get the 'recent' reader. The created_at field has the value which identifies the user as recent.

@CONTENT:Ok, I'm sure there's something simple set wrong here but I'm not 100% what it is. So I am trying to use Select2 AJAX method as a way of users to search a database and select a result. The call itself is coming back with results, however it will not allow me to select the answer from the list. It also doesn't seem to allow you to "select" it on hover or up/ down arrow. So without further ado, here is my code: index.html <html>

 select.js jQuery(function() {

@CONTENT:These days we can drag & drop files into a special container and upload them with XHR 2. Many at a time. With live progress bars etc. Very cool stuff. Example here. But sometimes we don't want that much coolness. What I'd like is to drag & drop files -- many at a time -- into a standard HTML file input: <input type=file multiple>. Is that possible? Is there some way to 'fill' the file input with the right filenames (?) from the file drop? (Full filepaths aren't available for file system security reasons.) Why? Because I'd like to submit a normal form. For all browsers and all devices. The drag & drop is just progressive enhancement to enhance & simplify UX. The standard form with standard file input (+ multiple attribute) will be there. I'd like to add the HTML5 enhancement. edit I know in some browsers you can sometimes (almost always) drop files into the file input itself. I know Chrome usually does this, but sometimes it fails and then loads the file in the current page (a big fail if you're filling out a form). I want to fool- & browserproof it.

@TITLE:a href link for entire div in HTML/CSS
@CONTENT:Here is what I am trying to accomplish in HTML/CSS: I have images in different heights and widths, but they are all under 180x235. So what I want to do is create a div with border and vertical-align: middle them all. I have successfully done that but now I am stuck on how to properly a href link the entire div. Here is my code: <div id="parentdivimage" style="position:relative;width:184px;height:235px;border-width:2px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;text-align:center;">

    </div>
</div>
 Please note that for the sake of copy pasting here easily, the style code is inline. I read somewhere that I can simply add another parent div on top of the code and then do a href inside that. However, based on some research it won't be valid code. So to sum it up again, I need the entire div (#parentdivimage) to be a href link.

@TITLE:Can you use hash navigation without affecting history?
@CONTENT:I'm afraid it might be impossible but is there a way to change the hash value of a URL without leaving an entry in the browser's history and without reloading? Or do the equivalent? As far as specifics go, I was developing some basic hash navigation along the lines of: //hash nav -- works with js-tabs
var getHash = window.location.hash;
var hashPref = "tab-";
function useHash(newHash) {
    //set js-tab according to hash
    newHash = newHash.replace('#'+hashPref, '');
    $("#tabs li a[href='"+ newHash +"']").click();
}
function setHash(newHash) {
    //set hash according to js-tab
    window.location.hash = hashPref + newHash;

    //THIS IS WHERE I would like to REPLACE the location.hash
    //without a history entry

}
    // ... a lot of irrelavent tabs js and then....

    //make tabs work
    $("#tabs.js-tabs a").live("click", function() {
        var showMe = $(this).attr("href");
        $(showMe).show();
        setHash(showMe);
        return false;
    });
    //hash nav on ready .. if hash exists, execute
    if ( getHash ){
        useHash(getHash);
    }
 Using jQuery, obviously. The idea is that in this specific instance 1) making the user go back over every tab change could effectively 'break the back button' by piling up needless references, and 2) not retaining which tab they're currently on if they hit refresh is an annoyance.
@CODE://hash nav -- works with js-tabs
var getHash = window.location.hash;

// something like this?
myvalue = myTask.getvalue() 
 EDIT: This was asked a long time ago where I wasn't familiar with Java, now that I'm better with it, I 'll do a quick summary: The point of async task is that the task is asynchronous, meaning that after you call execute() on the task, the task starts running on a thread of its own. returning a value from asynctask would be pointless because the original calling thread has already carried on doing other stuff (thus the task is asynchronous). Think of time: At one point of time, you started a task that will run in parallel with the main thread. When the parallel-running task completed, time has also elapsed on the main thread. The parallel task cannot go back in time to return a value to the main thread. I was coming from C so I didn't much about this. But it seems that lots of people are having the same question so I thought I would clear it up a bit.

@CONTENT:I've been using the new preview of android studio and really like it. But recently my project won't build. I get the following error: Gradle: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':TestProj:compileDebug'.
> Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip'.
 Question is how do I enable the stack trace so I can get to the root of the error. As it is I really have no idea what's causing this.

@TITLE:IE7 CSS Scrolling Div Bug
@CONTENT:I recently came across an IE7 only bug that I thought I'd share so when I come to this site 6 months from now to figure out the same thing, I'll have it on hand. I believe the easiest way to recreate this bug would be the following html in a page with a declared doctype (it works correctly in "quirks mode" / no-doctype): <div style="overflow: auto; height: 150px;">
    <div style="position: relative;">[...]</div>
</div>
 In IE7, the outer div is a fixed size and the inner div is relatively positioned and contains more content (assuming the inner div causes an overflow). In all other browsers, this seems to work as expected. Screenshot:

@TITLE:In C# what is the difference between a destructor and a Finalize method in a class?
@CONTENT:What is the difference, if there is one, between a destructor and a Finalize method in a class? I recently discovered that Visual Studio 2008 considers a destructor synonymous with a Finalize method, meaning that Visual Studio won't let you simultaneously define both methods in a class. For example, the following code fragment: class TestFinalize
{
    ~TestFinalize()
    {
        Finalize();
    }

    public bool Finalize()
    {
        return true;
    }
}
 Gives the following error on the call to Finalize in the destructor: The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'TestFinalize.~TestFinalize()' and 'TestFinalize.Finalize()' And if the call to Finalize is commented out, it gives the following error: Type 'ManagementConcepts.Service.TestFinalize' already defines a member called 'Finalize' with the same parameter types
@CODE:class TestFinalize
{
    ~TestFinalize()
    {
        Finalize();
    }

@TITLE:Where are the Properties.Default.Settings stored?
@CONTENT:I thought I knew this, but today I'm being proven wrong - again. Running VS2008, .NET 3.5 and C#. I added the User settings to the Properties Settings tab with default values, then read them in using this code: myTextBox.Text = Properties.Settings.Default.MyStringProperty;
 Then, after the user edits the value in the options dialog I save it like this: Properties.Settings.Default.MyStringProperty = myTextBox.Text;
Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
 My question is, where is this new value saved? the MyApp.exe.config file in the executable directory is not updated, it still contains the default values. Plus, as far as I can tell, none of the other files in that directory are updated either! However, when the program reads the value back in, it gets the changed value, so I know it's saved somewhere... This isn't just academic, I needed to be able to manually edit the value this morning and got myself stumped when I couldn't find anything that was changing. Thanks for any insight, Dave

@CONTENT:Current situation: I have dependencies in my project that I solve by using dependency injection. I want to take the next logic step by using a dependency injection container (DIC) to ease the management of my dependencies and to lazy-load classes. I looked at Bucket, Pimple, and sfServiceContainer, ran some test and really appreciate how DIC¡¦s work. I¡¦d probably go for Pimple because of its simplicity and raw power. If I didn¡¦t have this problem: Due to the abstraction that DIC¡¦s offer, the IDE I¡¦m using (PHPStorm) no longer understands what¡¦s going on in my code. It doesn¡¦t understand that $container['mailer'] or $sc->mailer is holding a class object. I also tried Netbeans IDE: same problem. This is really a problem for me because my IDE becomes useless. I don¡¦t want to program without code hints, autocompletion and refactoring tools when dealing with classes. And I don¡¦t want my IDE to find all kinds of false positives when validating code. So my question is: Has anyone dealt with this problem and found a solution?

@TITLE:What is the difference between ¡§long¡¨, ¡§long long¡¨, ¡§long int¡¨, and ¡§long long int¡¨ in C++?
@CONTENT:I am transitioning from Java to C++ and have some questions about the long data type. In Java, to hold an integer greater than 232, you would simply write long x;. However, in C++, it seems that long is both a data type and a modifier. There seems to be several ways to use long: long x;
long long x;
long int x;
long long int x;
 Also, it seems there are things such as: long double x;
 and so on. What is the difference between all of these various data types, and do they all have the same purpose?

@CONTENT:I want to create a dialog which can select the time and the date at the same time. I know that there is not a default widget that can do that on Android. I also know that there are open source projects on how do similar staff. The problem in this project is that in the dialog we have two buttons: datePicker and timePicker. And that's not what I want to do - I want that the date and time picker appear at the same time. So I think the two main problem will be: First make the time and date picker appear in the same dialog. And the second problem will be to change the appearance of time and date picker (the orange color). The first problem was resolved by Bhavesh. Here is what I get: The problem now is that I want to change all blue bar color to orange color.

@TITLE:How to define custom TraceListener in app.config
@CONTENT:I have implemented a custom trace listener (derived from TextWriteTraceListener) and now I would like to set my application to use it instead of standard TextWriteTraceListener. First I added default TextWriteTraceListener in order to make sure it works ok and it does. Here's my app.config: <configuration>
    <system.diagnostics>
        <trace autoflush="true" indentsize="4">
            <listeners>
                <add name="TextListener"  type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="trace.log" />
            <remove name="Default" />
            </listeners>
        </trace>
    </system.diagnostics>
</configuration>
 Now my trace listener is defined in MyApp.Utils namespace and it's called FormattedTextWriterTraceListener. So I changed the type in the config above to MyApp.Utils.FormattedTextWriterTraceListener and it currently looks like that: <configuration>
    <system.diagnostics>
        <trace autoflush="true" indentsize="4">
            <listeners>
                <add name="MyTextListener" type="MyApp.Utils.FormattedTextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="trace.log" />
            <remove name="Default" />
            </listeners>
        </trace>
    </system.diagnostics>
</configuration>
 However now when I try to log something I'm getting a ConfigurationErrorsException with the message: Couldn't find type for class MyApp.Utils.FormattedTextWriterTraceListener. Does anyone knows how can I set up this custom listener in config and if it's even possible?

@CONTENT:I want to get the distinct values in a list, but not by the standard equality comparison. What I want to do is something like this: return myList.Distinct( (x, y) => x.Url == y.Url );
 I can't, there's no extension method in Linq that will do this - just one that takes an IEqualityComparer. I can hack around it with this: return myList.GroupBy( x => x.Url ).Select( g => g.First() );
 But that seems messy. It also doesn't quite do the same thing - I can only use it here because I have a single key. I could also add my own: public static IEnumerable<T> Distinct<T>( 
    this IEnumerable<T> input, Func<T,T,bool> compare )
{
    //write my own here
}
 But that does seem rather like writing something that should be there in the first place. Anyone know why this method isn't there? Am I missing something?

@CONTENT:When switched to AFNetworking 2.0 the AFHTTPClient has been replaced by AFHTTPRequestOperationManager / AFHTTPSessionManager (as mentioned in the migration guide). The very first issue I came across when using the AFHTTPSessionManager is how to retrieve the body of the response in the failure block? Here's an example: [self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    // How to get the status code? response?
}];
 In the success block I would like to retrieve response's status code. In the failure block I would like to retrieve both response's status code and the content (which is JSON in this case that describes the server-side error). The NSURLSessionDataTask has a response property of type NSURLResponse, which has not statusCode field. Currently I'm able to retrieve statusCode like this: [self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    NSHTTPURLResponse *response = (NSHTTPURLResponse *)task.response;
    DDLogError(@"Response statusCode: %i", response.statusCode);

}];
 But this looks ugly to me. And still can't figure about the response's body. Any suggestions?
@CODE:[self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    // How to get the status code? response?
}]; [self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {

@TITLE:AFNetworking 2.0 AFHTTPSessionManager: how to get status code and response JSON in failure block?
@CONTENT:When switched to AFNetworking 2.0 the AFHTTPClient has been replaced by AFHTTPRequestOperationManager / AFHTTPSessionManager (as mentioned in the migration guide). The very first issue I came across when using the AFHTTPSessionManager is how to retrieve the body of the response in the failure block? Here's an example: [self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    // How to get the status code? response?
}];
 In the success block I would like to retrieve response's status code. In the failure block I would like to retrieve both response's status code and the content (which is JSON in this case that describes the server-side error). The NSURLSessionDataTask has a response property of type NSURLResponse, which has not statusCode field. Currently I'm able to retrieve statusCode like this: [self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    NSHTTPURLResponse *response = (NSHTTPURLResponse *)task.response;
    DDLogError(@"Response statusCode: %i", response.statusCode);

}];
 But this looks ugly to me. And still can't figure about the response's body. Any suggestions?
@CODE:[self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {

}]; [self.sessionManager POST:[endpoint absoluteString] parameters:params success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
    // How to get the status code?
} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    NSHTTPURLResponse *response = (NSHTTPURLResponse *)task.response;

@TITLE:Collision detection of huge number of circles
@CONTENT:What is the best way to check collision of huge number of circles? It's very easy to detect collision between two circles, but if we check every combination then it is O(n2) which definitely not an optimal solution. We can assume that circle object has following properties: Coordinates Radius Velocity Direction Velocity is constant, but direction can change. I've come up with two solutions, but maybe there are some better solutions. Solution 1 Divide whole space into overlapping squares and check for collision only with circles that are in the same square. Squares need to overlap so there won't be a problem when a circle moves from one square to another. Solution 2 At the beginning distances between every pair of circles need to be calculated. If the distance is small then these pair is stored in some list, and we need to check for collision in every update. If the distance is big then we store after which update there can be a collision (it can be calculated because we know the distance and velocitites). It needs to be stored in some kind of priority queue. After previously calculated number of updates distance needs to be checked again and then we do the same procedure - put it on the list or again in the priority queue. Answers to Mark Byers questions Is it for a game? It's for simulation, but it can be treated also as a game Do you want to recalculate the new position every n milliseconds, and also check for collisions at this time? Yes, time between update is constant. Do you want to find the time at which the first/every collision occurs? No, I want to find every collision and do 'something' when it occures. How important is accuracy? It depends on what do you mean by accuracy. I need to detect all collisions. Is it a big problem if very small fast moving circles can pass through each other occasionally? It can be assumed that speed is so small that it won't happen.

@LINK:/questions/6836299/jquery-asynchronous-function-call-no-ajax-request
@TITLE:jQuery asynchronous function call, no AJAX request
@CONTENT:This seems silly, but I can't find how to do an asynchronous function call with jQuery that doesn't involve some server-side request. I have a slow function that iterates through a lot of DOM elements, and I want the browser to not freeze up while this function is running. I want to display a little indicator before the slow function is called, then when the slow function returns, I want to hide the indicator. I have the following: $('form#filter', parentNode).submit(function() {
  var form = $(this);
  indicator.show();
  var textField = $('input#query', form);
  var query = jQuery.trim(textField.val());
  var re = new RegExp(query, "i");
  slowFunctionCall(); // want this to happen asynchronously; all client-side
  indicator.hide();
  return false;
});
 Currently I submit the form and the indicator isn't displayed, the browser freezes, and then slowFunctionCall is finished. Edit: I used Vivin's answer, specifically the Sitepoint link to get the following solution: var indicator = $('#tagFilter_loading', parentNode);
indicator.hide();
var spans = $('div#filterResults span', parentNode);
var textField = $('input#query', parentNode);
var timer = undefined, processor = undefined;
var i=0, limit=spans.length, busy=false;
var filterTags = function() {
  i = 0;
  if (processor) {
    clearInterval(processor);
  }
  indicator.show();
  processor = setInterval(function() {
    if (!busy) {
      busy = true;
      var query = jQuery.trim(textField.val()).toLowerCase();
      var span = $(spans[i]);
      if ('' == query) {
        span.show();
      } else {
        var tagName = span.attr('rel').toLowerCase();
        if (tagName.indexOf(query) == -1) {
          span.hide();
        }
      }
      if (++i >= limit) {
        clearInterval(processor);
        indicator.hide();
      }
      busy = false;
    }
  }, 1);
};
textField.keyup(function() {
  if (timer) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  }
  /* Only start filtering after the user has finished typing */
  timer = setTimeout(filterTags, 2000);
});
textField.blur(filterTags);
 This shows and hides the indicator and also doesn't freeze the browser. You get to watch the DOM elements being hidden as it works, which is what I was going for.
@CODE:$('form#filter', parentNode).submit(function() {
  var form = $(this);
  indicator.show();
  var textField = $('input#query', form);
  var query = jQuery.trim(textField.val());
  var re = new RegExp(query, "i");
  slowFunctionCall(); // want this to happen asynchronously; all client-side
  indicator.hide();
  return false;
}); slowFunctionCall var indicator = $('#tagFilter_loading', parentNode);
indicator.hide();
var spans = $('div#filterResults span', parentNode);
var textField = $('input#query', parentNode);
var timer = undefined, processor = undefined;
var i=0, limit=spans.length, busy=false;
var filterTags = function() {
  i = 0;
  if (processor) {
    clearInterval(processor);
  }
  indicator.show();
  processor = setInterval(function() {
    if (!busy) {
      busy = true;
      var query = jQuery.trim(textField.val()).toLowerCase();
      var span = $(spans[i]);

      } else {

        if (tagName.indexOf(query) == -1) {

        }
      }

        indicator.hide();
      }

  }, 1);

@CONTENT:I've just started using Linq to SQL, and I'm wondering if anyone has any best practices they can share for managing dbml files. How do you keep them up to date with the database? Do you have a single dbml file for the entire database, or is it split into multiple logical units? How does managing this file work in a team environment? Any other tips and tricks welcome.

@TITLE:Using grunt server, how can I redirect all requests to root url?
@CONTENT:I am building my first Angular.js application and I'm using Yeoman. Yeoman uses Grunt to allow you to run a node.js connect server with the command 'grunt server'. I'm running my angular application in html5 mode. According to the angular docs, this requires a modification of the server to redirect all requests to the root of the application (index.html), since angular apps are single page ajax applications. "Using [html5] mode requires URL rewriting on server side, basically you have to rewrite all your links to entry point of your application (e.g. index.html)" The problem that I'm trying to solve is detailed in this question. How can I modify my grunt server to redirect all page requests to the index.html page?

@TITLE:Ensuring that things run on the UI thread in WPF
@CONTENT:I'm building a WPF application. I'm doing some async communication with the server side, and I use event aggregation with Prism on the client. Both these things results in new threads to be spawned which are not the UI thread. If I attempt to do "WPF operations" on these callback and event handler threads the world will fall apart, which it now has started doing. First I met problems trying to create some WPF objects in the callback from server. I was told that the thread needed to run in STA mode. Now I'm trying to update some UI data in a Prism event handler, and I'm told that: The caller cannot access this thread because a different thread owns it. So; what's the key to getting things right in WPF? I've read up on the WPF Dispatcher in this MSDN post. I'm starting to get it, but I'm no wizard yet. Is the key to always use Dispatcher.Invoke when I need to run something which I'm not sure will be called on the UI thread? Does it matter if it actually was called on the UI thread, and I do Dispatcher.Invoke anyway? Dispatcher.Invoke = synchronously. Dispathcher.BeginInvoke = async? Will Dispatcher.Invoke request the UI thread, and then stop to wait for it? Is it bad practice and risk of less responsive programs? How do I get the dispatcher anyway? Will Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher always give me the dispatcher representing the UI thread? Will there exist more than one Dispatcher, or is "Dispatcher" basically the same as the UI thread for the application? And what's the deal with the BackgroundWorker? When do I use this instead? I assume this is always async? Will everything that runs on the UI thread (by being Invoked) be run in STA apartment mode? I.e. if I have something that requires to be run in STA mode - will Dispatcher.Invoke be sufficient? Anyone wanna clearify things for me? Any related recommendations, etc? Thanks!

Release 2 is going to be released soon and I develop mostly on this branch while on 3 I develop things which will be needed in the further future. When I add some feature on release-2 and it should go to 3 as well, but not to 1, should I: merge release-2 to master and cherry-pick feature related commit to release-3? cherry-pick feature related commit to master and than cherry-pick it to release-3? sth else? When I need to changes sth in all the versions, should I do it on master and cherry-pick it to all the branches? Should I keep master up to date with the newest(release-3 branch) or rather developer on release-3 and merge to the master just before I will need release-4 branch? When I fix sth on release-1 or release-2, should I merge or cherry-pick it to master or rather? I'm not quite sure when should I cherry-pick, when should I merge and if the flow of the code between the branches it right.

    mNavigationDrawerFragment = (NavigationDrawerFragment)

            break;
        case 3:

            break;
    }
}

        PlaceholderFragment fragment = new PlaceholderFragment();
        Bundle args = new Bundle();

@CONTENT:What is the difference between using Rfc2898DeriveBytes and just using Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(string object);? I have had relative success with either approach, the former is a more long winded approach where as the latter is simple and to the point. Both seem to allow you to do the same thing eventually but I am struggling to the see the point in using the former over the latter. The basic concept I have been able to grasp is that you can convert string passwords into byte arrays to be used for e.g a symmetric encryption class, AesManaged. Via the RFC class but you get to use salt values and password when creating your rfc object. I assume its more secure but still thats an uneducated guess at best! Also that it allows you to return byte arrays of a certain size, well something like that. Here are a few examples to show you where I am coming from: byte[] myPassinBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("some password");
 or string password = "P@%5w0r]>";
byte[] saltArray = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("this is my salt");
Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfcKey = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, saltArray);
 The 'rfcKey' object can now be used towards setting up the the .Key or .IV properties on a symmetric encryption algorithm class. ie. RijndaelManaged rj = new RijndaelManaged ();
rj.Key = rfcKey.Getbytes(rj.KeySize / 8); 
rj.IV = rfcKey.Getbytes(rj.Blocksize / 8);
 'rj' should be ready to go ! The confusing part ... so rather than using the 'rfcKey' object can I not just use my 'myPassInBytes' array to help set-up my 'rj' object? I have tried doing this in VS2008 and the immediate answer is NO. But have you guys got a better educated answer as to why the RFC class is used over the other alternative I have mentioned above?
@CODE:Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(string object); AesManaged byte[] myPassinBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("some password"); string password = "P@%5w0r]>";
byte[] saltArray = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("this is my salt");
Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfcKey = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, saltArray); RijndaelManaged rj = new RijndaelManaged ();
rj.Key = rfcKey.Getbytes(rj.KeySize / 8); 
rj.IV = rfcKey.Getbytes(rj.Blocksize / 8);

@TITLE:WPF Datagrid Performance
@CONTENT:I am working with the WPF Toolkit data grid and it is scrolling extremely slow at the moment. The grid has 84 columns and 805 rows. (Including 3 fixed columns and the header is fixed.) Scrolling both horizontally and vertically is extremely slow. Virtualization is turned on and I have enabled column virtualization and row virtualization explicitly in the xaml. Is there anything to watch out for that can really effect performance, such as binding methods, or what xaml is in each celltemplate? One thing to note is I am dynamically adding the columns on creation of the datagrid. Could that be effecting anything? (I also dynamically create the celltemplate at the same time so that my bindings are set right.) Below is the code from the template for most of the cells that get generated. Basically for the columns I need to dynamically add (which is most of them), I loop through my list and add the columns using the AddColumn method, plus I dynamically build the template so that the binding statements properly index the right item in the collection for that column. The template isn't too complex, just two TextBlocks, but I do bind four different properties on each. It seems like I was able to squeeze out a little bit more performance by changes the bindings to OneWay:  private void AddColumn(string s, int index)
    {
        DataGridTemplateColumn column = new DataGridTemplateColumn();
        column.Header = s;
        //Set template for inner cell's two rectangles
        column.CellTemplate = CreateFactViewModelTemplate(index);
        //Set Style for header, ie rotate 90 degrees
        column.HeaderStyle = (Style)dgMatrix.Resources["HeaderRotateStyle"];
        column.Width = DataGridLength.Auto;
        dgMatrix.Columns.Add(column);
    }


    //this method builds the template for each column in order to properly bind the rectangles to their color
    private static DataTemplate CreateFactViewModelTemplate(int index)
    {
        string xamlTemplateFormat =
            @"<DataTemplate xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""

@LINK:/questions/10253663/how-to-detect-the-dragleave-event-in-firefox-when-dragging-outside-the-window
@TITLE:How to detect the dragleave event in Firefox when dragging outside the window
@CONTENT:Firefox doesn't properly trigger the dragleave event when dragging outside of the window: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665704 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=656164 I'm trying to develop a workaround for this (which I know is possible because Gmail is doing it), but the only thing I can come up with seems really hackish. One way of knowing when dragging outside the window has occurred it to wait for the dragover event to stop firing (because dragover fires constantly during a drag and drop operation). Here's how I'm doing that: var timeout;

function dragleaveFunctionality() {
  // do stuff
}

function firefoxTimeoutHack() {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  timeout = setTimeout(dragleaveFunctionality, 200);
}

$(document).on('dragover', firefoxTimeoutHack);
 This code is essentially creating and clearing a timeout over and over again. The 200 millisecond timeout will not be reached unless the dragover event stops firing. While this works, I don't like the idea of using a timeout for this purpose. It feels wrong. It also means there's a slight lag before the "dropzone" styling goes away. The other idea I had was to detect when the mouse leaves the window, but the normal ways of doing that don't seem to work during drag and drop operations. Does anyone out there have a better way of doing this? UPDATE: Here's a link to a demo illustrating the problem I'm seeing. The code is also pasted below: http://philipwalton.com/demos/drag-and-drop.html <!doctype html>

@LINK:/questions/1023860/exponential-moving-average-sampled-at-varying-times
@TITLE:Exponential Moving Average Sampled at Varying Times
@CONTENT:I have a continuous value for which I'd like to calculate an exponential moving average. Normally I'd just use the standard formula for this: Sn = £\Y + (1-£\)Sn-1 where Sn is the new average, £\ is the alpha, Y is the sample, and Sn-1 is the previous average. Unfortunately, due to various issues I don't have a consistent sample time. I may know I can sample at the most, say, once per millisecond, but due to factors out of my control, I may not be able to take a sample for several milliseconds at a time. A likely more common case, however, is that I simple sample a bit early or late: instead of sampling at 0, 1 and 2 ms. I sample at 0, 0.9 and 2.1 ms. I do anticipate that, regardless of delays, my sampling frequency will be far, far above the Nyquist limit, and thus I need not worry about aliasing. I reckon that I can deal with this in a more-or-less reasonable way by varying the alpha appropriately, based on the length of time since the last sample. Part of my reasoning that this will work is that the EMA "interpolates linearly" between the previous data point and the current one. If we consider calculating an EMA of the following list of samples at intervals t: [0,1,2,3,4]. We should get the same result if we use interval 2t, where the inputs become [0,2,4], right? If the EMA had assumed that, at t2 the value had been 2 since t0, that would be the same as the interval t calculation calculating on [0,2,2,4,4], which it's not doing. Or does that make sense at all? Can someone tell me how to vary the alpha appropriately? "Please show your work." I.e., show me the math that proves that your method really is doing the right thing.

@TITLE:What are the benefits of the Iterator interface in Java?
@CONTENT:I just learned about how the Java Collections Framework implements data structures in linked lists. From what I understand, Iterators are a way of traversing through the items in a data structure such as a list. Why is this interface used? Why are the methods hasNext(), next() and remove() not directly coded to the data structure implementation itself? From the Java website: link text public interface Iterator<E> An iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java collections framework. Iterators differ from enumerations in two ways: Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics. Method names have been improved. This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework. I tried googling around and can't seem to find a definite answer. Can someone shed some light on why Sun chose to use them? Is it because of better design? Increased security? Good OO practice? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

@CONTENT:I'm developing an iPhone app that uses the network. The iPhone communicate with my server via HTTP request and should work on WiFi and 3G. I currently use NSURLConnection initWithRequest to send async requests to my server and get responses (but I will soon move to work with ASIHTTPRequest library) I understood that with this kind of apps(apps that requires internet connection) I should (must?) use Reachability. After searching the web and looking at Apple's Reachability example code i still don't understand some basic stuff: What is the main purposes of Reachability? In apple's example they detect network issues with the host, WiFi and 3G and present the user with an appropriate message. Is this the main purpose of Reachability, to show the user a message? Or do I need to use it for other more practical scenarios? For example if NSURLConnaction request has failed do I need to use Reachability somehow to resend the request? What is the proper use of Reachability? Is it common to use only one instance when app launch, and then listen to network changes? Or should I check myself the reachability status before every network request? Is it enough to use reachabilityWithHostName or do I need also reachabilityForLocalWiFi and reachabilityForInternetConnection? One more thing, I understood apple can reject apps that use the network and don't use Reachability. What are the "must" do methods I should implement? Will it be enough to just notify the user that currently there is no internet?

  :update => { :success => "cart", :failure => "error" }
 (an example from the documentation). This example would, upon success update the html-element with class "cart", and upon failure the class "error". Now i believe the modus operandi has changed, instead we write: link_to "Add to cart", :url => {:action => "add", :id => product.id}, 
    :remote => true
 and there is no option to set :update anymore. Instead of a normal html, we now render javascript, like this (in jquery) : $('.cart').replaceWith(<%= escape_javascript(render :partial => 'cart') %>)
 but how do you handle an error situation? Do i handle it in my controller, and use seperate views? It would seem useful to me to somehow be able to mimic the behaviour we had before. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Programmatically show soft keyboard on iPhone in a PhoneGap application?
@CONTENT:I've been searching far and long, and to this moment, I did not come across a working solution for PhoneGap / Cordova applications that would show soft keyboard programmatically. Scenario: We have a PhoneGap application - a website created in jQuery Mobile - that at one point shows a dialog to the user. This dialog is also a web page and has one single INPUT text box where user should enter a code. Problem: When the code dialog is shown, the input box is focused using JavaScript. However, due to restrictions placed on iPhone's internal browser, the soft keyboard does not come up until the user actually really clicks inside the input text box. What we tried: creating a hidden text box and making it first responder making the actual webview a first responder once the input receives focus via JavaScript using sendActionsForControlEvents to try and delive Touch events to the webview (although if anyone has a working code for a PhoneGap application, I would appreciate if they could share it, since I'm no professional in iOS coding) Any ideas? EDIT: The restriction mentioned in this question is for built-in browsers only... if you're aiming Opera, you will be successful by using the following code: var e = jQuery.Event("keydown", { keyCode: 37 });
$('#element').focus().trigger(e);

@CONTENT:I have read through all relevant posts on Prawn but found no mentioning (even in Prawn's own documentation) of headers and footers. However, I did see a demo on Prawnto's own website about headers and footers. I copied the entire source of that demo just to see if it works but an error of undefined method "header" is complained about. Am I to understand that Prawn took out header and footer recently in the gem or is there something else I need to do first to use header and footer? The demo page: http://cracklabs.com/prawnto/code/prawn_demos/source/text/flowing_text_with_header_and_footer the part of code of concern: Prawn::Document.generate("flow_with_headers_and_footers.pdf")  do

  header margin_box.top_left do 
      text "Here's My Fancy Header", :size => 25, :align => :center   
  end

 And by header, just in case, I mean the snippets of words that appear usually at a corner of every page of a document. Like your account number in your bills pages. thanks!

@TITLE:Turning off div wrap for Backbone.Marionette.ItemView
@CONTENT:I'm looking at the Angry Cats Backbone/Marionette tutorial posts here http://davidsulc.com/blog/2012/04/15/a-simple-backbone-marionette-tutorial/ http://davidsulc.com/blog/2012/04/22/a-simple-backbone-marionette-tutorial-part-2/ and I came upon the same question/need posted here: Backbone.js turning off wrap by div in render But I can only get that to work for Backbone.Views, not Backbone.Marionette.ItemViews. For example, from the simple backbone marionette tutorial links above, take AngryCatView: AngryCatView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  template: "#angry_cat-template",
  tagName: 'tr',
  className: 'angry_cat',
  ...
});
 The template, #angry_cat-template, looks like this: <script type="text/template" id="angry_cat-template">
  <td><%= rank %></td>
  <td><%= votes %></td>
  <td><%= name %></td>
  ...
</script>
 What I don't like, is that the AngryCatView needs to have   tagName: 'tr',
  className: 'angry_cat',
 -- if I take tagName out, then angry_cat-template gets wrapped by a <div>. What I would like is to specify the HTML in one place (the angry_cat-template) and not have most HTML (all the <td> tags) in angry_cat-template and a little HTML (the <tr> tag) in AngryCatView. I would like to write this in angry_cat-template: <script type="text/template" id="angry_cat-template">
  <tr class="angry_cat">
    <td><%= rank %></td>
    <td><%= votes %></td>
    <td><%= name %></td>
    ...
  </tr>
</script>
 It just feels cleaner to me but I've been mucking around with Derik Bailey's answer in "Backbone.js turning off wrap by div in render" and can't get it to work for Backbone.Marionette. Any ideas?
@CODE:AngryCatView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  template: "#angry_cat-template",
  tagName: 'tr',
  className: 'angry_cat',
  ...
}); #angry_cat-template <script type="text/template" id="angry_cat-template">
  <td><%= rank %></td>
  <td><%= votes %></td>
  <td><%= name %></td>
  ...
</script> tagName: 'tr',
  className: 'angry_cat', tagName angry_cat-template <div> <td> <tr> <script type="text/template" id="angry_cat-template">
  <tr class="angry_cat">
    <td><%= rank %></td>

@CONTENT:I would like to read a file into a script, line by line. Each line in the file is multiple values seperated by a tab, I'd like to read each line into an array. Typical bash "read file by line" example; while read line
do
echo $line;
done < "myfile"
 For me though, myfile looks like this (tab separated values); value1 value2 value3
value4 value5 value6
 On each iteration of the loop, I'd like each line to go into an array so I can while read line into myArray
do
 echo myArray[0]
 echo myArray[1]
 echo myArray[2]
done < "myfile"
 This would print the following on the first loop iteration; value1
value2
value3
 Then on the second iteration it would print value4
value5
value6
 Is this possible? The only way I can see is to write a small function to break out the values manually, is there built in support in bash for this?

@CONTENT:I have a numpy array that contains some image data. I would like to plot the 'profile' of a transect drawn across the image. The simplest case is a profile running parallel to the edge of the image, so if the image array is imdat, then the profile at a selected point (r,c) is simply imdat[r] (horizontal) or imdat[:,c] (vertical). Now, I want to take as input two points (r1,c1) and (r2,c2), both lying inside imdat. I would like to plot the profile of the values along the line connecting these two points. What is the best way to get values from a numpy array, along such a line? More generally, along a path/polygon? I have used slicing and indexing before, but I can't seem to arrive at an elegant solution for such a where consecutive slice elements are not in the same row or column. Thanks for your help.

I want to implement when we apply double tap, image will be zooming according to the touch place(event x and y).I have to implement only zooming at this time no pan.Can any body suggest me ? Edit: Actually i have implemented that viewflipper with images, if i try to apply pan and zoom effect, sometimes images will be changed.I want to implement zoom effect for where the user is clicked. Give me some idea of that....

@TITLE:How to get matches in iOS using regular expression?
@CONTENT:I got a string like 'stackoverflow.html' and in the regular expression 'stack(.).html' I would like to have the value in (.). I could only find NSPredicate like: NSString    *string     = @"stackoverflow.html";
NSString    *expression = @"stack(.*).html";
NSPredicate *predicate  = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"SELF MATCHES %@", expression];
BOOL match = [predicate evaluateWithObject:string]
 But that only tells I got a match and doesn't return a string, when I use NSRegularExpression: NSRange range = [string rangeOfString:expression options:NSRegularExpressionSearch|NSCaseInsensitiveSearch];
if (range.location == NSNotFound) return nil;

NSLog (@"%@", [string substringWithRange:(NSRange){range.location, range.length}]);
 It will give me the total string back, stackoverflow.html, but I am only interested in that whats in (.*). I want to get 'overflow' back. In PHP this was easy to do, but how can you accomplish this in xCode for iOS? Logically if I would do this: NSInteger firstPartLength  = 5;
NSInteger secondPartLength = 5;
NSLog (@"%@", [string substringWithRange:(NSRange){range.location + firstPartLength, range.length - (firstPartLength + secondPartLength)}]
 It gives me the propert result 'overflow'. But the problem is in many cases I dont know the length of the first part or the second part. So is there a way I can get the value that should be in (.*) ? Or must I decide to choose the ugliest method by finding the location of (.) and calculate the first and second part from there? But in regular expression you might also have ([a-z]) but then the ugly way of using another regular expression to get the location of values between () and then use that to calculate the left and right part? And what happends if I have more? like 'A (.) should find the answer to (.*).' I would like to have an array as result with values [0] the value after A and [1] the value after to. I hope my question is clear. Thanks in advance,

@TITLE:Gulp + browserify + 6to5 + source maps
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a gulp task allowing me to use modules in JS (CommonJS is fine), using browserify + 6to5. I also want source mapping to work. So: 1. I write modules using ES6 syntax. 2. 6to5 transpiles these modules into CommonJS (or other) syntax. 3. Browserify bundles the modules. 4. Source maps refers back to the original ES6 files. How to write such a task? Edit: Here's what I have so far: gulp task gulp.task('browserify', function() {
    var source = require('vinyl-source-stream');
    var browserify = require('browserify');
    var to5ify = require('6to5ify');

    browserify({
        debug: true
    })
    .transform(to5ify)
    .require('./app/webroot/js/modules/main.js', {
        entry: true
    })
    .bundle()
    .on('error', function(err) {
        console.log('Error: ' + err.message);
    })
    .pipe(source('bundle.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(destJs));
});
 modules/A.js function foo() {
    console.log('Hello World');

    let x = 10;

    console.log('x is', x);
}

export {
    foo
};
 modules/B.js import {
    foo
}
from './A';

function bar() {
    foo();
}

export {
    bar
};
 modules/main.js import {
    bar
}
from './B';

bar();
 The code seems to be working, but it's not minified and the source map is inline (which is not really working for production).

@TITLE:Android HttpClient OOM on 4G/LTE (HTC Thunderbolt)
@CONTENT:I have gotten some reports from users of crashes when try use my application on Verizon's 4G/LTE. Looking at the stack trace, it looks like Android's HttpClient.execute() implementation is throwing an OOM. This happens only on 4G/LTE devices, specifically HTC Thunderbolt, and only when on 4G/LTE. WiFi, 3G, UMTS are OK. Also works fine on Sprint's WiMax 4G stuff works fine. Two questions: What's the best way to get the attention of Android devs about this? Any better options than reporting on http://code.google.com/p/android/issues? Any ideas on how I can work around this? I don't have a 4G device myself and I can't get this happen in the emulator so I need to make some educated guesses here. I can try to catch the OOM in my code and attempt to cleanup and force GC, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Comments or other suggestions? Here's what my code's doing:     HttpParams params = this.getHttpParams(); // returns params
    ClientConnectionManager cm = new ThreadSafeClientConnManager(params, this.getHttpSchemeRegistry() );
    DefaultHttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient( cm, params );

    HttpResponse response = null;
    request = new HttpGet( url );

    try {

        response = httpClient.execute(request); // <-- OOM on 4G/LTE. OK otherwise
        int statusCode = response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode();
        Log.i("fetcher", "execute returned, http status " + statusCode );

@TITLE:Filtering Table rows using Jquery
@CONTENT:I found a Jquery script that does the table filtering stuff based on input field. This script basically takes the filter, splits each word and filters table rows with each word. So at the end you'll have a list of rows that have all the words in the input field. http://www.marceble.com/2010/02/simple-jquery-table-row-filter/ var data = this.value.split(" ");

$.each(data, function(i, v){
     jo = jo.filter("*:contains('"+v+"')");
});
 Now, what I need is that instead of filtering rows that contains each of the words in the input field. I want to filter all the rows that contain at least one of the word in the input field. One way I've tried is to take each filtered lists into an array...   var rows = new Array();

 $.each(data, function(i, v){
     rows[i] = jo.filter("*:contains('"+v+"')");
 });
 At this stage, I have to make a UNION of all the rows in "rows" array and show them. I'm lost on how to do that exactly. Above script in action - http://marceble.com/2010/jqueryfilter/index.html?TB_iframe=true&width=720&height=540 If I type "cat six" in the filter, I want to show three rows.

@TITLE:Database schema for ACL
@CONTENT:I want to create a schema for a ACL; however, I'm torn between a couple of ways of implementing it. I am pretty sure I don't want to deal with cascading permissions as that leads to a lot of confusion on the backend and for site administrators. I think I can also live with users only being in one role at a time. A setup like this will allow roles and permissions to be added as needed as the site grows without affecting existing roles/rules. At first I was going to normalize the data and have three tables to represent the relations. ROLES { id, name }
RESOURCES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_id }
 A query to figure out whether a user was allowed somewhere would look like this: SELECT id FROM resources WHERE name = ?
SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND resource_id = ? ($user_role_id, $resource->id)
 Then I realized that I will only have about 20 resources, each with up to 5 actions (create, update, view, etc..) and perhaps another 8 roles. This means that I can exercise blatant disregard for data normalization as I will never have more than a couple of hundred possible records. So perhaps a schema like this would make more sense. ROLES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_name }
 which would allow me to lookup records in a single query SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND permission  = ? ($user_role_id, 'post.update')
 So which of these is more correct? Are there other schema layouts for ACL?
@CODE:ROLES { id, name }
RESOURCES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_id } SELECT id FROM resources WHERE name = ?
SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND resource_id = ? ($user_role_id, $resource->id) ROLES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_name } SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND permission  = ? ($user_role_id, 'post.update') JOIN

@TITLE:Database schema for ACL
@CONTENT:I want to create a schema for a ACL; however, I'm torn between a couple of ways of implementing it. I am pretty sure I don't want to deal with cascading permissions as that leads to a lot of confusion on the backend and for site administrators. I think I can also live with users only being in one role at a time. A setup like this will allow roles and permissions to be added as needed as the site grows without affecting existing roles/rules. At first I was going to normalize the data and have three tables to represent the relations. ROLES { id, name }
RESOURCES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_id }
 A query to figure out whether a user was allowed somewhere would look like this: SELECT id FROM resources WHERE name = ?
SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND resource_id = ? ($user_role_id, $resource->id)
 Then I realized that I will only have about 20 resources, each with up to 5 actions (create, update, view, etc..) and perhaps another 8 roles. This means that I can exercise blatant disregard for data normalization as I will never have more than a couple of hundred possible records. So perhaps a schema like this would make more sense. ROLES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_name }
 which would allow me to lookup records in a single query SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND permission  = ? ($user_role_id, 'post.update')
 So which of these is more correct? Are there other schema layouts for ACL?
@CODE:ROLES { id, name }
RESOURCES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_id } SELECT id FROM resources WHERE name = ?
SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND resource_id = ? ($user_role_id, $resource->id) ROLES { id, name }
PERMISSIONS { id, role_id, resource_name } SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE role_id = ? AND permission  = ? ($user_role_id, 'post.update') JOIN

I have two threads that populates data from a data source but different entities (eg: database, from two different tables), seems like single threaded version of the application is running faster than the version with two threads. Why would the reason be? when i look at the performance monitor, both cpu s are very spikey ? is this due to context switching? what are the best practices to jack the CPU and fully utilize it? I hope this is not ambiguous.

@TITLE:Django custom managers - how do I return only objects created by the logged-in user?
@CONTENT:I want to overwrite the custom objects model manager to only return objects a specific user created. Admin users should still return all objects using the objects model manager. Now I have found an approach that could work. They propose to create your own middleware looking like this: #### myproject/middleware/threadlocals.py

try:
    from threading import local
except ImportError:
    # Python 2.3 compatibility
    from django.utils._threading_local import local

_thread_locals = local()

def get_current_user():
    return getattr(_thread_locals, 'user', None)

class ThreadLocals(object):
    """Middleware that gets various objects from the
    request object and saves them in thread local storage."""
    def process_request(self, request):
        _thread_locals.user = getattr(request, 'user', None)

#### end
 And in the Custom manager you could call the get_current_user() method to return only objects a specific user created. class UserContactManager(models.Manager):
    def get_query_set(self):
        return super(UserContactManager, self).get_query_set().filter(creator=get_current_user())
 Is this a good approach to this use-case? Will this work? Or is this like "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut" ? ;-) Just using: Contact.objects.filter(created_by= user)
 in each view doesn`t look very neat to me. EDIT Do not use this middleware approach !!! use the approach stated by Jack M. below After a while of testing this approach behaved pretty strange and with this approach you mix up a global-state with a current request. Use the approach presented below. It is really easy and no need to hack around with the middleware. create a custom manager in your model with a function that expects the current user or any other user as an input. #in your models.py
class HourRecordManager(models.Manager):
    def for_user(self, user):
        return self.get_query_set().filter(created_by=user)

class HourRecord(models.Model):
    #Managers
    objects = HourRecordManager()

#in vour view you can call the manager like this and get returned only the objects from the currently logged-in user.

hr_set = HourRecord.objects.for_user(request.user)

@LINK:/questions/4849076/efficient-method-to-draw-a-line-with-millions-of-points
@TITLE:Efficient method to draw a line with millions of points
@CONTENT:I'm writing an audio waveform editor in Cocoa with a wide range of zoom options. At its widest, it shows a waveform for an entire song (~10 million samples in view). At its narrowest, it shows a pixel accurate representation of the sound wave (~1 thousand samples in a view). I want to be able to smoothly transition between these zoom levels. Some commercial editors like Ableton Live seem to do this in a very inexpensive fashion. My current implementation satisfies my desired zoom range, but is inefficient and choppy. The design is largely inspired by this excellent article on drawing waveforms with quartz: http://supermegaultragroovy.com/blog/2009/10/06/drawing-waveforms/ I create multiple CGMutablePathRef's for the audio file at various levels of reduction. When I'm zoomed all the way out, I use the path that's been reduced to one point per x-thousand samples. When I'm zoomed in all the way in, I use that path that contains a point for every sample. I scale a path horizontally when I'm in between reduction levels. This gets it functional, but is still pretty expensive and artifacts appear when transitioning between reduction levels. One thought on how I might make this less expensive is to take out anti-aliasing. The waveform in my editor is anti-aliased while the one in Ableton is not (see comparison below). I don't see a way to turn off anti-aliasing for CGMutablePathRef's. Is there a non-anti-aliased alternative to CGMutablePathRef in the world of Cocoa? If not, does anyone know of some OpenGL classes or sample code that might set me on course to drawing my huge line more efficiently? Update 1-21-2014: There's now a great library that does exactly what I was looking for: https://github.com/syedhali/EZAudio

@TITLE:WCF: using streaming with Message Contracts
@CONTENT:I am trying to use the WCF streaming with Message Contracts, because I need additional parameters beside the stream itself. Basically I am creating a file upload and download service, with some additional logic on top. Unfortunately, when I try to hit the service from the browser to check that everything is all right, I get the following error: Server Error in '/' Application. Operation 'UploadFile' in contract 'IFileTransferService' uses a MessageContract that has SOAP headers. SOAP headers are not supported by the None MessageVersion. Unfortunately googling for it did not yield any significant result that helped me. Can you guys have help me out? Here the details of the service (I have removed the download part for reason of space). [ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://www.acme.org/2009/04")]
public interface IFileTransferService
{
    [OperationContract(Action = "UploadFile")]
    void UploadFile(FileUploadMessage request);
}

[MessageContract]
public class FileUploadMessage
{
    [MessageHeader(MustUnderstand = true)]
    public FileMetaData Metadata { get; set; }

    [MessageBodyMember(Order = 1)]
    public Stream FileByteStream { get; set; }
}

[DataContract(Namespace = "http://schemas.acme.org/2009/04")]
public class FileMetaData
{
    [DataMember(Name="FileType", Order=0, IsRequired=true)]
    public FileTypeEnum fileType;

    [DataMember(Name="localFilename", Order=1, IsRequired=false)]
    public string localFileName;

    [DataMember(Name = "remoteFilename", Order = 2, IsRequired = false)]
    public string remoteFileName;
}
 I have tried to use both basichttpbinding and a customhttp binding with not positive effect: <customBinding>
    <binding name="customHttpBindingStream">
        <textMessageEncoding messageVersion="Soap12" />
        <httpTransport transferMode="Streamed" maxReceivedMessageSize="2147483647"/>
    </binding>
</customBinding>
 UPDATE: reading the documentation online it seems that streaming with MessageContracts should indeed be possible. Refer for example to MSDN (Large Data and Streaming): Programming Model for Streamed Transfers The programming model for streaming is straightforward. For receiving streamed data, specify an operation contract that has a single Stream typed input parameter. For returning streamed data, return a Stream reference. [...] This rule similarly applies to message contracts. As shown in the following message contract, you can have only a single body member in your message contract that is a stream. If you want to communicate additional information with the stream, this information must be a carried in message headers. The message body is exclusively reserved for the stream content. [MessageContract]
public class UploadStreamMessage
{
   [MessageHeader]
   public string appRef;
   [MessageBodyMember]
   public Stream data;
}
 I have also seen blog posts from people accomplishing services of file upload and download very similar to what I am trying to put together (for example here). UPDATE 2 I have tried creating a small console and self hosting the service with a basicHttpBinding and there it works like a charm. I am starting to believe that the problem might be the hosting on IIS. Any idea? UPDATE 3 See my own answer.

@CONTENT:I would like to rank or sort a collection of items (with size potentially greater than 100,000) where items in the collection have no intrinsic (comparable) value, instead all I have is the comparisons between any two items which have been provided by users in a subjective manner. Example: Consider a collection with elements [a, b, c, d] and comparisons by users b > a, a > d, d > c. The correct order of this collection would be [b, a, d, c]. This example is simple, however there could be more complicated cases: Since the comparisons are subjective, a user could also say that c > b. In which case that would cause a conflict with the ordering above. Also you may not have comparisons that ¡§connects¡¨ all the items, i.e. b > a, d > c. In which case the ordering is ambiguous. It could be [b, a, d, c] or [d, c, b, a]. In this case either ordering is acceptable. If possible it would be nice to somehow take into account multiple instances of the same comparison and give those with higher occurrences more weight. But a solution without this condition would still be acceptable. A similar application of this algorithm was used by Zuckerberg's FaceMash application where he ranked people based on comparisons (if I understood it correctly), but I have not been able to find what that algorithm actually was. Is there an algorithm which already exists that can solve the problem above? I would not like to spend effort trying to come up with one if that is the case. If there is no specific algorithm, is there perhaps certain types of algorithms or techniques which you can point me to?
@CODE:[a, b, c, d] b > a a > d d > c [b, a, d, c] c > b b > a d > c [b, a, d, c] [d, c, b, a]

@TITLE:Responsive Web Design Tips, Best Practices and Dynamic Image Scaling Techniques
@CONTENT:I hope this question doesn't end up being closed for being too broad a subject but I was wondering about Responsive/Adaptive Web Design, i.e. one website for all browsers, all devices. What is the best way to implement such a site when it comes to structure and layout? I've being trying to read up on it since mobile websites are the big thing right now and will be for a while but I can't find a list of tips and guidelines and I figured that if such a resource was available here on SO then we could all benefit. Another thing that gets me is how is dynamic image scaling done? Out of everything this is the thing that puzzles me most because layouts I'm guessing are probably done using percentages rather than pixel values because pixels will vary from one device to another but images are probably the key factor in achieving one website for everything. I'm looking forward to reading people's opinions and answers, even if it is just links to tutorials on the web that I haven't found.

@TITLE:Generating a normal map from a height map?
@CONTENT:I'm working on procedurally generating patches of dirt using randomized fractals for a video game. I've already generated a height map using the midpoint displacement algorithm and saved it to a texture. I have some ideas for how to turn that into a texture of normals, but some feedback would be much appreciated. My height texture is currently a 257 x 257 gray-scale image (height values are scaled for visibility purposes): My thinking is that each pixel of the image represents a lattice coordinate in a 256 x 256 grid (hence, why there are 257 x 257 heights). That would mean that the normal at coordinate (i, j) is determined by the heights at (i, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j), and (i + 1, j + 1) (call those A, B, C, and D, respectively). So given the 3D coordinates of A, B, C, and D, would it make sense to: split the four into two triangles: ABC and BCD calculate the normals of those two faces via cross product split into two triangles: ACD and ABD calculate the normals of those two faces average the four normals ...or is there a much easier method that I'm missing?

@TITLE:A general linux file permissions question: Apache and WordPress
@CONTENT:I moved from a shared hosting to a VPS a few weeks ago and I'm having these annoying permission issues with WordPress. You know you can download and upgrade plugins (and wordpress itself) from the admin panel, but since I moved it started asking me my FTP credentials, which is kinda slow when I have to update ~20 plugins. I think this should be some kind of rights issue. I looked that the shared hosting wordpress files, they all belong to the username and group kovshenin (kovshenin:kovshenin) and the files are -rw-r--r-- and the directories are drwx-r-xr-x. On my VPS apache runs under apache:apache and my files are kovshenin:kovshenin. What should I do to make them readable and writable by both kovshenin and apache? Also, I changed the permissions to 0777 for all files and folders of my wordpress installation, that allowed me to install and delete plugins without FTP, but when I pushed to automatic upgrade to WordPress 2.8.1 it still asked me for my FTP account. Is that a wp issue or did I miss something? Thanks. Update: I managed to run id and id www-data on the MediaTemple shared hosting. User kovshenin is in group kovshenin, and www-data is in group www-data. No more groups. What's the trick? Another update Okay, I added the apache user to the kovshenin group, my wordpress files are kovshenin:kovshenin with rw-rw-r-- permissions and drwxrwxr-x permissions on directories, but something is still wrong. The user apache can access the files and folders, I can use the online Themes and Plugins editor in the wordpress admin panel, I'm able to make changes to the .htaccess file from within wordpress, but plugin/theme installation still asks me for FTP credentials! Any ideas? Thanks.

@TITLE:How does the Netty threading model work in the case of many client connections?
@CONTENT:I intend to use Netty in an upcoming project. This project will act as both client and server. Especially it will establish and maintain many connections to various servers while at the same time serving its own clients. Now, the documentation for NioServerSocketChannelFactory fairly specifies the threading model for the server side of things fairly well - each bound listen port will require a dedicated boss thread throughout the process, while connected clients will be handled in a non-blocking fashion on worker threads. Specifically, one worker thread will be able to handle multiple connected clients. However, the documentation for NioClientSocketChannelFactory is less specific. This also seems to utilize both boss and worker threads. However, the documentation states: One NioClientSocketChannelFactory has one boss thread. It makes a connection attempt on request. Once a connection attempt succeeds, the boss thread passes the connected Channel to one of the worker threads that the NioClientSocketChannelFactory manages. Worker threads seem to function in the same way as for the server case too. My question is, does this mean that there will be one dedicated boss thread for each connection from my program to an external server? How will this scale if I establish hundreds, or thousands of such connections? As a side note. Are there any adverse side effects for re-using a single Executor (cached thread pool) as both the bossExecutor and workerExecutor for a ChannelFactory? What about also re-using between different client and/or server ChannelFactory instances? This is somewhat discussed here, but I do not find those answers specific enough. Could anyone elaborate on this?

@CONTENT:I'm writing my own ContentProvider which will be synced to a web service using a SyncAdapter. Problem happens when the sync adapter is modifying the content provider's data the provider triggers a network sync when internally calling getContentResolver().notifyChange causing a sync loop. The notifyChange with the network sync flag is required for when a client application does the modification but should be avoided when the sync adapter is modifying. How can one, inside a contentprovider, easly tell if it's being used by a client application (which should trigger network sync upon modification) or by a sync adapter (which should not trigger network sync). Currently I'm using different CONTENT_URI's (sync adapter accesses the data using a CONTENT_URI_NO_SYNC and client apps using a CONTENT_URI) to be able to distinguish between the two types of access and set the network sync flag accordingly.

@TITLE:iOS Autolayout Vertically equal space to fill parent view
@CONTENT:I have a view controller with 12 UITextFields. It fits a 3.5" display very well. I need to set it for iPhone 5 (4 inch display) such that all UITextFields cover the whole UIView by adding extra space in between. I am trying to do this by auto layout but it is not working properly. This is my code : - (void) viewWillLayoutSubviews

@TITLE:Print a div using javascript in angularJS single page aplication
@CONTENT:I have a single page web application using angularJS. I need to print a div of certain page. I tried the following: The page contains few div (print.html) <div>
  <div>
    Do not print
  </div>
  <div id="printable">
    Print this div
  </div>
  <button ng-click="printDiv('printableArea');">Print Div</button>
</div>
 The controller has following script: $scope.printDiv = function(divName) {
    var printContents = document.getElementById(divName).innerHTML;
    var originalContents = document.body.innerHTML;        
    document.body.innerHTML = printContents;
    window.print();
    document.body.innerHTML = originalContents;
}
 This code prints the desired div but there is a problem. the statement document.body.innerHTML = originalContents; replaces the body of the whole application since it is a SPA. So when I refresh the page or click on print button again, the whole content of the page is erased. Someone please share some idea to resolve this problem.
@CODE:<div>
  <div>
    Do not print
  </div>
  <div id="printable">
    Print this div
  </div>
  <button ng-click="printDiv('printableArea');">Print Div</button>

    var printContents = document.getElementById(divName).innerHTML;
    var originalContents = document.body.innerHTML;        
    document.body.innerHTML = printContents;

    document.body.innerHTML = originalContents;

@LINK:/questions/22784516/estimating-beacon-proximity-distance-based-on-rssi-bluetooth-le
@TITLE:Estimating beacon proximity/distance based on RSSI - Bluetooth LE
@CONTENT:I've got a simple iOS app which displays the proximity of the Bluetooth LE beacons it detects using such expressions as "immediate", "near" etc. and I need to write something similar on Android. I've followed the tutorial at Android developer and I'm able to list detected devices and now want to estimate the distance/proximity - this is where it's become a problem. According to this SO thread it's just a handful of mathematical calculations. However, they require me to provide a txPower value. According to this tutorial by Dave Smith (and cross-referencing with this Bluetooth SIG statement), it should be broadcast by the beacon devices as an "AD structure" of type 0x0A. So what I do is parse the AD structures and look for the payload of the one that matches the type. Problem: I've got 4 beacons - 2 estimotes and 2 appflares. The estimotes don't broadcast the txPower at all and the appflares broadcast theirs as 0. Is there anything I'm missing here? The iOS app seems to be handling it all without any problem, but using the iOS SDK it does it behind the scenes so I'm not sure how to produce the exact same or similar behaviour. Is there any other way I could solve my problem? In case you'd like to take a look at the code I'm using to parse the AD structures, it's taken from the aforementioned Dave Smith's github and can be found here. The only change I did to that class was add the following method: public byte[] getData() {

    return mData;
}
 And this is how I handle the callback from the scans: // Prepare the callback for BLE device scan
this.leScanCallback = new BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback() {

    @Override
    public void onLeScan(final BluetoothDevice device, int rssi, byte[] scanRecord) {

        if (!deviceList.contains(device)) {

            MyService.this.deviceList.add(device);
            Log.e("Test", "Device: " + device.getName());

            List<AdRecord> adRecords = AdRecord.parseScanRecord(scanRecord);

            for (AdRecord adRecord : adRecords) {

                if (adRecord.getType() == AdRecord.TYPE_TRANSMITPOWER) {

                    Log.e("Test", "size of payload: " + adRecord.getData().length);
                    Log.e("Test", "payload: " + Byte.toString(adRecord.getData()[0]));
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
 And what I see in the console is: 04-01 11:33:35.864: E/Test(15061): Device: estimote
04-01 11:33:36.304: E/Test(15061): Device: estimote

@CONTENT:I want to be able to get a list of all differences between two JavaScript object graphs, with the property names and values where the deltas occur. For what it is worth, these objects are usually retrieved from the server as JSON and typically are no more than a handful of layers deep (i.e. it may be an array of objects that themselves have data and then arrays with other data objects). I want to not only see the changes to basic properties, but differences in the number of members of an array, etc. etc. If I don't get an answer, I will probably end up writing this myself, but hope someone has already done this work or know of someone who has. EDIT: These objects will typically be very close in structure to one another, so we are not talking about objects that are utterly different from one another, but may have 3 or 4 deltas.

@TITLE:How to cast an object in Objective-C
@CONTENT:Is there a way to cast objects in objective-c much like the way objects are cast in VB.NET? For example, I am trying to do the following: // create the view controller for the selected item
FieldEditViewController *myEditController;
switch (selectedItemTypeID) {
    case 3:
        myEditController = [[SelectionListViewController alloc] init];
        myEditController.list = listOfItems;

    case 4:
        // set myEditController to a diff view controller
        break;
}

// load the view
[self.navigationController pushViewController:myEditController animated:YES];
[myEditController release];
 However I am getting a compiler error since the 'list' property exists in the SelectionListViewController class but not on the FieldEditViewController even though SelectionListViewController inherits from FieldEditViewController. This makes sense, but is there a way to cast myEditController to a SelectionListViewController so I can access the 'list' property? For example in VB.NET I would do: CType(myEditController, SelectionListViewController).list = listOfItems
 Thanks for the help!
@CODE:// create the view controller for the selected item
FieldEditViewController *myEditController;

@TITLE:When to use ko.utils.unwrapObservable?
@CONTENT:I've written a few custom bindings using KnockoutJS. I'm still unsure when to use ko.util.unwrapObservable(item) Looking at the code, that call basically checks to see if item is an observable. If it is, return the value(), if it's not, just return the value. Looking at the section on Knockout about creating custom bindings, they have the following syntax: var value = valueAccessor(), allBindings = allBindingsAccessor();
var valueUnwrapped = ko.utils.unwrapObservable(value);
 In this case, they invoke the observable via () but then also call ko.utils.unwrapObservable. I'm just trying to get a handle on when to use one vs. the other or if I should just always follow the above pattern and use both.

It looks like it has deep design issues that make it a minefield of bugs and security holes for the novice. Do you know of any existent or planned initiative to introduce a better (redesigned) language of any kind (not only javascript) for DOM tree manipulation and HTTP requests in next generation browsers? If yes, what is the roadmap for its integration into, say, Firefox, and if no, for what reasons (apart of interoperability) should be JavaScript the only supported language on the browser platform? I already used jQuery and I also read "javascript: the good parts". Indeed the suggestions are good, but what I am not able to understand is: why only javascript? On the server-side (your-favourite-os platform), we can manipulate a DOM tree with every language, even fortran. Why does the client side (the browser platform) support only javascript?

@LINK:/questions/25161425/disable-migrations-when-running-unit-tests-in-django-1-7
@TITLE:Disable migrations when running unit tests in Django 1.7
@CONTENT:Django 1.7 introduced database migrations. When running the unit tests in Django 1.7, it forces a migrate, that takes a long time. So I would like to skip the django migrations, and create the database in the final state. I know that ignoring the migrations can be a bad practice, as that part of the code would not be tested. But that's not the case: I'm running the full migrations in the CI test server (jenkins). I only want to skip the migrations in my local tests, where the speed matters. Some context: Until Django 1.6, when using South, I used the SOUTH_TESTS_MIGRATE setting: By default, South¡¦s syncdb command will also apply migrations if it¡¦s run in non-interactive mode, which includes when you¡¦re running tests - it will run every migration every time you run your tests. If you want the test runner to use syncdb instead of migrate - for example, if your migrations are taking way too long to apply - simply set SOUTH_TESTS_MIGRATE = False in settings.py. However, syncdb does not exist anymore, now it's migrate. And from Django 1.8 I'll use the --keepdb parameter: The --keepdb option can be used to preserve the test database between test runs. This has the advantage of skipping both the create and destroy actions which greatly decreases the time to run tests, especially those in a large test suite. If the test database does not exist, it will be created on the first run and then preserved for each subsequent run. Any unapplied migrations will also be applied to the test database before running the test suite. So this question is limited to Django 1.7.

@TITLE:Winforms TableLayoutPanel adding rows programatically
@CONTENT:I've been fighting with this for a while, and have found that a number of other people struggle with the TableLayoutPanel (.net 2.0 Winforms) as well. Problem I am attempting to take a 'blank' tablelayoutpanel, which has 10 columns defined, then at runtime programatically add rows of controls (i.e. one control per cell). One might have thought that it should be as simple as myTableLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(myControl, 0 /* Column Index */, 0 /* Row index */);
 But that (for me) doesn't add the rows. So maybe adding in a row style myTableLayoutPanel.RowStyles.Clear();
myTableLayoutPanel.RowStyles.Add(new RowStyle(SizeType.Absolute, 30F));
 But that doesn't work either. I've dug around and found out that the myTableLayoutPanel.RowCount usage changes from design time to run time, hence doing myTableLayoutPanel.RowCount++; doesn't actually add another row, not even before/after adding a RowStyle entry for it! Another related issue I am encountering is that the controls will be added to the display, but they all simply get rendered at point 0,0 of the TableLayoutPanel, additionally they are not even constrained to be within the Cell bounds that they are supposed to be displayed within (i.e. with Dock = DockStyle.Fill they still appear way too large/small). Does someone have a working example of adding rows & controls at runtime? Cheers
@CODE:myTableLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(myControl, 0 /* Column Index */, 0 /* Row index */); myTableLayoutPanel.RowStyles.Clear();

@TITLE:Getters, setters, and properties best practices. Java vs. C#
@CONTENT:I'm taking a C# class right now and I'm trying to find out the best way of doing things. I come from a Java background and so I'm only familiar with Java best-practices; I'm a C# novice! In Java if I have a private property, I do this; private String name;

public void setName(String name) {
   this.name = name;
}

public String getName() {
   return this.name;
}
 In C#, I see that there are many ways of doing this. I can do it like Java: private string name;

public void setName(string name) {
   this.name = name;
}

public string getName() {
   return this.name;
}
 Or I can do it this way: private string name;

public string Name {
   get { return name; }
   set { name = value; }
}
 Or: public string Name { get; set; }
 Which one should I use, and what are the caveats or subtleties involved with each approach? When creating classes, I am following general best-practices that I know from Java (especially reading Effective Java). So for example, I am favoring immutability (providing setters only when necessary). I'm just curious to see how these practices fit in with the various ways of providing setters and getters in C#; essentially, how would I translate best-practices from the Java world into C#? EDIT I was posting this as a comment to Jon Skeet's answer but then it got long: What about a non-trivial property (i.e., with significant processing and validation perhaps)? Could I still expose it via a public property but with the logic encapsulated in get and set? Why would/should I do this over having dedicated setter and getter methods (with associated processing and validation logic).
@CODE:private String name;

public void setName(String name) {
   this.name = name;
}

public String getName() {
   return this.name;
} private string name;

public void setName(string name) {
   this.name = name;
}

public string getName() {
   return this.name;
} private string name;

public string Name {
   get { return name; }
   set { name = value; }
} public string Name { get; set; } get set

@TITLE:Non-CRUD operations in a RESTful service
@CONTENT:What is the "RESTful" way of adding non-CRUD operations to a RESTful service? Say I have a service that allows CRUD access to records like this: GET /api/car/123           <- Returns information for the Car object with ID 123
POST /api/car              <- Creates a new car (with properties in the request)
PUT /api/car/123           <- Updates car 123 (with properties in the request)
DELETE /api/car/123        <- Deletes car 123    
POST /api/car/123/wheel/   <- Creates a wheel and associates it to car 123
 If I want to change the car's color, I would simply POST /api/car/123 and include a POST variable for the new color. But let's say I want to purchase a car, and that operation is more complicated than simply updating a "user" record's "owned car" property. Is it RESTful to simply do something like POST /api/car/123/purchase, where "purchase" is essentially a method name? Or should I use a custom HTTP verb, like PURCHASE instead of POST? Or are non-CRUD operations completely outside the scope of REST?
@CODE:GET /api/car/123           <- Returns information for the Car object with ID 123
POST /api/car              <- Creates a new car (with properties in the request)
PUT /api/car/123           <- Updates car 123 (with properties in the request)
DELETE /api/car/123        <- Deletes car 123    
POST /api/car/123/wheel/   <- Creates a wheel and associates it to car 123 POST /api/car/123 POST /api/car/123/purchase PURCHASE POST

@TITLE:Run jQuery code after AngularJS completes rendering HTML
@CONTENT:In controller I get some JSON data using $http or $resource services. Then I write this data in $scope and AngularJS updates HTML structure of the page. My problem is that I need to know what is the new size (width and height) of the list (I mean, HTML DOM element) that is filled with Angular ng-repeat directive. Consequently, I have to run javascript code right after Angular finishes updating DOM structure. What is the proper way to do it? I have searched internet over the last four hours but I couldn't find any solution to my problem. This is how I receive JSON data: var tradesInfo = TradesInfo.get({}, function(data){
    console.log(data);

        $scope.ready = true;


    init();  //I need to call this function after update is complete

});
 And this is what happens in init() function: function init(){
    alert($('#wrapper').width());
    alert($('#wrapper').height());
}

The only way to build the project is to restart VS after every build, which is very awkward. I have found this old blog post http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian/archive/2006/02/17/VS2005FileLocking.aspx - it seems that the problem is really old. Does anyone know what is happening here, or at least some workaround? Update I don't actually run the file. Locking happens after build, not after debug (i.e. start VS - build - build - fail!) And I tried turning antivirus off. It doesn't help. Update 2 Process Explorer shows devenv.exe having loaded the file (in DLLs, not in Handles). It seems like some glitch during build prevented the unloading, but the (first) build completes without any messages other then "1 succeeded, o failed"/

@TITLE:What is the best way to hide the screen while knockout js bindings are being built?
@CONTENT:I'm a huge knockoutjs fan. I use it for all my web development now and simply love it. One thing that I've not been able to figure out though is how to hide the UI while the knockoutjs bindings are being built. For example, I have a very robust user interface with lots of templates being used on my page. The problem that I'm noticing is that when the user first visits the page, they see all of my templates for a split second before the bindings kick in and hide them. What is the best way to fix this problem? I've tried using helper classes to hide them, but then the templates are not able to be displayed using 'visible' and 'if' bindings unless I remove the helper class reference (ie. ui-helper-hidden).

@CONTENT:Often enough, I've found the need to process a list by pairs. I was wondering which would be the pythonic and efficient way to do it, and found this on Google: pairs = zip(t[::2], t[1::2])
 I thought that was pythonic enough, but after a recent discussion involving idioms versus efficiency, I decided to do some tests: import time
from itertools import islice, izip

def pairs_1(t):
    return zip(t[::2], t[1::2]) 

def pairs_2(t):
    return izip(t[::2], t[1::2]) 

def pairs_3(t):
    return izip(islice(t,None,None,2), islice(t,1,None,2))

A = range(10000)
B = xrange(len(A))

def pairs_4(t):
    # ignore value of t!
    t = B
    return izip(islice(t,None,None,2), islice(t,1,None,2))

for f in pairs_1, pairs_2, pairs_3, pairs_4:
    # time the pairing
    s = time.time()
    for i in range(1000):
        p = f(A)
    t1 = time.time() - s

    # time using the pairs
    s = time.time()
    for i in range(1000):
        p = f(A)
        for a, b in p:
            pass
    t2 = time.time() - s
    print t1, t2, t2-t1
 These were the results on my computer: 1.48668909073 2.63187503815 1.14518594742

 If I'm interpreting them correctly, that should mean that the implementation of lists, list indexing, and list slicing in Python is very efficient. It's a result both comforting and unexpected. Is there another, "better" way of traversing a list in pairs? Note that if the list has an odd number of elements then the last one will not be in any of the pairs. Which would be the right way to ensure that all elements are included? I added these two suggestions from the answers to the tests: def pairwise(t):
    it = iter(t)
    return izip(it, it)

def chunkwise(t, size=2):
    it = iter(t)
    return izip(*[it]*size)
 These are the results: 0.00159502029419 1.25745987892 1.25586485863
0.00222492218018 1.23795199394 1.23572707176
 Results so far Most pythonic and very efficient: pairs = izip(t[::2], t[1::2])
 Most efficient and very pythonic: pairs = izip(*[iter(t)]*2)
 It took me a moment to grok that the first answer uses two iterators while the second uses a single one. To deal with sequences with an odd number of elements, the suggestion has been to augment the original sequence adding one element (None) that gets paired with the previous last element, something that can be achieved with itertools.izip_longest(). Finally Note that, in Python 3.x, zip() behaves as itertools.izip(), and itertools.izip() is gone.

 The main exe I need to deploy is MyProductFrontDesk.exe, which has a dependency on MyProductSiteServer.exe - and that appears to be where the error is being thrown: "Reference in the manifest does not match the identity of the downloaded assembly MyProductSiteServer.exe." Which manifest needs to be corrected? And how?

I'm looking for a Unix/Linux solution, even better if using the command-line. If possible, using ImageMagick (convert tool).

@TITLE:JSON or SOAP (XML)?
@CONTENT:I'm developing a new application for the company. The application have to exchange data from and to iPhone. Company server side uses .NET framework. For example: the class "Customer" (Name, Address etc..) for a specific CustomerNumber should be first downloaded from server to iphone, stored locally and then uploaded back to apply changes (and make them available to other people). Concurrency should not be a problem (at least at this time...) In any case I have to develop both the server side (webservice or whatever) and the iPhone app. I'm free to identify the best way to do that (this is the application "number ONE" so it will become the "standard" for the future). So, what do you suggest me ? Use SOAP web services (XML parsing etc..) or user JSON ? (it seems lighter...) Is it clear to me how to "upload" data using SOAP (very long to code the xml soap envelope ... I would avoid) but how can I do the same using JSON ? The application needs to use date values (for example: last_visit_date etc..) what about date in Json ?

@TITLE:JQuery is waiting for images to load before executing document.ready
@CONTENT:Update: This bug has been confirmed by at least two others. Even if you dont read my full post - if you're reading this and using JQuery 1.3.1 then stop using it if you're relying on any handlers that you want to execute when the DOM is complete but before the page's images have loaded. Update2: Thanks to Tom (user id 20!) for posting the link to the ticket on the jQuery bug tracker. Update3 - 2009/01/28: The issue has been properly resolved (for those for whom reverting to 1.2.6 is not an option). For anyone currently using 1.3.1 and needing an immediate fix you can read the accepted answer below for direction. Thanks John. I just upgraded to JQuery 1.3.1, and it took me several hours to realize that my beloved $(function( ) {  ... }
 syntax was now waiting for the entire page to load (including images) before executing the function body. I was seeing strange behavior when trying to integrate Yahoo's menus. (Fortunately I had some slow loading images on my page which made me aware of the problem)! I made a test file becasue I figured something more complex was going on, but I still had the same symptoms even with this simple file. <head>
   <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>   
   <script>
    $(function() {    
      alert("Ready"); 
    });
  </script>
</head>

<body>      
  <img src="<PATH_TO_DYNAMIC_IMAGE>_1.jpg" />
  <img src="<PATH_TO_DYNAMIC_IMAGE>_2.jpg" />
  <img src="<PATH_TO_DYNAMIC_IMAGE>_3.jpg" />
  <img src="<PATH_TO_DYNAMIC_IMAGE>_4.jpg" />       
</body>
 Different versions of JQuery had different results: What happens in version 1.2.6 is that alert box is shown instantly and then I see the images loading behind it (expected and documented behavior). What happens in version 1.3.1 is that the images all load and only then will the alert box be shown. Whats going on! Is this a new feature (I cant imagine why) or a bug? Important: This only seems to be an issue in IE and not firefox Sorry I dont have a dynamic image file that is publically accessible to make it easier for others to see this. If you want to test it out I suggest using a large image file picked randomly from google images and clear your cache.

@TITLE:What is the value of the css 'ex' unit?
@CONTENT:(Not to be confused with Xunit, a popular .Net unit testing library.) Today in a fit of boredom I started inspecting Gmails DOM (yes, I was very bored). Everything looked pretty straightforward until I noticed an interesting specification on the widths of certain elements. The illustrious Googlites had specified a number of table cols using the rare 'ex' unit. width: 22ex;
 At first I was stumped ("what's an 'ex'?"), then it came back to me: I seem to remember something from years ago when first I was learning about CSS. From the CSS3 spec: [The ex unit is] equal to the used x-height of the first available font. The x-height is so called because it is often equal to the height of the lowercase "x". However, an ¡¥ex¡¦ is defined even for fonts that do not contain an "x". Well and good. But I've never actually seen it used before (much less used it myself). I use ems quite commonly, and appreciate their value, but why the "ex"? It seems much less standard a measurement than the em, and far less useful. One of the few pages I found discussing this topic is Stephen Poley's http://www.xs4all.nl/~sbpoley/webmatters/emex.html. Stephen makes good points, however, his discussion seems inconclusive to me. So my question is: What value does the 'ex' unit lend to web design? (This question could be tagged subjective, but I'll leave that decision to more experienced SO'ers than myself.)

@TITLE:How to set cache: false in jQuery.get call
@CONTENT:jQuery.get() is a shorthand for jQuery.ajax() with a get call. But when I set cache:false in the data of the .get() call, what is sent to the server is a parameter called cache with a value of false. While my intention is to send a timestamp with the data to the server to prevent caching which is what happens if I use cache: false in jQuery.ajax data. How do I accomplish this without rewriting my jQuery.get calls to jQuery.ajax calls or using $.ajaxSetup({
    // Disable caching of AJAX responses
    cache: false
});
 update: Thanks everyone for the answers. You are all correct. However, I was hoping that there was a way to let the get call know that you do not want to cache, or send that value to the underlying .ajax() so it would know what to do with it. I a. looking for a fourth way other than the three ways that have been identified so far: Doing it globally via ajaxSetup Using a .ajax call instead of a .get call Doing it manually by adding a new parameter holding a timestamp to your .get call. I just thought that this capability should be built into the .get call.

@TITLE:C# 5 Async/Await - is it *concurrent*?
@CONTENT:I've been considering the new async stuff in C# 5, and one particular question came up. I understand that the await keyword is a neat compiler trick/syntactic sugar to implement continuation passing, where the remainder of the method is broken up into Task objects and queued-up to be run in order, but where control is returned to the calling method. My problem is that I've heard that currently this is all on a single thread. Does this mean that this async stuff is really just a way of turning continuation code into Task objects and then calling Application.DoEvents() after each task completes before starting the next one? Or am I missing something? (This part of the question is rhetorical - I'm fully aware I'm missing something :) ) Many thanks in advance.

 Basically I have a superView, and sibling subviews A and B. B has the same frame as A, hence hiding A completely. Now my requirement is this. SubView B should receive all swipe and tap (single and double) gestures. SubView A should receive all pinch gestures. This is how I added gesture recognizers to the views UISwipeGestureRecognizer *leftSwipe  =  [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(leftSwipe:)];
[leftSwipe setDirection:(UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft)];
leftSwipe.delegate  =   self;
[bView addGestureRecognizer:leftSwipe];
[leftSwipe release];

UISwipeGestureRecognizer *rightSwipe  =  [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(rightSwipe:)];
[rightSwipe setDirection:(UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionRight)];
rightSwipe.delegate   =   self;
[bView addGestureRecognizer:rightSwipe];
[rightSwipe release];

UIPinchGestureRecognizer *pinch   =  [[UIPinchGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handlePinch:)];
pinch.delegate    =   self;
[aView addGestureRecognizer:pinch];
[pinch release];
 I did some research and to me UIGestureRecognizerDelegate looked promising and I implemented the delegate method - (BOOL)gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer
 I returned NO for SubView B, hoping that underlying view will get these event. No such luck though - (BOOL)gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer{
    if ([gestureRecognizer isKindOfClass:[UIPinchGestureRecognizer class]] && [gestureRecognizer view] == bView) {
        NSLog(@"pinchGesture");
        //bView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
        return NO;
    }
    return YES;
}
 Then I disabled user interaction of SubView B inside the delegate callback (commented code in above block), when pinch gesture is recognized, hoping remaining part of gesture will be received by SubView A. No such luck there too.. So that is where I stand now. I have seen this question, where the accepted answer involves property cancelsTouchesInView. But I believe cancelsTouchesInView only cancel a particular touch event, do not forward it. Any other way to achieve my requirement? I am ready to work on whatever hint you provide. EDIT : BOUNTY TIME My so called subView A is actually an instance of a 3rd party library's View class, which takes all touches away and I don't have any control over any gestures on it. I want different implementation for left and right swipe and I want pinch, tap etc work just like it is working with this third party view. So I put a view on top of A (SubView B) to get left and right swipes. But now I want to forward other gesture events to underlying library.

@TITLE:How can I programmatically check (parse) the validity of a TSQL statement?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make my integration tests more idempotent. One idea was to execute rollback after every test, the other idea was to some how programatically parse the text, similar to the green check box in Query Analyzer or SSMS. How do I get SQL Server to parse my command without running it using ADO.NET? UPDATE: This is what finally worked as desired: using (DbCommand executeOnly = Factory.DbCommand())
{
    executeOnly.Connection = command.Connection;
    executeOnly.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
    executeOnly.CommandText = "SET NOEXEC ON;";
    executeOnly.Connection.Open();
    executeOnly.ExecuteNonQuery();
}
//set more properties of command.
command.Execute();
 For inexplicable reasons, "SET PARSEONLY ON" only worked in Query Analyzer. I couldn't set this on an ADO.NET connection. It is just as well because PARSEONLY seems to catch only syntax errors, which isn't a common error. SET NOEXEC ON will catch a wider varieties of errors, such as a view that references a missing table or column or a missing parameter in a stored procedure.
@CODE:using (DbCommand executeOnly = Factory.DbCommand())
{
    executeOnly.Connection = command.Connection;
    executeOnly.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
    executeOnly.CommandText = "SET NOEXEC ON;";
    executeOnly.Connection.Open();
    executeOnly.ExecuteNonQuery();
}
//set more properties of command.

@TITLE:How do I programmatically retrieve SQL Server stored procedure source that is identical to the source returned by the SQL Server Management Studio gui?
@CONTENT:Any pointers on how I can programmatically get exactly the identical stored procedure source from SQL Server 2005, as when I right-click on that stored procedure in SQL Server Management Studio and select modify? I'm trying using SMO, but there are some textual differences. The procedure always has CREATE, not ALTER, and there are some differences in the header, such as missing GOs in the version I'm getting programmatically. I can fix these up, but perhaps there is a better way? Again, I'm in SQL Server 2005, using SMSE. Using SMO via Visual Studio 8 2008. Thanks! Update: Gotten some answers that tell the basics of how to retrieve the stored procedure. What I'm looking for is retrieving the text identical (or nearly identical) to what the GUI generates. Example: for sp_mysp, right-click in Management Studio, select modify. This generates:     USE [MY_DB]  
    GO  
    /****** Object:  StoredProcedure [dbo].[sp_mysp]    Script Date: 01/21/2009 17:43:18 ******/

    -- Author:  	
    -- Create date:

    ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_mysp]
 I'd like to programmatically get the same thing (notice the GOs in the header, and the fact that it's an ALTER PROCEDURE. Ideally, I'd like to get this with minimal programmatic fixing up of the source retrieved. I'd be happy to only get something that differed in the Script Date details . . .

 The problem I'm having is that sometimes a scientist goes back and corrects observations -- not by editing the erroneous rows, but by appending a duplicate row to the end of a file. Simple example of such a case is illustrated below: import pandas 
import datetime
startdate = datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1, 0, 0)
enddate = datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1, 5, 0)
index = pandas.DatetimeIndex(start=startdate, end=enddate, freq='H')
data = {'A' : range(6), 'B' : range(6)}
data1 = {'A' : [20, -30, 40], 'B' : [-50, 60, -70]}
df1 = pandas.DataFrame(data=data, index=index)
df2 = pandas.DataFrame(data=data1, index=index[:3])
df3 = df1.append(df2)
df3
                       A   B
2001-01-01 00:00:00   20 -50
2001-01-01 01:00:00  -30  60
2001-01-01 02:00:00   40 -70

2001-01-01 01:00:00    1   1
2001-01-01 02:00:00    2   2
 And so I need df3 to evenutally become:                        A   B
2001-01-01 00:00:00    0   0

 I thought that adding a column of row numbers (df3['rownum'] = range(df3.shape[0])) would help me select out the bottom-most row for any value of the DatetimeIndex, but I am stuck on figuring out the group_by or pivot (or ???) statements to make that work.

@CONTENT:I've read a couple of things about MVCs but I still don't understand when they should be used and when they shouldn't be used. I am looking for clear examples that say things like "if you're developing this then you should use MVC, like this" and "if you're developing this, you shouldn't use MVC." Most of the examples I've seen rely on complex frameworks which have already implemented everything and you have to learn the framework and use it a lot to understand what's really happening. To many programmers, phrasings such as "UI business logic" sound like marketing terms ¡X for example, the words "Instead the View binds directly to a Presentation Model" are used in this post. I am aware of the dangers that may lurk in the shadows as MVC is a concept and everyone feels like they know it best, yet nobody really knows exactly how to use it because there may be a lot of variables involved and everyone is allowed to have a different perspective on how to dissect a project into the Model, the View and the Controller. There is a lot of theory out there but very few clear examples. What I'm looking for are not "the best" ways of doing it so this should not be considered as subjective; I'm looking for different simple implementations that would allow me to decide on my own which are the best approaches. Succinctly: What are good on-line resources that present pro and con arguments to using MVC in various situations and provide clear examples to help the reader understand the concept?

 I can always just do multiple full-match greps, or do some outside (non-R) processing, but I was hoping I can do it all within R. Is there's a function or a package that provides such a function to do this?
@CODE:grep grepl regexpr gregexpr sub gsub \((.*?) :: (0\.[0-9]+)\)

@TITLE:Fragment design: Adapting to multiple screen layouts by showing/hiding fragments within a single Activity?
@CONTENT:I am trying to understand how to use Fragments to create apps that adapt well to multiple screens and layouts. I have studied a few examples: The Fragments document on Android Developer guide. Google IO app Fragments sample from ActionBar Sherlock. All of these advocate a multiple Activity approach: On a large screen, display a single Activity with multiple Fragments On a smaller screen, split up the Fragments among multiple Activitys. I thought of another approach - a single Activity one: Have a single Activity with all the Fragments in it. Depending on the screen size and orientation, show/hide the appropriate Fragment(s) (using FragmentTransaction.show() / FragmentTransaction.hide()) . To illustrate with the same "News article list/article contents" example that Android developer guide uses: Have the News activity containing both an ArticleListFragment and ArticleReaderFragment. On a tab, both fragments are always displayed. On a phone, the ArticleReaderFragment is initially hidden. When an article is selected from the list, the ArticleListFragment is hidden and the ArticleReaderFragment is shown. Has anybody used a similar approach? Are there any practical downsides this method might have? Does it seem better/worse compared to the multiple-activity way? For example, fragments cannot be shown/hidden in XML - one must use FragmentTransaction for this. EDIT 1: Description of a Hypothetical Scenario Imagine an app which can display up to three "panes" at a time on the screen. Further, these are the factors to consider: A phone can display only one pane at a time (regardless of portrait/landscape orientation) A 7-inch tablet can display 2 panes, split vertically in Portrait, and split horizontally in landscape mode. A 10+ inch tablet can display 2 panes, split vertically in Portrait; 3 panes split horizontally in landscape. For simplicity, lets keep TV screens out of the discussion. Now, translating this to design: We have three fragments: Frag1, Frag2 and Frag3. In the simplest case, All three fragments are in a single Activity (lets call it ActivityA). This is the 10-inch, landscape case. The other "simple" case is when each Fragment is in its own Activity - ActivityA contains Frag1; ActivityB contains Frag2 and ActivityC contains Frag3. So far, we have not considered anything which is significantly different from the News Reader example presented in the Android developer guide. The only major difference is having three fragments instead of two. Now, the case of 7-inch tabs which can accommodate only 2 fragments. How would this work? Note that there are two combinations possible here: Frag1 and Frag2 are being displayed. Frag2 and Frag3 are being displayed. I'm just unable to wrap my head around this. Do I do all of this within ActivityA? Do I just create an altogether new ActivityD? How many layouts would I need to create (I counted around 8)? Isn't it too many permuations? I do realize that the single-activity approach I proposed above might also not be a good fit for this scenario - since showing/hiding fragments in itself is non-trivial. Any suggestions on how to handle this without getting overwhelmed with layouts and combinations?
@CODE:Activity Activity Fragment Fragment Activity Activity Activity Fragment Fragment FragmentTransaction.show() FragmentTransaction.hide() News ArticleListFragment ArticleReaderFragment ArticleReaderFragment ArticleListFragment ArticleReaderFragment FragmentTransaction

@TITLE:Tool or library for comparing xml files [closed]
@CONTENT:I am looking for an XML comparing tool that understands xml. It cannot be a line by line comparision like WinMerge or Beyond Compare. An ideal solution would be one that shows changes similar to the way Word 2007 shows track changes. DeltaXML does this, but does not come with a real GUI 'out of the box' and is $500 per user!: ExamXml works out of the box but displays the differences in a confusing manner. It does not have a concept of before and after, it just shows the differences: The tool should have the concept of using attributes as a key, so that it does not think that a reordered list of elements has changed. DeltaXML does this but I failed to set it up correctly for the screen shot. UPDATE: So far ExamlXML is the best out of the box solution. But it lacks the change management concepts of DeltaXML. Resulting in some usability problems. DeltaXML is pretty much the solution I need, but something with more functionality out of the box would be better. DeltaXML requires writing java code to call the api, along with writing XSL to transform the xml into the expected input.

            break;

    }
}
 Or is it acceptable to do this (with no lock): while(!_cancelled & operationNotComplete)
{
    // Do complex operation
}
 Or what about marking the _cancelled variable as volatile. Is that necessary? [I know there is the BackgroundWorker class with it's inbuilt CancelAsync() method, but I'm interested in the semantics and use of locking and threaded variable access here, not the specific implementation, the code is just an example.] There seems to be two theories. 1) Because it is a simple inbuilt type (and access to inbuilt types is atomic in .net) and because we are only writing to it in one place and only reading on the background thread there is no need to lock or mark as volatile. 2) You should mark it as volatile because if you don't the compiler may optimise out the read in the while loop because it thinks nothing it capable of modifying the value. Which is the correct technique? (And why?) [Edit: There seem to be two clearly defined and opposing schools of thought on this. I am looking for a definitive answer on this so please if possible post your reasons and cite your sources along with your answer.]
@CODE:private bool _cancelled;

private void CancelButton_Click(Object sender ClickEventArgs e)
{
    _cancelled = true;
} while(operationNotComplete)
{
    // Do complex operation

@TITLE:How to make scipy.interpolate give an extrapolated result beyond the input range?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to port a program which uses a hand-rolled interpolator (developed by a mathematician colleage) over to use the interpolators provided by scipy. I'd like to use or wrap the scipy interpolator so that it has as close as possible behavior to the old interpolator. A key difference between the two functions is that in our original interpolator - if the input value is above or below the input range, our original interpolator will extrapolate the result. If you try this with the scipy interpolator it raises a ValueError. Consider this program as an example: import numpy as np
from scipy import interpolate

x = np.arange(0,10)
y = np.exp(-x/3.0)
f = interpolate.interp1d(x, y)

print f(9)
print f(11) # Causes ValueError, because it's greater than max(x)
 Is there a sensible way to make it so that instead of crashing, the final line will simply do a linear extrapolate, continuing the gradients defined by the first and last two points to infinity. Note, that in the real software I'm not actually using the exp function - that's here for illustration only!
@CODE:ValueError import numpy as np
from scipy import interpolate

x = np.arange(0,10)
y = np.exp(-x/3.0)

 I would like to add various calculated columns, starting with simple ones such as period Range (H-L) and then booleans to indicate the occurrence of price patterns that I will define - e.g. a hammer candle pattern, for which a sample definition: def closed_in_top_half_of_range(h,l,c):
    return c > l + (h-1)/2

def lower_wick(o,l,c):

    and closed_in_top_half_of_range(row["High"],row["Low"],row["Close"])
 Basic problem: how do I map the function to the column, specifically where I would like to reference more than one other column or the whole row or whatever? This post deals with adding two calculated columns off of a single source column, which is close, but not quite it. And slightly more advanced: for price patterns that are determined with reference to more than a single bar (T), how can I reference different rows (e.g. T-1, T-2 etc.) from within the function definition? Many thanks in advance.

The proponents of this approach to IO argue that this makes IO operations pure, as in referentially transparent. Why is that?

Also, isn't it possible to describe pretty much any non-pure function like a function of the real world? For example, can't we think of, say, C's malloc as being a function that takes a RealWorld and an Int and returns a pointer and a RealWorld, only just like in the IO monad the RealWorld is implicit?

@TITLE:$.ajax( { async : false } ) request is still firing asynchronously?
@CONTENT:I got a little problem here guys. I'm trying to implement the following scenario: A user opens the home page and sees a list of other users and clicks to add one to his friend list. I issue an Ajax request to a server resource to validate if the user is logged in, if so, I issue another ajax request to another server resource to actually add it to the user's friend list. Sounds simple? Here's what I've done: I created a function isLoggedIn that will issue the first request to the server in order to determine if the user is logged in. I issue this request using jQuery.ajax method. Here's my function looks like: function isLoggedIn() {

    $.ajax({
    async: "false",
        type: "GET",
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        dataType: "json",
        url: "/isloggedin",
        success: function(jsonData) {
            alert("jsonData =" + jsonData.LoggedIn);
            return jsonData.LoggedIn;
        }
    });
}
 The returned JSON is very simple, it looks like the following: { LoggedIn: true } or { LoggedIn : false } 
 Now this method, actually works and displays the alert correctly: JsonData = true if logged in, and JsonData = false if not logged in. Up to this point there's no problem, the problem occurs when I try to call this method: I call it like so: $(".friend_set .img").click(function() {
    debugger;
    if (isLoggedIn()) { 

        alert("alredy logged in");
        trackAsync();
        popupNum = 6;
    }
    else {
        alert("not logged in"); //always displays this message.
        popupNum = 1;
    }
    //centering with css

    centerPopup(popupNum);
    //load popup
    loadPopup(popupNum);
    return false;

});
 Calling isLoggedIn always returns false, and it returns false before the ajax request finishes (because the messagejsonData = trueis displayed after the message "not logged in". I made sure that the request is **NOT** Asynchronous by statingasync: false`! Apparently it's still working asynchronously, though. What am I missing here guys?
@CODE:isLoggedIn jQuery.ajax function isLoggedIn() {

    $.ajax({
    async: "false",
        type: "GET",
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        dataType: "json",
        url: "/isloggedin",
        success: function(jsonData) {
            alert("jsonData =" + jsonData.LoggedIn);
            return jsonData.LoggedIn;
        }
    });
} { LoggedIn: true } or { LoggedIn : false } JsonData = true JsonData = false $(".friend_set .img").click(function() {
    debugger;
    if (isLoggedIn()) { 

        alert("alredy logged in");

    }
    //centering with css

    centerPopup(popupNum);
    //load popup
    loadPopup(popupNum);
    return false;

}); isLoggedIn false false before the ajax request finishes (because the message is displayed after the message "not logged in". I made sure that the request is **NOT** Asynchronous by stating { async: "false" } { async : false }

@TITLE:Where to store sensitive data in public rails app?
@CONTENT:My personal rails project uses a few API's for which I store the API keys/secrets in config/environments/production.yml and development.yml as global variables. I now want to push this project to github for others to use, but I don't want them to have those bits of sensitive data. I also don't want this file in .gitignore because it's required for the app to run. I've considered putting them in the DB somewhere, but am hoping to find a better solution.

@TITLE:Rails Polymorphic Association with multiple associations on the same model
@CONTENT:My question is essentially the same as this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1168047/polymorphic-association-with-multiple-associations-on-the-same-model However, the proposed/accepted solution does not work, as illustrated by a commenter later. I have a Photo class that is used all over my app. A post can have a single photo. However, I want to re-use the polymorphic relationship to add a secondary photo. Before: class Photo 
   belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
end

class Post
   has_one :photo, :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
end
 Desired: class Photo 
   belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
end

class Post
   has_one :photo,           :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
   has_one :secondary_photo, :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
end
 However, this fails as it cannot find the class "SecondaryPhoto". Based on what I could tell from that other thread, I'd want to do:    has_one :secondary_photo, :as => :attachable, :class_name => "Photo", :dependent => :destroy
 Except calling Post#secondary_photo simply returns the same photo that is attached via the Photo association, e.g. Post#photo === Post#secondary_photo. Looking at the SQL, it does WHERE type = "Photo" instead of, say, "SecondaryPhoto" as I'd like... Thoughts? Thanks!
@CODE:class Photo 
   belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
end

class Post
   has_one :photo, :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
end class Photo 
   belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
end

class Post
   has_one :photo,           :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
   has_one :secondary_photo, :as => :attachable, :dependent => :destroy
end has_one :secondary_photo, :as => :attachable, :class_name => "Photo", :dependent => :destroy

@LINK:/questions/19227036/testing-directives-that-require-controllers
@TITLE:Testing directives that require controllers
@CONTENT:So I did see another question: How to mock required directive controller in directive UT which is basically my problem but it seems the answer to this thread was "change your design." I wanted to make sure there is no way to do this. I have a directive that declares a controller which is used by children directives. I am now trying to write jasmine tests for the children directive but I cant get them to compile in the tests because they are dependent on the controller. Here is what it looks like: addressModule.directive('address', ['$http', function($http){
        return {
            replace: false,
            restrict: 'A',
            scope: {
                config: '='
            },
            template:   '<div id="addressContainer">' +
                            '<div ng-if="!showAddressSelectionPage" basic-address config="config"/>' +
                            '<div ng-if="showAddressSelectionPage" address-selector addresses="standardizedAddresses"/>' +
                        '</div>',
            controller: function($scope)
            {
                this.showAddressInput = function(){
                    $scope.showAddressSelectionPage = false;
                };

                this.showAddressSelection = function(){
                    $scope.getStandardizedAddresses();
                };

                this.finish = function(){
                    $scope.finishAddress();
                };
            },
            link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
              ...
            }
       }
}])
 child directive: addressModule.directive('basicAddress360', ['translationService', function(translationService){
        return {
            replace: true,
            restrict: 'A',
            scope: {
                config: '='
            },
            template:
                '...',
            require: "^address360",
            link: function(scope, element, attrs, addressController){
            ...
            }
       }
}])
 jasmine test: it("should do something", inject(function($compile, $rootScope){
            parentHtml = '<div address/>';
            subDirectiveHtml = '<div basic-address>';

            parentElement = $compile(parentHtml)(rootScope);
            parentScope = parentElement.scope();
            directiveElement = $compile(subDirectiveHtml)(parentScope);
            directiveScope = directiveElement.scope();
            $rootScope.$digest();
}));
 Is there no way for me to test the sub directive with jasmine and if so, what am I missing? Even if I could test the directive itself without the controller functions I would be happy.

@TITLE:Rails - passing parameters in link_to
@CONTENT:My Accounts index page lists all accounts, and per account has a link to "+ Service"; this should direct the user to the /my_services/new page and have pre-populated the account_id field with the appropriate ID, depending on which link was clicked on the Accounts index page. I have debug(params) at the bottom of every page, and with what I'm trying, I'm not getting anything other than :controller and :action showing up in my parameters for the /my_services/new page. The link I've been trying is this: link_to "+ Service", "my_services/new", :account_id => acct.id
 I then also have logic in the services controller: def new
  @my_service = MyService.new
  if params[:account_id]
    @my_service.account_id = params[:account_id]
  end
end
 Can someone help with the proper way of doing this? I haven't yet been able to get it going with with a few nasty little hacky things I tried.

My routes.rb for this part now looks like this: resources :accounts, shallow: true do
  resources :services
end
 My links now look like this: <%= link_to "+ Service", new_service_path(:service => { :account_id => @account.id } ) %>

@TITLE:Token Based Authentication in Django
@CONTENT:I am trying to figure out the best way to implement token based authentication in my django app. An external, non-django application is setting a cookie, with a token, and I have a webservice that can retrieve user information based off of that token. If the user has the cookie set, they should not need to authenticate on my site and should be automatically logged in based on the info passed back by the web service. As I see it, there are a few different options to perform the actual check and I'm not sure which is best: Write a custom decorator like the one in this snippet and use it instead of login_required. Call a custom authenticate method inside base_site through an ajax call. On every page, a check would be made and if the cookie exists and is valid, then the user would be automatically logged in. Add some javascript to the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL page that will check/validate the cookie in an ajax call, and automatically redirect back to the referrer if the cookie authenticated. Is there an option I am missing? Ideally, there would be a way to build this into login_required, without having to write a custom decorator.

@CONTENT:I'm running into a strange problem that I haven't run into before. When you do cmd+U to run your Unit Tests (OCUnit for example) does it actually call the main.m, new up the appDelegate and run the app as if your had pressed cmd+R? I only ask because I'm using CoreData behind this DataLayer. I'm mocking out the DataLayer successfully in my tests, but once I implemented a getAll method that is actually calling CoreData, the app/xcode is throwing an exception about the managed object model can't be nil. Which I understand, but I'm not meaning to actually new up the DataLayer class, and I've put a break point in my mainviewcontroller loadView method where it is calling the DataLayer getAll method. It shouldn't matter with tests because this is a mock object, but it's apparently calling the real instance. So back to my question, when pressing cmd+U does it also run the app first then run the tests?

I'm trying to duplicate this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ICS_Structure.PNG as faithfully as I can. The bottom part of that graph all flows top to bottom and I've got that working fine. What I have not been able to do is place the first 3 children right below "Incident Commander". They branch left and right. Plus note how the edges are shared in the top 8 nodes.

@TITLE:ExtJS 4: Models with Associations and Stores
@CONTENT:Introduction I'm facing an application design problem with the Ext.data.Model class in ExtJS. I will try to develop my ideas to a very common online store scenario here, so you can follow me. I would really appreciate any comments on my thoughts and conclusions! Models Let's suppose you want to map the fact that "Every customer can order multiple products" to ExtJS. From the bare words one can identify these three models involved: Customer, Order, and Product. The Order in this case is what connects Customers and Products. Associations I found that ExtJS actually allows you to specify this (Customer)1-n(Order)1-n(Product) relation using the Ext.data.HasManyAssociation and Ext.data.BelongsToAssociation classes. But is this what one wants? Would you want to that a Product always belongs to an Order? What if you want to have a list of Products without any connection to Orders whatsoever? Stores This is where it get's more ExtJS specific. In ExtJS you have Ext.data.Stores to hold all your data. To me a natural way to organize my data is to have an Ext.data.Store for each of my models: CustomerStore OrderStore ProductStore Consider having a three Ext.grid.Panels side-by-side; one for each store. When selecting a customer in the one grid, his orders automatically show up in the second grid. When selecting an order in the second grid the associated products appear in the third grid. Does this sound natural to you? If not, please comment! Bringing it all together So now we have three things that we need to bring together: Models and their Associations (hasMany, belongsTo) and the Data (Stores) Is it possible to define an association only from one side of a Model-Model relation? For instance, can I specify that an Order hasMany Products but leave out that a Product belongsTo an Order? Because a Product can actually belong to more than one Order. Therefore I specify that the Product model hasMany Orders below. Here are the models in ExtJS: Customer Ext.define('Customer', {
    extend   : 'Ext.data.Model',
    requires : [
        'Order',
    ],
    fields   : [
           {name : 'id',          type : 'int'},
           {name : 'lastname',    type : 'string'}
           {name : 'firstname',   type : 'string'}
    ],
    hasMany: 'Order' /* Generates a orders() method on every Customer instance */
});
 Order Ext.define('Order', {
    extend   : 'Ext.data.Model',
    fields   : [
            {name : 'id',          type : 'int'},
            {name : 'customer_id', type : 'int'}, /* refers to the customer that this order belongs to*/
            {name : 'date',        type : 'date'}
    ],
    belongsTo: 'Customer', /* Generates a getCustomer method on every Order instance */
    hasMany: 'Product' /* Generates a products() method on every Order instance */
});
 Product Ext.define('Product', {
    extend   : 'Ext.data.Model',
    fields   : [
            {name : 'id',          type : 'int'},
            {name : 'name',        type : 'string'},
            {name : 'description', type : 'string'},
            {name : 'price',       type : 'float'}
    ],
    /*
        I don't specify the relation to the "Order" model here
        because it simply doesn't belong here.

        Will it still work?
    */
    hasMany: 'Order'
});
 And here are the stores: CustomerStore Ext.define('CustomerStore', {
    extend      : 'Ext.data.Store',
    storeId     : 'CustomerStore',
    model       : 'Customer',
    proxy   : {
        type   : 'ajax',
        url    : 'data/customers.json',
        reader : {
            type           : 'json',
            root           : 'items',
            totalProperty  : 'total'
        }
    }
});
 OrderStore Ext.define('OrderStore', {
    extend      : 'Ext.data.Store',
    storeId     : 'OrderStore',
    model       : 'Order',
    proxy   : {
        type   : 'ajax',
        url    : 'data/orders.json',
        reader : {
            type           : 'json',
            root           : 'items',
            totalProperty  : 'total'
        }
    }
});
 ProductStore Ext.define('ProductStore', {
    extend      : 'Ext.data.Store',
    storeId     : 'ProductStore',
    model       : 'Product',
    proxy   : {
        type   : 'ajax',
        url    : 'data/products.json',
        reader : {

            totalProperty  : 'total'
        }
    }
});
 Here is an example (not by me) with companies and their products http://superdit.com/2011/05/23/extjs-load-grid-from-another-grid/ . It uses two Models and two stores but there are no associations define. Thank you in advance -Konrad

@TITLE:WebSockets over a 3G connection
@CONTENT:I've been playing with Socket.io, node.js and WebSockets, all of which I can get working fine over a wifi connection. However, when I test out a WebSocket-enabled app over a 3G connection (on my iPhone, for example) then it seems like falling back to long polling is the only workable solution. With Socket.io the connection fails with "WebSocket connection invalid or Origin not verified" before falling back to long polling. I don't know if WebSockets are meant to work over 3G - has anyone had success getting them to work like that? I've tried a number of different methods and the all seem to fail, which makes me think that I'm attempting the impossible. Any help greatly appreciated!

@LINK:/questions/19498485/proper-validation-with-mvvm
@TITLE:Proper validation with MVVM
@CONTENT:Warning: Very long and detailed post. Okay, validation in WPF when using MVVM. I¡¦ve read many things now, looked at many SO questions, and tried many approaches, but everything feels somewhat hacky at some point and I¡¦m really not sure how to do it the right way?. Ideally, I want to have all validation happen in the view model using IDataErrorInfo; so that¡¦s what I did. There are however different aspects that make this solution be not a complete solution for the whole validation topic. The situation Let¡¦s take the following simple form. As you can see, it¡¦s nothing fancy. We just have a two textboxes which bind to a string and int property in the view model each. Furthermore we have a button that is bound to an ICommand. So for the validation we now have a two choices: We can run the validation automatically whenever the value of a text box changes. As such the user gets an instant response when he entered something invalid. We can take this one step further to disable the button when there are any errors. Or we can run the validation only explicitly when the button is pressed, then showing all errors if applicable. Obviously we can¡¦t disable the button on errors here. Ideally, I want to implement choice 1. For normal data bindings with activated ValidatesOnDataErrors this is default behavior. So when the text changes, the binding updates the source and triggers the IDataErrorInfo validation for that property; errors are reported back the view. So far so good. Validation status in the view model The interesting bit is to let the view model, or the button in this case, know if there are any errors. The way IDataErrorInfo works, it is mainly there to report errors back to the view. So the view can easily see if there are any errors, display them and even show annotations using Validation.Errors. Furthermore, validation always happens looking at a single property. So having the view model know when there are any errors, or if the validation succeeded, is tricky. A common solution is to simply trigger the IDataErrorInfo validation for all properties in the view model itself. This is often done using a separate IsValid property. The benefit is that this can also be easily used for disabling the command. The drawback is that this might run the validation on all properties a bit too often, but most validations should be simply enough to not hurt the performance. Another solution would be to remember which properties produced errors using the validation and only check those, but that seems a bit overcomplicated and unnecessary for most times. The bottom line is that this could work fine. IDataErrorInfo provides the validation for all properties, and we can simply use that interface in the view model itself to run the validation there too for the whole object. Introducing the problem: Binding exceptions The view model uses actual types for its properties. So in our example, the integer property is an actual int. The text box used in the view however natively only supports text. So when binding to the int in the view model, the data binding engine will automatically perform type conversions¡Xor at least it will try. If you can enter text in a text box meant for numbers, the chances are high that there won¡¦t always be valid numbers inside: So the data binding engine will fail to convert and throw a FormatException. On the view side, we can easily see that. Exceptions from the binding engine are automatically caught by WPF and are displayed as errors¡Xthere isn¡¦t even a need to enable Binding.ValidatesOnExceptions which would be required for exceptions thrown in the setter. The error messages do have a generic text though, so that could be a problem. I have solved this for myself by using a Binding.UpdateSourceExceptionFilter handler, inspecting the exception being thrown and looking at the source property and then generating a less generic error message instead. All that capsulated away into my own Binding markup extension, so I can have all the defaults I need. So the view is fine. The user makes an error, sees some error feedback and can correct it. The view model however is lost. As the binding engine threw the exception, the source was never updated. So the view model is still on the old value, which isn¡¦t what¡¦s being displayed to the user, and the IDataErrorInfo validation obviously doesn¡¦t apply. What¡¦s worse, there is no good way for the view model to know this. At least, I haven¡¦t found a good solution for this yet. What would be possible is to have the view report back to the view model that there was an error. This could be done by data binding the Validation.HasError property back to the view model (which isn¡¦t possible directly), so the view model could check the view¡¦s state first. Another option would be to relay the exception handled in Binding.UpdateSourceExceptionFilter to the view model, so it would be notified of it as well. The view model could even provide some interface for the binding to report these things, allowing for custom error messages instead of generic per-type ones. But that would create a stronger coupling from the view to the view model, which I generally want to avoid. Another ¡§solution¡¨ would be to get rid of all typed properties, use plain string properties and do the conversion in the view model instead. This obviously would move all validation to the view model, but also mean an incredible amount of duplication of things the data binding engine usually takes care of. Furthermore it would change the semantics of the view model. For me, a view is built for the view model and not the reverse¡Xof course the design of the view model depends on what we imagine the view to do, but there¡¦s still general freedom how the view does that. So the view model defines an int property because there is a number; the view can now use a text box (allowing all these problems), or use something that natively works with numbers. So no, changing the types of the properties to string is not an option for me. In the end, this is a problem of the view. The view (and its data binding engine) is responsible for giving the view model proper values to work with. But in this case, there seems to be no good way to tell the view model that it should invalidate the old property value. BindingGroups Binding groups are one way I tried to tackle this. Binding groups have the ability to group all validations, including IDataErrorInfo and thrown exceptions. If available to the view model, they even have a mean to check the validation status for all of those validation sources, for example using CommitEdit. By default, binding groups implement choice 2 from above. They make the bindings update explicitly, essentially adding an additional uncommitted state. So when clicking the button, the command can commit those changes, trigger the source updates and all validations and get a single result if it succeeded. So the command¡¦s action could be this:  if (bindingGroup.CommitEdit())
     SaveEverything();
 CommitEdit will only return true if all validations succeeded. It will take IDataErrorInfo into account and also check binding exceptions. This seems to be a perfect solution for choice 2. The only thing that is a bit of a hassle is managing the binding group with the bindings, but I¡¦ve built myself something that mostly takes care of this (related). If a binding group is present for a binding, the binding will default to an explicit UpdateSourceTrigger. To implement choice 1 from above using binding groups, we basically have to change the trigger. As I have a custom binding extension anyway, this is rather simple, I just set it to LostFocus for all. So now, the bindings will still update whenever a text field changes. If the source could be updated (binding engine throws no exception) then IDataErrorInfo will run as usual. If it couldn¡¦t be updated the view is still able to see it. And if we click our button, the underlying command can call CommitEdit (although nothing needs to be committed) and get the total validation result to see if it can continue. We might not be able to disable the button easily this way. At least not from the view model. Checking the validation over and over is not really a good idea just to update the command status, and the view model isn¡¦t notified when a binding engine exception is thrown anyway (which should disable the button then)¡Xor when it goes away to enable the button again. We could still add a trigger to disable the button in the view using the Validation.HasError so it¡¦s not impossible. Solution? So overall, this seems to be the perfect solution. What is my problem with it though? To be honest, I¡¦m not entirely sure. Binding groups are a complex thing that seem to be usually used in smaller groups, possibly having multiple binding groups in a single view. By using one big binding group for the whole view just to ensure my validation, it feels as if I¡¦m abusing it. And I just keep thinking, that there must be a better way to solve this whole situation, because surely I can¡¦t be the only one having these problems. And so far I haven¡¦t really seen many people use binding groups for validation with MVVM at all, so it just feels odd. So, what exactly is the proper way to do validation in WPF with MVVM while being able to check for binding engine exceptions? My solution (/hack) First of all, thanks for your input! As I have written above, I¡¦m using IDataErrorInfo already to do my data validation and I personally believe it¡¦s the most comfortable utility to do the validation job. I¡¦m using utilities similar to what Sheridan suggested in his answer below, so maintaining works fine too. In the end, my problem boiled down to the binding exception issue, where the view model just wouldn¡¦t know about when it happened. While I could handle this with binding groups as detailed above, I still decided against it, as I just didn¡¦t feel all that comfortable with it. So what did I do instead? As I mentioned above, I detect binding exceptions on the view-side by listening to a binding¡¦s UpdateSourceExceptionFilter. In there, I can get a reference to the view model from the binding expression¡¦s DataItem. I then have an interface IReceivesBindingErrorInformation which registers the view model as a possible receiver for information about binding errors. I then use that to pass the binding path and the exception to the view model: object OnUpdateSourceExceptionFilter(object bindExpression, Exception exception)
{
    BindingExpression expr = (bindExpression as BindingExpression);
    if (expr.DataItem is IReceivesBindingErrorInformation)
    {
        ((IReceivesBindingErrorInformation)expr.DataItem).ReceiveBindingErrorInformation(expr.ParentBinding.Path.Path, exception);
    }

    // check for FormatException and produce a nicer error
    // ...
 }
 In the view model I then remember whenever I am notified about a path¡¦s binding expression: HashSet<string> bindingErrors = new HashSet<string>();
void IReceivesBindingErrorInformation.ReceiveBindingErrorInformation(string path, Exception exception)
{
    bindingErrors.Add(path);
}
 And whenever the IDataErrorInfo revalidates a property, I know that the binding worked, and I can clear the property from the hash set. In the view model I then can check if the hash set contains any items and abort any action that requires the data to be validated completely. It might not be the nicest solution due to the coupling from the view to the view model, but using that interface it¡¦s at least somewhat less a problem.
@CODE:IDataErrorInfo string int ICommand ValidatesOnDataErrors IDataErrorInfo IDataErrorInfo Validation.Errors IDataErrorInfo IsValid IDataErrorInfo int int FormatException Binding.ValidatesOnExceptions Binding.UpdateSourceExceptionFilter IDataErrorInfo Validation.HasError Binding.UpdateSourceExceptionFilter string int string IDataErrorInfo CommitEdit if (bindingGroup.CommitEdit())

@TITLE:Simple string parsing with C++
@CONTENT:I've been using C++ for quite a long time now but nevertheless I tend to fall back on scanf when I have to parse simple text files. For example given a config like this (also assuming that the order of the fields could vary): foo: [3 4 5]

 I would write something like: char line[SOME_SIZE];
while (fgets(line, SOME_SIZE, file)) {

If there's a good guide somewhere on sound manipulation on the Android without OpenAL, that's fine too. It's just that OpenAL is sort of a standard for game makers and it would be nice to port my thousands of lines over to this system, which I sort of thought was the point of the NDK before I dugg into it and saw that there's almost no shared library access on the system.

@LINK:/questions/887148/how-to-determine-if-a-string-contains-invalid-encoded-characters
@TITLE:How to determine if a String contains invalid encoded characters
@CONTENT:Usage scenario We have implemented a webservice that our web frontend developers use (via a php api) internally to display product data. On the website the user enters something (i.e. a query string). Internally the web site makes a call to the service via the api. Note: We use restlet, not tomcat Original Problem Firefox 3.0.10 seems to respect the selected encoding in the browser and encode a url according to the selected encoding. This does result in different query strings for ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8. Our web site forwards the input from the user and does not convert it (which it should), so it may make a call to the service via the api calling a webservice using a query string that contains german umlauts. I.e. for a query part looking like     ...v=abc?def
 if "ISO-8859-1" is selected, the sent query part looks like ...v=abc%E4def
 but if "UTF-8" is selected, the sent query part looks like ...v=abc%C3%A4def
 Desired Solution As we control the service, because we've implemented it, we want to check on server side wether the call contains non utf-8 characters, if so, respond with an 4xx http status Current Solution In Detail Check for each character ( == string.substring(i,i+1) ) if character.getBytes()[0] equals 63 for '?' if Character.getType(character.charAt(0)) returns OTHER_SYMBOL Code protected List< String > getNonUnicodeCharacters( String s ) {
  final List< String > result = new ArrayList< String >();
  for ( int i = 0 , n = s.length() ; i < n ; i++ ) {
    final String character = s.substring( i , i + 1 );
    final boolean isOtherSymbol = 
      ( int ) Character.OTHER_SYMBOL
       == Character.getType( character.charAt( 0 ) );
    final boolean isNonUnicode = isOtherSymbol 
      && character.getBytes()[ 0 ] == ( byte ) 63;
    if ( isNonUnicode )
      result.add( character );
  }
  return result;
}
 Question Will this catch all invalid (non utf encoded) characters? Does any of you have a better (easier) solution? Note: I checked URLDecoder with the following code final String[] test = new String[]{
  "v=abc%E4def",
  "v=abc%C3%A4def"
};
for ( int i = 0 , n = test.length ; i < n ; i++ ) {
    System.out.println( java.net.URLDecoder.decode(test[i],"UTF-8") );
    System.out.println( java.net.URLDecoder.decode(test[i],"ISO-8859-1") );
}
 This prints: v=abc?def
v=abc?def
v=abc?def
v=abc??def
 and it does not throw an IllegalArgumentException sigh
@CODE:...v=abc?def ...v=abc%E4def ...v=abc%C3%A4def protected List< String > getNonUnicodeCharacters( String s ) {
  final List< String > result = new ArrayList< String >();

@TITLE:Stopword removal with NLTK
@CONTENT:I am trying to process a user entered text by removing stopwords using nltk toolkit, but with stopword-removal the words like 'and', 'or', 'not' gets removed. I want these words to be present after stopword removal process as they are operators which are required for later processing text as query. I don't know which are the words which can be operators in text query, and I also want to remove unnecessary words from my text.

@TITLE:Need help understanding Oracle's Java on Mac
@CONTENT:I've been using Java on OS X for many, many years and recently when Apple stopped including Java by default I let the OS go and install it for me (Apple's variety, of course). So now I'm using OS X 10.8 and I need to install Java 7 so I just got Oracle's Update 15 in DMG form and ran the installer. It updated my /usr/bin/java (and related files) to point here: /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java
 Tracing this back to '/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions' everything either points to 'Current' or 'CurrentJDK', the former being a link to 'A' (which is Oracle's Java 7, from what I can tell, not sure why it is 'A') and the latter being a link to Apple's Java 6 in '/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk'. Now this is all really confusing but this isn't even my question yet. It appears there is a Java 7 installed here: /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A
 But there is also a Java 7 installed here: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_15.jdk
 Finding 'java' in both and printing out the version yields the same version and build (java version "1.7.0_15"), however, when hashing the files they are different. So does this mean Oracle installed Java 7 in two different places? If so, why? Which am I supposed to use? And why do some things still point to Java 6 (CurrentJDK). I've looked on Oracle's website but nothing there clears anything up.

@LINK:/questions/1756285/stack-size-estimation
@TITLE:Stack Size Estimation
@CONTENT:In multi-threaded embedded software (written in C or C++), a thread must be given enough stack space in order to allow it to complete its operations without overflowing. Correct sizing of the stack is critical in some real-time embedded environments, because (at least in some systems I've worked with), the operating system will NOT detect this for you. Usually, the stack size for a new thread (other than the main thread) is designated at the time that thread is created (i.e. in an argument to pthread_create() or the like). Often, these stack sizes are hard-coded to values that are known to be good at the time the code was originally written or tested. However, future changes to the code often break the assumptions on which the hard-coded stack sizes were based, and one fateful day, your thread enters one of the deeper branches of its call graph and overflows the stack -- bringing down the whole system or silently corrupting memory. I have personally seen this problem in the case where code executed in the thread declares struct instances on the stack. When the struct is augmented to hold additional data, the stack size inflates accordingly, potentially allowing stack overflows to occur. I imagine this could be a huge problem for established codebases where the full effects of adding fields to a structure cannot be known immediately (too many threads/functions to find all the places where that struct is used). Since the usual response to "stack sizing" questions is "they're not portable", let's assume that the compiler, operating system, and processor are all known quantities for this investigation. Let's also assume recursion isn't used, so we're not dealing with the possibility an "infinite recursion" scenario. What are some reliable ways to estimate the necessary stack size for a thread? I'd prefer methods that are offline (static analysis) and automatic, but all ideas are welcome.

@LINK:/questions/1421978/help-troubleshooting-sqlexception-timeout-expired-on-connection-in-a-non-load
@TITLE:Help troubleshooting SqlException: Timeout expired on connection, in a non-load situation
@CONTENT:I have a server hosting a website of mine that has almost zero-traffic. A few people (< 20) enter the site every day, and a few RSS readers are subscribed to some feeds we put out. Almost every night, an RSS reader will hit us in the middle of the night and get an exception that the website can't connect to the SQL Server because of a Timeout in the connection. The details are extremely weird, so I'm looking for some help on what could be the issue, since I don't know where to start looking anymore. We are using ASP.Net MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server 2008 over Windows Server 2008. The machine is a dedicated box we got from a not exactly top-tier provider, so things might be configured non-optimally, or who knows what else. The box is also pretty small, and has only 1Gb RAM, but it should take the kind of load we have for now... I'm copying the full call stack below, but first, some of the things we know: The error always happens when iTunes is querying our site. I believe this should have nothing to do with anything, but the truth is that we only get it from iTunes. My best guess is that this happens because only iTunes queries us at that time of the night when no one else is hitting us. One of our theories is that the SQL Server and IIS are fighting for memory, and one of them is getting paged to disk out of not being used, and when someone "wakes it up", it takes too long to read everything from disk back into memory. Is this something that could potentially happen? (I'm kind of discarding this since it sounds like a design issue in SQL Server if it were possible) I also thought about the possibility that we're leaking connections, since we may not be disposing of EF entities appropriately (see my question here). This is the only thing I could find by Googling the problem. I'm discarding this given the extremely low load we have. This always happens over the night, so it's very likely something related to the fact that nothing happened for a while. For example, I'm pretty sure that when these requests hit, the web server process got recycled and it's starting up / re-JITting everything. The re-JITting doesn't explain the SQL timeout, though. UPDATE: We attached a profiler as suggested, and it took quite a while before we had a new exception. This is the new stuff we know: Having the profiler attached enormously reduced the number of errors we got. In fact, after normally getting several per day, we had to wait for 3 or 4 days for this to happen ONCE. Once we stopped the profiler, it went back to the normal error frequency (or even worse). So the profiler has some effect that hides this problem to some extent, but not completely. Looking at the profiler trace next to the IIS requests log, there is an expected 1-1 correspondence between requests and queries. However, every now and then, I see A LOT of queries being executed that have no correllation at all with the IIS log. In fact, right before the actual bug was logged, I got 750 queries in a period of 3 minutes, all of which were completely unrelated to the IIS logs. The query text look like the kind of unreadable crap that EF generates, and they're not all the same, and they all look just like the queries coming from the website: Same ApplicationName, User, etc. To give an idea how ridiculous this is, the site got about 370 IIS requests that hit the DB, in the course of 2 days These unexplained queries did not come from the same ClientProcessID as the previous website ones, although they may still have come from the website, if the process got recycled in the meantime. There was almost an hour of no activity between the last explained query, and the first unexplained one. One of these long streaks of queries that I don't know where they came from came right before the error I got logged, so I believe this is the clue we should be following. As I expected originally, when the query that threw the error was executed, it came from a different ClientProcessID than the previous one, (8 minutes later than the previous unexplained one, and almost exactly one hour later than the previous IIS one). This means, to me, that the worker process had indeed gotten recycled. This is something I absolutely don't understand. The IIS log shows that one minute before the error requests, 4 were perfectly served, although the queries for those don't show up in the trace at all. In fact, after those 4 that went well, I had 4 exceptions thrown in quick succession, those 4 ALSO don't show up in the trace (which makes sense since if there was a Timeout in connection the query should have never gotten executed, but I don't see the connections attempts in the trace either) So, in short, I'm completely clueless about this. I can't find a reason for those hundreds of queries that get run in quick succession, but I believe those must have something to do with the problem. I also don't know how to diagnose the connection problems... Or how the Profiler trace may be missing some queries that according to IIS went through fine... Any ideas?

@TITLE:How to use command line msbuild to deploy VS2012 Web Site project without precompiling it?
@CONTENT:I've inherited a very large VS2012 web site project (not web application) and am trying to automate it's deployment. There are tons of circular references in the project so to get it to precompile using aspnet_compiler.exe I have to turn on fixednames. The problem with that is it causes the build to take about 20 minutes on my quad core, 16gb ram, ssd developer machine. The previous developer didn't have to deal with this as he would just copy the whole source to the production web server. So before I tackle the circular references issue I want to at least automatically deploy the project using msdeploy. I can use the publish profiles within visual studio and it does exactly what I want: Builds the referenced DLL's and adds them to the project. Does the web.config transforms. Does not even attempt to build the website but just packages into a zip file for me. What I can't figure out for the life of me is how to get MSBuild.exe to do that exact same thing! MSBuild.exe WebProject.vs2012.sln /m /T:Build 
    /p:Configuration=Release`;DeployOnBuild=true`;PublishProfile=TestDeploy
 The command above still tries to execute aspnet_compiler which is not what I want. The publish profile says that it shouldn't be precompiled... but in the logs I see it executing it. So: How can I use msbuild to deploy a Web Site Project without precompiling it?

If the child MOC (on the main thread) is performing a fetch with NSFetchedResultsController the parent context is sent an -executeFetchRequest: it can create a deadlock. Both operations are done within the context of a performBlock: for their respective MOCs although the docs seem to indicate that using a main thread concurrency type MOC on the main thread without performBlock: is fine. It appears that the private queue is waiting on the PSCs lock which the child context on the main thread has already locked. It appears that the child context (while holding the PSCs lock) is trying to dispatch_sync to the parent context and thus they are both waiting for each other. Is PriveQueue -> MainQueue a supported configuration? It seems most people still have the parent context on the main thread.

 He also writes this: I'm starting to think the problem is with NSFetchedResultsController which is always stuck at performFetch: when these deadlocks occur. Most of the time it will be stuck trying to fault in an object as a result of asking for it's section name. As a test I tried to reproduce what the FRC does and performed the executeFetchRequest: and then iterated through the results asking each object for it's section name. And this doesn't cause a deadlock. If I leave the FRC to do performFetch: after I do my test it will still deadlock there. I'm 99% sure that the FRC has a synchronization problem with nested contexts. Question: Does anybody know why this problem occurs? Do you know how to solve it? Is this a bug?

@TITLE:AngularJS : Custom filters and ng-repeat
@CONTENT:I'm an AngularJS newbie and I'm building up a small proof-of-concept car hire listings app that pulls in some JSON and renders out various bits of that data via an ng-repeat, with a couple of filters:    <article data-ng-repeat="result in results | filter:search" class="result">
        <header><h3>{{result.carType.name}}, {{result.carDetails.doors}} door, &pound;{{result.price.value}} - {{ result.company.name }}</h3></header>

                <li data-ng-show="result.carDetails.theftProtection">Theft Protection</li>
            </ul>

    <h4>Doors:</h4> 
    <select data-ng-model="search.carDetails">

        <option value="2">2</option>
        <option value="4">4</option>

@TITLE:Call Audio Stream Modification in Android 4.0 ICS
@CONTENT:I've been working on a project that would greatly benefit from call-stream modification. This has been repeatedly said/assumed to be unachievable, as most people believe that the hardware loop for the in-call audio is completely disconnected from the main MCU of the device. Questions like Stream audio to a phone call Android have received answers stating that it is impossible to access the audio. I agree that this is definitely impossible from the Android API, but it is completely unclear whether the hardware ACTUALLY is disconnected completely. The stackoverflow user 'artsylar' said that they were able to modify the 'framework layer' of Android OS to inject recorded audio into call streams, which would be a huge step forward (see Play an audio clip onto an ongoing call, artsylar's comment on the selected answer). Assuming artsylar's success is valid, there definitely is a way to control the call stream audio by modifying the framework (I assume the telephony base framework in the Android source). Basically, I completely agree that modifying or controlling the call-stream is impossible from the application layer. However, I am interested in customizing the Android OS in framework or Radio Interface Layer; artsylar seems to have had success, but there is no explanation in open-literature on how. Given the current state of Android technology, could anyone clarify the above to actually establish whether controlling call audio is possible by modifying the core Android OS, and a good path to accomplish this goal? I believe that a final clarification on this issue would be of great value to the open-source community. Thanks!

@TITLE:Line size of L1 and L2 caches
@CONTENT:From a previous question on this forum, I learned that in most of the memory systems, L1 cache is a subset of the L2 cache means any entry removed from L2 is also removed from L1. So now my question is how do I determine a corresponding entry in L1 cache for an entry in the L2 cache. The only information stored in the L2 entry is the tag information. Based on this tag information, if I re-create the addr it may span multiple lines in the L1 cache if the line-sizes of L1 and L2 cache are not same. Does the architecture really bother about flushing both the lines or it just maintains L1 and L2 cache with the same line-size. I understand that this is a policy decision but I want to know the commonly used technique.

Second, if it is installed, is it possible to display a flash video in an Activity? I'm thinking you'd have to use a WebView widget within your Activity to display the Flash content instead of something like a VideoView. Is Flash even supported within the WebView widget or is it only supported by the actual Browser app?

@TITLE:Can script.readyState be trusted to detect the end of dynamic script loading?
@CONTENT:I use dynamic script loading to reduce the duration of the initial page load. To ensure that the functions and objects defined by a script are accessible, I need to ensure that the script has been fully loaded. I have developed my own Javascript library to this end, and thus did quite a lot of research on the subject, studying how it's done in different libraries. During a discussion related to this issue, Kyle Simpson, the author of LABjs, stated that: LABjs (and many other loaders) set both "onload" and "onreadystatechange" on all script elements, knowing that some browsers will fire one, and some will fire the other... You can find an example of this in the current version of jQuery as of this writing, v1.3.2: // Attach handlers for all browsers
script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if ( !done && (!this.readyState ||
    this.readyState == "loaded" || this.readyState == "complete") ) {
        done = true;
        success();
        complete();

        // Handle memory leak in IE
        script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = null;
        head.removeChild( script );
    }
};
 That's the state of the art, but during the analysis of a strange behavior in Opera 9.64, I came to the conclusion that, using this technique, the onload callback got fired too early. I will post my own findings in answer to this question, and would like to gather further evidence and feedback from the community.

@TITLE:Java Web Service framework/library, which is a better one and why?
@CONTENT:Currently I am evaluating number of web service frameworks in Java. I need web service framework that will help me to expose some functionality of existent application running on JBoss, The application is mostly developed using Spring and POJOs (no EJBs). What I need is a framework having following properties: It should provide tools for automatic generation of boilerplate code and save time by eliminating repetitive tasks, for example tools generating WSDL from Java (java2wsdl), tools generating endpoints etc. Applications should be easily deployed on existent J2EE platform (JBoss), this means that it should contain as less as possible configuration files (like axis2.xml in axis2 framework). Also it is preferred to be able to deploy web service within .war archive of existent application. (it seems that Axis2 need a separate archive for web service app.) It will be very cool to use a combination of POJOs and Spring. Generally, the framework should have clean structure and design (for example Spring-WS lacks it), good documentation and whatever else characterizes a good piece of software. It is preferred that framework incorporates some standard features like JAX-WS etc. instead of vendor specific methods. I have briefly examined Axis2 Apache CXF and Sun's Metro Spring WS But still it is difficult to decide what to use in my case: Axis2 seems to be so low level, it requires separate application archive and lots of configurations Spring WS seems to be too opaque and "sophisticated for impression purposes (?)" Apache CXF and Metro probably are two frameworks that I prefer to chose from but still I need your opinion and experience about usage of some of them in a real-world applications.

@TITLE:Using Cookies across Activities when using HttpClient
@CONTENT:I'm trying a simple app to read in the HTML of a website, and tranform it to create an easily readable UI in Android (This is an exersize in learning android, not to make a useable app). The problem I'm having is persisting a users session across Activities and then using the session in a HttpClient once recalled. I would like to do this "Correctly", the recommended approach seem to be to use CookieManager. I've had problems with this however - I cannot seem to find the "Correct" way to take a Cookie from the CookieManager and use it in a later instantiation of HttpClient in a seperate Activities. When using a CookieManager I can save the Cookie and the Cookie is then in scope in other Activities (See code snippet 2). I haven't found how to use this later (See code snippet 3) when requesting a page. Enough talking, here is some code. First my login action and Cookie storage: private OnClickListener loginActionListener = new OnClickListener() 
{
    public void onClick(View v) 
    {
        EditText usernameTextView = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.Username);
        EditText passwordTextView = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.Password);
        String username = usernameTextView.getText().toString();
        String password = passwordTextView.getText().toString();

        try {
            HttpPost postMethod = new HttpPost(URI);                
            HttpParams params   = new BasicHttpParams();

            params.setParameter("mode", "login");
            params.setParameter("autologin", true);
            params.setParameter("username", username);
            params.setParameter("password", password);
            postMethod.setParams(params);

            DefaultHttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
            HttpResponse response        = httpClient.execute(postMethod);
            List<Cookie> cookies = httpClient.getCookieStore().getCookies();

            if(cookies != null)
            {
                for(Cookie cookie : cookies)
                {
                    String cookieString = cookie.getName() + "=" + cookie.getValue() + "; domain=" + cookie.getDomain();                        
                    CookieManager.getInstance().setCookie(cookie.getDomain(), cookieString);  
                }
            }
            CookieSyncManager.getInstance().sync();

            Intent intent = new Intent(v.getContext(), IndexAction.class);
            startActivity(intent);
    } catch (Exception e) {...}
}
 The startup Activity which decides wether to make the user login or go to the index is below. You can see from this code that the cookie is in scope and can be read: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    CookieSyncManager.createInstance(this);

    if(CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(URI) == null)
    {
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, LoginAction.class);
        startActivity(intent);
    }
    else
    {
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, IndexAction.class);
        startActivity(intent);
    }
}
 But from my code to read the Index page I'm hoping you can suggest what i'm missing: @Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    CookieSyncManager.createInstance(this);

    try
    {
            HttpGet getMethod = new HttpGet(URI_INDEX);  

            HttpParams params   = new BasicHttpParams();                        
            HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(params, 30000);
            HttpConnectionParams.setSoTimeout(params, 30000);

            // This code results in a ClassCastException, I'm assuming i've found a red herring with this solution.
            // HttpContext localContext = new BasicHttpContext();    
            // localContext.setAttribute(ClientContext.COOKIE_STORE, CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(URI));

            DefaultHttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient(params);
            HttpResponse response        = httpClient.execute(getMethod);

            if(response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() > 299 && response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() < 400)
            {
                // Not logged in doesn't give a redirect response. Very annoying.
            }

            final char[] buffer = new char[0x10000];
            StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();
            Reader in = new InputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent(), "UTF-8");
            int read = 0;
            while (read>=0)
            {
              read = in.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
              if (read>0) {
                out.append(buffer, 0, read);
              }
            }

            String returnString = out.toString();
    } catch (ClientProtocolException e) {...}
}

@TITLE:Android: How to store cookies?
@CONTENT:In my Android app, each activity is filled with data from an xml file which is somewhere on the web. The website providing these files has a login mechanism, that works with cookies. I know how to make a HTTP Request to the login page and receive a cookie. What I don't know is, how I can store it to re-use it in both other activities AND when the app is started the next time. The cookie is valid for a year, so the user of my app should log in once and then never again for a whole year. How do I do that? I googled a lot, but either I used the wrong keywords or there are no simple solutions on the internet. I hope somebody here can help me. Best regards and thanks in advance, Jan Oliver

@CONTENT:A client has asked us to develop a proprietary in-house app for managing their back-end systems. However, we are a small development company and I'm certain that their company does not have >500 employees. Are there any alternative, yet similar, solutions to distributing this app to their company without going through the iPhone enterprise program? (just to clarify: obviously, we would like to go through the official enterprise program but seeing how the company doesn't have >500 employees, this isn't possible). UPDATE (27/09): It appears Apple have removed the 500 employee limit for the enterprise distribution See here. So this will probably be our route now (which is helpful because the app is approaching completion). I'll update this as we go through the process if anyone would like me to, so that others may get an idea of what the actual process is like.

@CONTENT:Looking through the scheduler source code (2.6.34, kernel/sched.c), I can see how the "pluggable" schedulers are used, and I believe I understand the interface to be implemented. What I don't understand yet is how to get my code built into the kernel. At the very least, pointers to other sites would be appreciated. Right now, I'm grepping for SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, and SCHED_NORMAL in the kernel source tree, so really I'm looking for a more insightful way to look at it :-) EDIT: As some background, I'm very familiar with the FreeBSD scheduler (and the FreeBSD kernel in general), so I'm not looking for pointers on how to do process/thread level scheduling. I'm looking for a way to add my own scheduler alongside the normal linux schedulers (similar to SCHED_FIFO). EDIT #2: The BFS pointer below is a good start, but it still rips CFS out of the kernel. sched.c now looks like: #ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_BFS
#include "sched_bfs.c"
#else
   // original sched.c 
#endif // CONFIG_SCHED_BFS
 I'd love to see an answer or a pointer on how to do this a little better (ie, keep CFS, at least for right now). EDIT #3: I've answered my own question below, as I think I've figured it out.

@TITLE:Arrays vs Vectors: Introductory Similarities and Differences [closed]
@CONTENT:What are the differences between an array and a vector in C++? An example of the differences might be included libraries, symbolism, abilities, etc. Array Arrays contain a specific number of elements of a particular type. So that the compiler can reserve the required amount of space when the program is compiled, you must specify the type and number of elements that the array will contain when it is defined. The compiler must be able to determine this value when the program is compiled. Once an array has been defined, you use the identifier for the array along with an index to access specific elements within the array. [...] arrays are zero-indexed; that is, the first element is at index 0. This indexing scheme is indicative of the close relationship in C++ between pointers and arrays and the rules that the language defines for pointer arithmetic. ¡X C++ Pocket Reference Vector A vector is a dynamically sized sequence of objects that provides array-style operator[] random access. The member function push_back copies its arguments via copy constructor, adds that copy as the last item in the vector, and increments its size by one. pop_back does the exact opposite, by removing the last element. Inserting or deleting items from the end of a vector takes amortized constant time, and inserting or deleting from any other location takes linear time. These are the basics of vectors. There is a lot more to them. In most cases, a vector should be your first choice over a C-style array. First of all, they are dynamically sized, which means they can grow as needed. You don't have to do all sorts of research to figure out an optimal static size, as in the case of C arrays; a vector grows a needed, an it can be resized larger or smaller manually if you need to. second, vectors offer bounds checking with the at member function (but no with operator[]), so that you can do something if you reference a nonexistent index instead of simply watching your program crash or worse, continuing execution with corrupt data. ¡X C++ Cookbook

@LINK:/questions/1464642/git-merge-squash-repeatedly
@TITLE:Git merge squash repeatedly
@CONTENT:I'm trying to have two branches with binary files in git - one "development" and one "stable". The development branch can have several changes of these files before I want to "release" them to the stable branch (and the stable branch has those files renamed, in case that's relevant). I could do a normal merge, this works fine, but preserves too much history - when pulling the "stable" branch, all intermediate commits from the "development" branch are pulled as well (because they're parent commits). But we're talking about binary files that don't have any sensible merging strategy (except theirs/ours), so the actual history of the files on the development branch is useless. When I pull the "stable" branch, I get this: 
          X-------------------G stable
         /                   /
    a---b---c---d---e---f---g development
 Because G has a parent in the development branch, I get the whole history of the development branch (data objects for c, d, e, f and g) in my repository, which I'm not interested in (X is the same as b, with some file renaming applied). So I tried to git merge --squash changes from the development branch to the stable branch. The first such merge and commit went OK, the results were as expected (nice change log in the commit message, no relation to the development branch):           X-------------------G stable
         /                   
    a---b---c---d---e---f---g development After I pull this squashed stable branch, I get this in my repository, which is what I want: 
a---b---X---G
 But the second merge failed (because git had no way to know how much I merged already and got confused). Is it possible to somehow record the merge, without producing a "merge commit" with two parents? Or, is it possible to tell git to merge only a certain "range" of revisions, like in SVN? Or, is it possible to do a normal merge without having to download all refs from the other branch when pulling? Or should I provide a custom merge driver for the files in question, that simply renames "their" version to "our", thereby resolving the conflicts? I'm still afraid that --squash will always try to merge the whole history, up to the common parent, solving only half of my problem. Update: rebasing If I understand rebasing correctly, I'll end up with this: 
                              X stable
                             /
    a---b---c---d---e---f---g development
 Which gets me all the data I'm not interested in (c, d, e, f) and as a bonus, I'll loose the information that b was a stable version in the branch. Each development revision adds about 5MB to the repository size (and repacking the whole repo shrinks it only about 10%), the "stable" branch comes almost for free (the data is already there). I want pulling a single new revision from the stable branch to pull only the new 5MB, but instead updating from X to G downloads 25MB, because I'm somehow not able to say that I don't care about the contents of c, d, e and f.

@TITLE:Setter / property injection in Unity without attributes
@CONTENT:I am working on a project where the Unity framework is used as the IoC container. My question relates to injecting an optional dependency (in this case a logger) into several classes using property- or setter injection. I do not want to clutter the constructors of all my classes with these optional dependencies, but I cannot find a good way to handle this in Unity. The way you would do this is, according to the MSDN documentation, by adding an attribute to the property: private ILogger logger; 

[Dependency]
public ILogger Logger
{
get { return logger; }
  set { logger = value; }
}
 I find this very ugly. In StructureMap one could do the following to set all properties of a given type: SetAllProperties(policy => policy.OfType<ILog>());
 Does anyone know if it is possible to do something similar in Unity? Edit: Kim Major suggests using this approach which can also be achieved through code. I would be interested in examples of how to do this automatically for all matching properties.

@TITLE:How do I find out which JAXP implementation is in use and where it was loaded from?
@CONTENT:I would like to provide diagnostic information about what JAXP implementation is in use, and which JAR file it was loaded from. One way to achieve this is to create in instance of, for example, a DocumentBuilderFactory, and then inspect the properties of that class: private static String GetJaxpImplementation() {
    DocumentBuilderFactory documentBuilderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    Class<? extends DocumentBuilderFactory> c = documentBuilderFactory.getClass();
    Package p = c.getPackage();
    CodeSource source = c.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource();
    return MessageFormat.format(
            "Using JAXP implementation ''{0}'' ({1}) version {2} ({3}){4}",
            p.getName(),
            p.getImplementationVendor(),
            p.getSpecificationVersion(),
            p.getImplementationVersion(),
            source == null ? "." : " loaded from: " + source.getLocation());
}
 Is there a better way to achieve this, perhaps without having to create a DocumentBuilderFactory?
@CODE:DocumentBuilderFactory private static String GetJaxpImplementation() {
    DocumentBuilderFactory documentBuilderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
    Class<? extends DocumentBuilderFactory> c = documentBuilderFactory.getClass();
    Package p = c.getPackage();

            p.getName(),
            p.getImplementationVendor(),
            p.getSpecificationVersion(),
            p.getImplementationVersion(),

@LINK:/questions/1794412/adding-a-prefix-to-every-url-in-cakephp
@TITLE:Adding a prefix to every URL in CakePHP
@CONTENT:What's the cleanest way to add a prefix to every URL in CakePHP, like a language parameter? http://example.com/en/controller/action
http://example.com/ru/admin/controller/action
 It needs to work with "real" prefixes like admin, and ideally the bare URL /controller/action could be redirected to /DEFAULT-LANGUAGE/controller/action. It's working in a retro-fitted application for me now, but it was kind of a hack, and I need to include the language parameter by hand in most links, which is not good. So the question is twofold: What's the best way to structure Routes, so the language parameter is implicitly included by default without having to be specified for each newly defined Route? Router::connect('/:controller/:action/*', ...) should implicitly include the prefix. The parameter should be available in $this->params['lang'] or somewhere similar to be evaluated in AppController::beforeFilter(). How to get Router::url() to automatically include the prefix in the URL, if not explicitly specified? Router::url(array('controller' => 'foo', 'action' => 'bar')) should return /en/foo/bar Since Controller::redirect(), Form::create() or even Router::url() directly need to have the same behavior, overriding every single function is not really an option. Html::image() for instance should produce a prefix-less URL though. The following methods seem to call Router::url. Controller::redirect Controller::flash Dispatcher::__extractParams via Object::requestAction Helper::url JsHelper::load_ JsHelper::redirect_ View::uuid, but only for a hash generation Out of those it seems the Controller and Helper methods would need to be overridden, I could live without the JsHelper. My idea would be to write a general function in AppController or maybe just in bootstrap.php to handle the parameter insertion. The overridden Controller and Helper methods would use this function, as would I if I wanted to manually call Router::url. Would this be sufficient?
@CODE:http://example.com/en/controller/action
http://example.com/ru/admin/controller/action admin /controller/action /DEFAULT-LANGUAGE/controller/action Router::connect('/:controller/:action/*', ...) $this->params['lang'] AppController::beforeFilter() Router::url() Router::url(array('controller' => 'foo', 'action' => 'bar')) /en/foo/bar Controller::redirect() Form::create() Router::url() Html::image() Router::url Controller::redirect Controller::flash Dispatcher::__extractParams Object::requestAction Helper::url JsHelper::load_ JsHelper::redirect_ View::uuid JsHelper AppController bootstrap.php Router::url

@LINK:/questions/10950365/python-socket-io-client-for-sending-broadcast-messages-to-tornadio2-server
@TITLE:python Socket.IO client for sending broadcast messages to TornadIO2 server
@CONTENT:I am building a realtime web application. I want to be able to send broadcast messages from the server-side implementation of my python application. Here is the setup: socketio.js on the client-side TornadIO2 server as Socket.IO server python on the server-side (Django framework) I can succesfully send socket.io messages from the client to the server. The server handles these and can send a response. In the following i will describe how i did that. Current Setup and Code First, we need to define a Connection which handles socket.io events: class BaseConnection(tornadio2.SocketConnection):
    def on_message(self, message):
        pass

    # will be run if client uses socket.emit('connect', username)
    @event
    def connect(self, username):
        # send answer to client which will be handled by socket.on('log', function)
        self.emit('log', 'hello ' + username)
 Starting the server is done by a Django management custom method: class Command(BaseCommand):
    args = ''
    help = 'Starts the TornadIO2 server for handling socket.io connections'

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        autoreload.main(self.run, args, kwargs)

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        port = settings.SOCKETIO_PORT

        router = tornadio2.TornadioRouter(BaseConnection)

        application = tornado.web.Application(
            router.urls,
            socket_io_port = port
        )

        print 'Starting socket.io server on port %s' % port
        server = SocketServer(application)
 Very well, the server runs now. Let's add the client code: <script type="text/javascript">    
    var sio = io.connect('localhost:9000');

    sio.on('connect', function(data) {
        console.log('connected');
        sio.emit('connect', '{{ user.username }}');
    });

    sio.on('log', function(data) {
        console.log("log: " + data);
    });
</script>
 Obviously, {{ user.username }} will be replaced by the username of the currently logged in user, in this example the username is "alp". Now, every time the page gets refreshed, the console output is: connected
log: hello alp
 Therefore, invoking messages and sending responses works. But now comes the tricky part. Problems The response "hello alp" is sent only to the invoker of the socket.io message. I want to broadcast a message to all connected clients, so that they can be informed in realtime if a new user joins the party (for example in a chat application). So, here are my questions: How can i send a broadcast message to all connected clients? How can i send a broadcast message to multiple connected clients that are subscribed on a specific channel? How can i send a broadcast message anywhere in my python code (outside of the BaseConnection class)? Would this require some sort of Socket.IO client for python or is this builtin with TornadIO2? All these broadcasts should be done in a reliable way, so i guess websockets are the best choice. But i am open to all good solutions.
@CODE:class BaseConnection(tornadio2.SocketConnection):
    def on_message(self, message):
        pass

    # will be run if client uses socket.emit('connect', username)
    @event
    def connect(self, username):
        # send answer to client which will be handled by socket.on('log', function)
        self.emit('log', 'hello ' + username) class Command(BaseCommand):
    args = ''
    help = 'Starts the TornadIO2 server for handling socket.io connections'

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        autoreload.main(self.run, args, kwargs)

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        port = settings.SOCKETIO_PORT

        router = tornadio2.TornadioRouter(BaseConnection)

        application = tornado.web.Application(
            router.urls,
            socket_io_port = port
        )

        print 'Starting socket.io server on port %s' % port
        server = SocketServer(application) <script type="text/javascript">    
    var sio = io.connect('localhost:9000');

    sio.on('connect', function(data) {
        console.log('connected');
        sio.emit('connect', '{{ user.username }}');
    });

    sio.on('log', function(data) {
        console.log("log: " + data);
    });
</script> {{ user.username }} connected
log: hello alp BaseConnection

@TITLE:DDD: how the layers should be organized?
@CONTENT:I¡¦m very much new in software development. Personally I think layered architecture is a great way to reduce the complexities that arise in the process of software development in object oriented approach & , not to mention, to keep your code organized. Now, I¡¦ve run into some problems to be introduced with DDD (Domain Driven Design). Ofcourse, beginner level ones. Here it is ¡V Let's say, I want to build an application to save ¡§person¡¨ related data in database & display person details in a wpf datagrid (DDD is definitely not for the apps of such scale, but just to keep things simple for an amature like me). So, I designed a domain class "Person", something like ¡V public class Person
 {
    public Class1(dataType fieldAParam)
    {
        _fieldA = fieldAParam;
    }

    private dataType _fieldA;
    public dataType PropertyA
    {
        //encapsulates _fieldA    
    }

    private dataType _fieldB;
    public dataType PropertyB
    {        
        //encapsulates _fieldB    
    }

    private dataType _fieldC;
    public dataType PropertyC
    {        
        //encapsulates _fieldC    
    }

    public dataType PropertyX
    {        
        //some code based on private fields    
    }

    public dataType PropertyY
    {        
        //some code based on private fields    
    }

    private dataType MethodPQR(dataType param)
    {        
        //some code    
    }

    public dataType MethodUVW(dataType paramOne, dataType paramTwo)
    {        
        //some code    
    }
}
 Now, my understanding of DDD says the architecture (the simplest version of it) should be as follows (plz, correct me if i'm wrong) ¡V Note: I want the datagrid to be bound to some ObservableCollection, just to reflect any kind of changes instantly. It¡¦s a wpf application but not necessarily to be in MVVM pattern & I deliberately want to use the code behind (I have no idea if the code behind itself represent the Application Layer) So my questions are ¡V What kind of codes should belong to Application Layer? My guess is, I should definitely not bind an ObservableColletion of my domain object (Person) as the itmsSource of the datagrid. What type of object then I should extract from the domain object, & how? To keep a decoupling betwen Presentation Layer objects and Domain Layer object may be there¡¦s a convention like ¡§never instantiate domain objects directly in presentation layer¡¨. What are the non-¡§direct¡¨ approaches then? If the Code-Behind talks to the Application Layer then should the Application Layer talk to the Repository? But what if some kind of domain access is needed which is NOT data access related ( may be not in this app, but it may occur, right)? Who¡¦s that X guy in Domain Layer that the Application Layer should talk to? I know all my questions and problems are of very much amature level. But they are questions and problems indeed. So, if anybody has time, any response will be appreciated. EDIT : I think I missed another reference in the diagram. Data Repository should have a reference of Domain Model.

@TITLE:Can I encode a subclass of NSManagedObject?
@CONTENT:This is for an iPhone App, but I don't think that really matters. I need to send a custom object (which is managed by Core Data) over bluetooth using the iPhone's GameKit. Normally, I would just use an NSKeyedArchiver to package up the object as a data object and ship it over the line, then unarchive the object and I'm done. Of course, I would need to implement the initWithCoder: and encodeWithCoder: methods in my custom object as well. I'm not sure if this can be done with an NSManagedObject class, which is managed by Core Data or not. Will they play nice together? I'm guessing once I ship the encoded managed object over to the other device and unencode it, I would just add this received object to the other device's context. Is this correct? Am I missing any steps?

The process is long running and has many threads that need to make requests, but not all at the same time... specifically they do quite a lot of work before brief bursts of writing out a chunk of their results.

@CONTENT:Following up on my previous question concerning the Windows 7 taskbar, I would like to diagnose why Windows isn't acknowledging that my application is independent of javaw.exe. I presently have the following JNA code to obtain the AppUserModelID: public class AppIdTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NativeLibrary lib;
        try {
            lib = NativeLibrary.getInstance("shell32");
        } catch (Error e) {
            System.err.println("Could not load Shell32 library.");
            return;
        }
        Object[] functionArgs = new Object[1];
        String functionName = null;
        Function function;
        try {
            functionArgs[0] = new String("Vendor.MyJavaApplication")
                    .getBytes("UTF-16");
            functionName = "GetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID";
            function = lib.getFunction(functionName);
            // Output the current AppId
            System.out.println("1: " + function.getString(0));
            functionName = "SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID";
            function = lib.getFunction(functionName);
            // Set the new AppId
            int ret = function.invokeInt(functionArgs);
            if (ret != 0) {
                Logger.out.error(function.getName() + " returned error code "
                        + ret + ".");
            }
            functionName = "GetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID";
            function = lib.getFunction(functionName);
            // Output the current AppId
            System.out.println("2: " + function.getString(0));
            // Output the current AppID, converted from UTF-16
            System.out.println("3: "
                    + new String(function.getByteArray(0, 255), "UTF-16"));
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            System.err.println("System does not support UTF-16 encoding.");
        } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
            System.err.println(functionName + " was not found in "
                    + lib.getFile().getName() + ".");
        }
    }
}
 The output of the application is seemingly gibberish: 1: ??U????L???v3??E?SV?u?&
2: ??U????L???v3??E?SV?u?&
3: ????????????????P???????????
 Being aware of the fact that the output may be UTF-16, in (3) I attempted to convert a byte array from UTF-16. In all honesty I don't know if my approach here is right as (a) I don't know the size of a PWSTR and (b) I don't know if GetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID is indeed returning a byte array or string. I'm aware that JSmooth will run the GUI process in a wrapper which simulates this effect. Launch4j claims to do the same, but doesn't appear to work. I am looking to have the AppUserModelID set regardless of the Java wrapper. What is going wrong here?

            functionName = "GetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID";
            function = lib.getFunction(functionName);

@TITLE:What are the real-world pros and cons of each of the major mocking frameworks?
@CONTENT:see also "What should I consider when choosing a mocking framework for .Net" I'm trying to decide on a mocking framework to use on a .NET project I've recently embarked on. I'd like to speed my research on the different frameworks. I've recently read this blog post http://codevanced.net/post/Mocking-frameworks-comparison.aspx and wondered if any of the StackOverflow audience has anything to add in the way of real-world advantages and caveats to the frameworks. Could people could list the pros/cons of the mocking frameworks they either currently use or have investigated for their own use on .NET projects. I think this would be not only a help to me to decide for my current project, but it will help others make more informed decisions when picking the correct framework for their situation. I'm not an expert on any of the frameworks but I would like to get arguments for and against the major frameworks I've come across: RhinoMocks Moq TypeMock Isolator NMock Moles And other usable alternatives that I've missed. I'd also like insights from users that have switched or stopped using products because of issues.

@TITLE:Lat/Lon + Distance + Heading --> Lat/Lon
@CONTENT:So: I have the following function, adapted from a formula found online, which takes two lat/lon coordinates and finds the distance between them in miles (along a spherical Earth): public static double distance (double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {
    	double theta = toRadians(lon1-lon2);
    	lat1 = toRadians(lat1);
    	lon1 = toRadians(lon1);
    	lat2 = toRadians(lat2);
    	lon2 = toRadians(lon2);

    	double dist = sin(lat1)*sin(lat2) + cos(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(theta);
    	dist = toDegrees(acos(dist)) * 60 * 1.1515 * 1.609344 * 1000;

    	return dist;
    }
 As far as I can tell this works just fine. What I need is a second function which, using the exact same model of the Earth's geometry, takes a single lat/lon pair [A], a heading, and a distance, and outputs a new lat/lon pair [B] such that if you started at point [A], and traveled the given distance at the given heading, you'd wind up at point [B]. This is where the fact that my geometry skills have left me entirely comes into play :) Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks, -Dan
@CODE:public static double distance (double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {
    	double theta = toRadians(lon1-lon2);

I am trying to add something like the controls on the right and left of the basic movie controls. I had done this in the Open SDK by adding a subclass to the playerview, but now in the official SDK and Apple moving to MPMoviePlayerController I am not sure how to do it. Also with my old 1.x firmware way it required me to capture touch events and hide/show the control myself. I am hoping there is a way that would do this with the standard controls, but if not, that is fine. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:The Google Maps JavaScript version 3 API library documentation clearly explains: The Google Maps API supports the KML and GeoRSS data formats for displaying geographic information. These data formats are displayed on a map using a KmlLayer object, whose constructor takes the URL of a publicly accessible KML or GeoRSS file. There are even several Stack Overflow questions about how to load local data: Loading a local .kml file using google maps? Google Maps kml files Some of the answers have pointed to third party libraries which can parse KML locally without the file needing to be public: geoxml3 GeoXML EGeoXml And while these solutions are good if you have a need to keep your data private, I simply want to make development easier. When running locally I obviously cannot parse my KML and therefore lose functionality that I am trying to test. I've posted a single generic KML file on a publicly available site, but then have to have different development code to render one thing vs. something else when running for real. What are my options for local development to render what would be publicly available dynamically generated KML files?

Android recommends it, so I want to use it, but I get different values. azimuth: [-180, 180]. -180/180 is S, 0 i N, 90 E and -90 W. pitch: [-90, 90]. 90 is 90, -90 is -90, 0 is 0 but -180/180 (lying with the screen downwards) is 0. roll: [-180, 180].

@TITLE:What are the [dis]advantages of using a key/value table over nullable columns or separate tables?
@CONTENT:I'm upgrading a payment management system I created a while ago. It currently has one table for each payment type it can accept. It is limited to only being able to pay for one thing, which this upgrade is to alleviate. I've been asking for suggestions as to how I should design it, and I have these basic ideas to work from: Have one table for each payment type, with a few common columns on each. (current design) Coordinate all payments with a central table that takes on the common columns (unifying payment IDs regardless of type), and identifies another table and row ID that has columns specialized to that payment type. Have one table for all payment types, and null the columns which are not used for any given type. Use the central table idea, but store specialized columns in a key/value table. My goals for this are: not ridiculously slow, self-documenting as much as possible, and maximizing flexibility while maintaining the other goals. I don't like 1 very much because of the duplicate columns in each table. It reflects the payment type classes inheriting a base class that provides functionality for all payment types... ORM in reverse? I'm leaning toward 2 the most, because it's just as "type safe" and self-documenting as the current design. But, as with 1, to add a new payment type, I need to add a new table. I don't like 3 because of its "wasted space", and it's not immediately clear which columns are used for which payment types. Documentation can alleviate the pain of this somewhat, but my company's internal tools do not have an effective method for storing/finding technical documentation. The argument I was given for 4 was that it would alleviate needing to change the database when adding a new payment method, but it suffers even worse than 3 does from the lack of explicitness. Currently, changing the database isn't a problem, but it could become a logistical nightmare if we decide to start letting customers keep their own database down the road. So, of course I have my biases. Does anyone have any better ideas? Which design do you think fits best? What criteria should I base my decision on?

@TITLE:Where to start (self-)learning C, or should I learn a different language? [closed]
@CONTENT:Lately, I discover more and more that it's good to have extensive knowledge of programming fundamentals. Sadly, I am (one of the many) self-taught PHP developers and have no regrets choosing that path. However, I still think I should extend my knowledge to some "real" programming languages starting from zero and build up my knowledge from there. I have no intention of changing my career path, but I do think it would be good to think out of the web-development box. I prefer not taking classes or courses, because I simply do not have the time for this. So: What is the best way to teach myself C step by step, starting from level zero? As my main goal is to learn more programming fundamentals, is C even a good choice for this? If not, what language would be? Summary so far: First of all, thanks for all the great responses. These will be quite helpful. Although most people seem to agree that starting off with C is not a bad choice, I have also seen people state that it is probably a better idea to skip C and go with C++ or even C#, since these languages are more current. My personal opinion is still that it would be good to start from level zero, even if the language itself is not directly contributive to the things I make. I still believe it will indirectly make me a better programmer. But then again, like said, my knowledge of these languages is quite limited, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter aswell.

@LINK:/questions/14341156/calculating-page-load-time-in-javascript
@TITLE:Calculating Page Load Time In JavaScript
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a webpage that, when it starts loading, uses an Interval to start a timer. When the page fully loads, it stops the timer, but 99% of the time i get time measurements of 0.00 or 0.01 even if it takes longer. Occasionally, it says something that makes more sense like .28 or 3.10 at some times. Here is the code if it helps: var hundredthstimer = 0;
var secondplace = 0;

function addinc(){

    hundredthstimer += 1;
    if (inctimer == 100){
        hundredthstimer = 0;
        secondplace += 1;
    }

}

var clockint = setInterval(addinc, 10);

function init(){
    var bconv1 = document.getElementById("bconverter1");
    var bconv2 = document.getElementById("bconverter2");

    $(bconv2).hide();

    clearInterval(clockint);

    if (inctimer.len !== 2){
        inctimer = "0" + inctimer;
    }
    alert(secondplace + "." + inctimer);
}
onload = init;
 So it basically creates a variable called hundredthstimer which is increased by '1' every 10 miliseconds(.01 seconds). Then, if this number reaches 1000(1 full second), a variable called secondsplace goes up by 1, since that is how many full seconds it has run for. Then, it alerts secondsplace, a decimal point, and hundredthsplace as the total load time. But the problem above with incorrect numbers still exists. Why?
@CODE:var hundredthstimer = 0;
var secondplace = 0;

function addinc(){

    hundredthstimer += 1;
    if (inctimer == 100){
        hundredthstimer = 0;
        secondplace += 1;
    }

}

var clockint = setInterval(addinc, 10);

function init(){
    var bconv1 = document.getElementById("bconverter1");
    var bconv2 = document.getElementById("bconverter2");

    $(bconv2).hide();

    clearInterval(clockint);

    if (inctimer.len !== 2){
        inctimer = "0" + inctimer;
    }
    alert(secondplace + "." + inctimer);
}

@TITLE:Minifying final HTML output using regular expressions with CodeIgniter
@CONTENT:Google pages suggest you to minify HTML, that is, remove all the unnecessary spaces. CodeIgniter does have the feature of giziping output or it can be done via .htaccess. But still I also would like to remove unnecessary spaces from the final HTML output as well. I played a bit with this piece of code to do it, and it seems to work. This does indeed result in HTML that is without excess spaces and removes other tab formatting. class Welcome extends CI_Controller 
{
    function _output()
    {
        echo preg_replace('!\s+!', ' ', $output);
    }

    function index(){
    ...
    }
}
 The problem is there may be tags like <pre>,<textarea>, etc.. which may have spaces in them and a regular expression should remove them. So, how do I remove excess space from the final HTML, without effecting spaces or formatting for these certain tags using a regular expression? Thanks to @Alan Moore got the answer, this worked for me echo preg_replace('#(?ix)(?>[^\S ]\s*|\s{2,})(?=(?:(?:[^<]++|<(?!/?(?:textarea|pre)\b))*+)(?:<(?>textarea|pre)\b|\z))#', ' ', $output);
 ridgerunner did a very good job of analyzing this regular expression. I ended up using his solution. Cheers to ridgerunner.

@CONTENT:I recently started following this guide to migrate my project to .NET 4.5.1 and Web Api 2. The very first thing MS developer Rick Anderson asks you to do is change: WebApiConfig.Register(GlobalConfiguration.Configuration);
 to GlobalConfiguration.Configure(WebApiConfig.Register);
 in the global.asax file. Yet this is giving me an error when I try to build: Error 1 'System.Web.Http.GlobalConfiguration' does not contain a definition for 'Configure' My project is currently on MVC 5 and Web Api 2 and .NET 4.5.1, yet I think System.Web.Http still thinks it's the .NEt 4.0 version. How can I go about fixing this? Thank you. Edit: Here are my assembly bindings: <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">

 Everything commented out after the top was commented because I was getting the error: Warning 2 Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly that could not be resolved.

@TITLE:Access ¡§this¡¨ from Java anonymous class
@CONTENT:Given the following code: public interface Selectable {
  public void select();
}

public class Container implements Selectable {

    Selectable s = new Selectable() {

}
 I want to access Container.select() from within my anonymous class' select() method. However, this.select() would again call the anonymous class' select() method. My suggestion would be: Introduce a field into Container, e.g. private Container self = this;
 Now I can access Container.select() by calling self.select() from within the anonymous class. Is this a reasonable way? Or are there any better ways?
@CODE:public interface Selectable {
  public void select();

@CONTENT:The app works fine in the simulator, builds and runs. When I attach my device (iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.3) and target the iPhone, the result is "Build failed" with "No issues". Looking at the build results window, everything is green, has a checkmark, including the Build failed notice. Expanding the transcripts show no errors. I cannot exclude the possibility of a signing or provisioning error, but it gave me those errors, I ironed them out, and now it's not giving me any errors or issues, just "Build failed; No issues" In what ways can the build fail with no issues? Is there a way I can watch the build output to see if I can find the reason it's failing with no issues? Is there build output produced beyond the issues list? I don't see on the build window where it attempts to load the app onto my device - is this output elsewhere?

@TITLE:Concatenate two string literals
@CONTENT:I am very new to programming, and am reading Accelerated C++ by Koenig. Anyways, I am learning about strings and he writes that "the new idea is that we can use + to concatenate a string and a string literal - or, for that matter, two strings (but not two string literals). Fine, this makes sense I suppose. Now onto two separate exercises meant to illuminate this . Are the following definitions valid? const string hello = "Hello";

const string message = hello + ",world" + "!";
 Now, I tried to execute the above and it worked! So I was happy. Then I tried to do the next exercise; const string exclam = "!";

const string message = "Hello" + ",world" + exclam;
 This did not work. Now I understand it has something to do with the fact that you cannot concatenate two string literals, but I don't understand the semantic difference between why I managed to get the first example to work (isn't ",world" and "!" two string literals? SHouldn't this not have worked?) but not the second. Thank you!
@CODE:const string hello = "Hello";

const string message = hello + ",world" + "!"; const string exclam = "!";

const string message = "Hello" + ",world" + exclam; const string message = "Hello" ",world" + exclam + "Hello" + ", world!" "Hello, world!" "hello" " world" == "hello world"

 If I use 'text' rather than 'blob' and don't compress the HTML snippet, it works all fine (db is to large though). When I use 'blob' and compress via Python zlib library, I get the above error message. I looked around but couldn't find a simple answer for this one.

@LINK:/questions/26307071/does-the-c-volatile-keyword-introduce-a-memory-fence
@TITLE:Does the C++ volatile keyword introduce a memory fence?
@CONTENT:I understand that volatile informs the compiler that the value may be changed, but in order to accomplish this functionality, does the compiler need to introduce a memory fence to make it work? From my understanding, the sequence of operations on volatile objects cannot be reordered and must be preserved. This seems to imply some memory fences are necessary and that there isn't really a way around this. Am I correct in saying this? There is an interesting discussion at this related question Jonathan Wakely writes: ... Accesses to distinct volatile variables cannot be reordered by the compiler as long as they occur in separate full expressions ... right that volatile is useless for thread-safety, but not for the reasons he gives. It's not because the compiler might reorder accesses to volatile objects, but because the CPU might reorder them. Atomic operations and memory barriers prevent the compiler and the CPU from reordering To which David Schwartz replies in the comments: ... There's no difference, from the point of view of the C++ standard, between the compiler doing something and the compiler emitting instructions that cause the hardware to do something. If the CPU may reorder accesses to volatiles, then the standard doesn't require that their order be preserved. ... ... The C++ standard doesn't make any distinction about what does the reordering. And you can't argue that the CPU can reorder them with no observable effect so that's okay -- the C++ standard defines their order as observable. A compiler is compliant with the C++ standard on a platform if it generates code that makes the platform do what the standard requires. If the standard requires accesses to volatiles not be reordered, then a platform the reorders them isn't compliant. ... My point is that if the C++ standard prohibits the compiler from reordering accesses to distinct volatiles, on the theory that the order of such accesses is part of the program's observable behavior, then it also requires the compiler to emit code that prohibits the CPU from doing so. The standard does not differentiate between what the compiler does and what the compiler's generate code makes the CPU do. Which does yield two questions: Is either of them "right"? What do actual implementations really do?

@CONTENT:Context: We have some users reporting issues with a file upload feature in our web application. It only happens occasionally and without any special pattern. We have been trying to figure it out for a long time, adding debug information anywhere we can think it might help, crawling the logs etc, but we have not been able to reproduce or figure it out. Problem: I'm now trying to reproduce this by using MSTest and WatiN to repeat the operation that is supposed to fail a large number of times (several hundreds). Just to have a clue about how far in the loop the test has gotten, I want to print something like: Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Uploaded file, attempt {0} of {1}", i, maxUploads));
 This does however not appear in the Output window. Now I know that you'll get the console output in the test results (as well as what you output from Debug.Writeline etc), but this is not available until after the test has finished. And since my test with hundreds of repetitions could take quite some time, I'd like to know how far it has gotten. Question: Is there a way I can get the console output in the Output window during test execution?

@TITLE:MongoDB select count(distinct x) on an indexed column - count unique results for large data sets
@CONTENT:I have gone through several articles and examples, and have yet to find an efficient way to do this SQL query in MongoDB (where there are millions of rows documents) First attempt (e.g. from this almost duplicate question - Mongo equivalent of SQL's SELECT DISTINCT?) db.myCollection.distinct("myIndexedNonUniqueField").length
 Obviously I got this error as my dataset is huge Thu Aug 02 12:55:24 uncaught exception: distinct failed: {
        "errmsg" : "exception: distinct too big, 16mb cap",
        "code" : 10044,
        "ok" : 0
}
 Second attempt I decided to try and do a group db.myCollection.group({key: {myIndexedNonUniqueField: 1},
                initial: {count: 0}, 
                 reduce: function (obj, prev) { prev.count++;} } );
 But I got this error message instead: exception: group() can't handle more than 20000 unique keys
 Third attempt I haven't tried yet but there are several suggestions that involve mapReduce e.g. this one how to do distinct and group in mongodb? (not accepted, answer author / OP didn't test it) this one MongoDB group by Functionalities (seems similar to Second Attempt) this one http://blog.emmettshear.com/post/2010/02/12/Counting-Uniques-With-MongoDB this one https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/mongodb-user/trDn3jJjqtE this one http://cookbook.mongodb.org/patterns/unique_items_map_reduce/ Also It seems there is a pull request on GitHub fixing the .distinct method to mention it should only return a count, but it's still open: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/pull/34 But at this point I thought it's worth to ask here, what is the latest on the subject? Should I move to SQL or another NoSQL DB for distinct counts? or is there an efficient way? Update: This comment on the MongoDB official docs is not encouraging, is this accurate? http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Aggregation#comment-430445808 Update2: Seems the new Aggregation Framework answers the above comment... (MongoDB 2.1/2.2 and above, development preview available, not for production) http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/aggregation/

Is there any situation where one is more preferable to the other? Sample code (test.txt is read only). First way: DirectoryInfo dir = new DirectoryInfo(@"C:\Users\David\Desktop\");
dir.CreateSubdirectory("Test");

DirectoryInfo test = new DirectoryInfo(@"C:\Users\David\Desktop\Test\");

dir.CreateSubdirectory("Test");

DirectoryInfo test = new DirectoryInfo(@"C:\Users\David\Desktop\Test\");

The whole thing can be easily stripped down to a minimal example: template<typename T, typename U, int N> struct X {
    void f(T* t)
    {
        // expected-error{{use 'template' keyword to treat 'f0' as a dependent template name}}

            ^

@TITLE:Spring 3.0 vs Java EE 6.0 [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm confronted with a situation... I've been asked to give an advise regarding which approach to take, in terms of Java EE development between Spring 3.0 and Java EE 6.0. I was, and still am, a promoter of Spring 2.5 over classic Java EE 5 development, specially with JBoss, I even migrated old apps to Spring and influenced the re-definition of the development policy here to include Spring specific APIs, and helped the development of a strategic plan to foster more lightweight solutions like Spring + Tomcat, instead of the heavier ones of JBoss, right now, we're using JBoss merely as a Web container, having what I call the "container inside the container paradox", that is, having Spring apps, with most of its APIs, running inside JBoss, So we're in the process of migrating to tomcat. However, with the coming of Java EE 6.0 many features, that made Spring attractive at that time, easy deployment, less-coupling, even some sort of D.I, etc, seems to have been mimicked, in one way or the other. JSF 2.0, JPA 2.0, WebBeans, WebProfiles, etc. So, the question goes... From your point of view, how save, and logical, it is to continue to invest in a non-standard Java EE development framework like Spring given the new perspectives offered by Java EE 6.0? Can we talk about maybe 3 or 4 more years of Spring development, or do you recommend early adoption of Java EE 6.0 APIs and its practices? I'll appreciate any insights with this.

As I'm familiar with posix regular expressions I would like to know if there are any common samples where lua pattern matching is "better" compared to regular expression -- or did I misinterpret the sentence? and if there are any common examples: why is any of pattern-matching vs. regular expressions better suited?

@LINK:/questions/231525/raising-c-sharp-events-with-an-extension-method-is-it-bad
@TITLE:Raising C# events with an extension method - is it bad?
@CONTENT:We're all familiar with the horror that is C# event declaration. To ensure thread-safety, the standard is to write something like this: public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;
protected virtual void OnSomethingHappened(EventArgs e)
{            
    var handler = SomethingHappened;
    if (handler != null)
        handler(this, e);
}
 Recently in some other question on this board (which I can't find now), someone pointed out that extension methods could be used nicely in this scenario. Here's one way to do it: static public class EventExtensions
{
    static public void RaiseEvent(this EventHandler @event, object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var handler = @event;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(sender, e);
    }
    static public void RaiseEvent<T>(this EventHandler<T> @event, object sender, T e)
        where T : EventArgs
    {
        var handler = @event;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(sender, e);
    }
}
 With these extension methods in place, all you need to declare and raise an event is something like this: public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;

void SomeMethod()
{
    this.SomethingHappened.RaiseEvent(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}
 My question: Is this a good idea? Are we missing anything by not having the standard On method? (One thing I notice is that it doesn't work with events that have explicit add/remove code.)
@CODE:public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;
protected virtual void OnSomethingHappened(EventArgs e)
{            
    var handler = SomethingHappened;
    if (handler != null)
        handler(this, e);
} static public class EventExtensions
{
    static public void RaiseEvent(this EventHandler @event, object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var handler = @event;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(sender, e);
    }
    static public void RaiseEvent<T>(this EventHandler<T> @event, object sender, T e)
        where T : EventArgs
    {
        var handler = @event;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(sender, e);
    }
} public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;

{
    this.SomethingHappened.RaiseEvent(this, EventArgs.Empty);

@LINK:/questions/20312765/navigation-controller-top-layout-guide-not-honored-with-custom-transition
@TITLE:Navigation controller top layout guide not honored with custom transition
@CONTENT:Short version: I am having a problem with auto layout top layout guide when used in conjunction with custom transition and UINavigationController in iOS7. Specifically, the constraint between the top layout guide and the text view is not being honored. Has anyone encountered this issue? Long version: I have a scene which has unambiguously define constraints (i.e. top, bottom, left and right) that renders a view like so: But when I use this with a custom transition on the navigation controller, the top constraint to the top layout guide seems off and it renders is as follows, as if the top layout guide was at the top of the screen, rather than at the bottom of the navigation controller: It would appear that the "top layout guide" with the navigation controller is getting confused when employing the custom transition. The rest of the constraints are being applied correctly. And if I rotate the device and rotate it again, everything is suddenly rendered correctly, so it does not appear to be not a matter that the constraints are not defined properly. Likewise, when I turn off my custom transition, the views render correctly. Having said that, _autolayoutTrace is reporting that the UILayoutGuide objects suffer from AMBIGUOUS LAYOUT, when I run: (lldb) po [[UIWindow keyWindow] _autolayoutTrace]
 But those layout guides are always reported as ambiguous whenever I look at them even though I've ensured that there are no missing constraints (I've done the customary selecting of view controller and choosing "Add missing constraints for view controller" or selecting all of the controls and doing the same for them). In terms of how precisely I'm doing the transition, I've specified an object that conforms to UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning in the animationControllerForOperation method: - (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)navigationController:(UINavigationController *)navigationController
                                  animationControllerForOperation:(UINavigationControllerOperation)operation
                                               fromViewController:(UIViewController*)fromVC
                                                 toViewController:(UIViewController*)toVC
{
    if (operation == UINavigationControllerOperationPush)
        return [[PushAnimator alloc] init];

    return nil;
}
 And @implementation PushAnimator

- (NSTimeInterval)transitionDuration:(id <UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    return 0.5;
}

- (void)animateTransition:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    UIViewController* toViewController   = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey];
    UIViewController* fromViewController = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey];

    [[transitionContext containerView] addSubview:toViewController.view];
    CGFloat width = fromViewController.view.frame.size.width;

    toViewController.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(width, 0);

    [UIView animateWithDuration:[self transitionDuration:transitionContext] animations:^{
        fromViewController.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(-width / 2.0, 0);
        toViewController.view.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity;
    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
        fromViewController.view.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity;
        [transitionContext completeTransition:![transitionContext transitionWasCancelled]];
    }];
}

@end
 I've also done a rendition of the above, setting the frame of the view rather than the transform, with the same result. I've also tried manually make sure that the constraints are re-applied by calling layoutIfNeeded. I've also tried setNeedsUpdateConstraints, setNeedsLayout, etc. Bottom line, has anyone successfully married custom transition of navigation controller with constraints that use top layout guide?
@CODE:UINavigationController _autolayoutTrace UILayoutGuide AMBIGUOUS LAYOUT (lldb) po [[UIWindow keyWindow] _autolayoutTrace] UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning animationControllerForOperation - (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)navigationController:(UINavigationController *)navigationController

@TITLE:Why was pair range access removed from C++11?
@CONTENT:I just discovered that at one point, the C++11 draft had std::begin/std::end overloads for std::pair that allowed treating a pair of iterators as a range suitable for use in a range-based for loop (N3126, section 20.3.5.5), but this has since been removed. Does anyone know why it was removed? I find the removal very unfortunate, because it seems there is no other way to treat a pair of iterators as a range. Indeed: The lookup rules for begin/end in a range-based for loop say that begin/end are looked for in 1) as member functions of the range object 2) as free functions in "associated namespaces" std::pair does not have begin/end member functions The only associated namespace for std::pair<T, U> in general is namespace std We are not allowed to overload std::begin/std::end for std::pair ourselves We cannot specialize std::begin/std::end for std::pair (because the specialization would have to be partial and that's not allowed for functions) Is there some other way that I am missing?

However, when tried under ruby 1.9.1, it doesn't seem to work. Here's a simple test script I wrote, along with the output I'm getting: $ cat test.rb

ps sd.upcase, su.downcase, "Plain ruby"

@CONTENT:Where can I find Documentation on running Javascript inside a PDF? I've never added a javascript action inside a pdf. However, I've done quite a bit of web development using javascript. I have a few questions to whoever has any familiarity with javascript inside a PDF. NitroPDF and Adobe Acrobat definitely support javascript in PDFs. Is there a standard on various objects that exist and functions to maniuplate a pdf via javascript? Everything I've found so far has been from Adobe. Anywhere else seems to reference Adobe's docs. Is there a standard out there, or is Adobe just the "de Facto" standard. Also, Do all PDF Viewers support javascript actions? The best docs on using javascript inside a pdf document that I could find was from Adobe - Adobe :: Acrobat Javascript Scripting Guide NitroPDF has this link - NitroPDF :: Javascript in PDF Files, but it basically just says it supports what Adobe has. I also found this link from Scribus - Scribus :: How to enhance your PDF forms with JavaScript, but this only includes a few small snippets of code. Nothing super useful. Adobe has docs on how you can set breakpoints etc... for javascript using their IDE. Is it possible to run javascript in a pdf using another IDE and have breakpoints etc...? Would be awesome to find something as cool as Firebug. Note: Please do not answer how to manipulate a PDF that is loaded in a web browser. The question is about running javascript from within a PDF document. I'm trying to explore the possibilities available via executing javascript in the PDF document. Specifically I may use functions from quickpdflibrary to add javascript functionality to existing documents. Edit Another useful link is Developing with Acrobat Javascript. Apparently js in PDFs is frequently called AcroJS or Acrobat JavaScript.

@TITLE:How to send 500 Internal Server Error error from a PHP script
@CONTENT:I need to send "500 Internal Server Error" from an PHP script under certain conditions. The script is supposed to be called by a third party app. The script contains a couple of die("this happend") statements for which I need to send the 500 Internal Server Error response code instead of the usual 200 OK. The third party script will re-send the request under certain conditions which include not receiving the 200 OK response code. Second part of the question: I need to setup my script like this: <?php
    custom_header( "500 Internal Server Error" );

    if ( that_happened ) {
        die( "that happened" )
    }

    if ( something_else_happened ) {
        die( "something else happened" )
    }

    update_database( );

    // the script can also fail on the above line
    // e.g. a mysql error occurred

    remove_header( "500" );
?>
 I need to send 200 header only after the last line has been executed. Edit A side question: can I send strange 500 headers such as these: HTTP/1.1 500 No Record Found
HTTP/1.1 500 Script Generated Error (E_RECORD_NOT_FOUND)
HTTP/1.1 500 Conditions Failed on Line 23
 Will such errors get logged by the webserver?

@CONTENT:Hi all is there simple way using json in .Net to ensure that the keys are sent as lower case. At the moment I'm using the newtonsoft.json library and simply using string loginRequest = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(auth); In this case auth is just the following object public class Authority
{
    public string Username { get; set; }

}
 This results in {"Username":"Mark","ApiToken":"xyzABC1234"}
 Is there away to ensure that the username and apitoken keys come through as lowercase ? I don't want to simply run it through string.tolower() of course because the values for username & apitoken are mixed case. I realise I can programically do this and create the json string manually, but i need this for approx 20 or so json data strings and seeing if i can save myself some time. Wondering if there are any already build libraries that allow you to enforce lowercase for key creation.

I don't understand what Django is loading into memory or why it is doing this.

  <Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" />

 This works but with one issue. The difference between this output, and the output generated when using the Publish menu item in Visual Studio, is that the Web.Release.config transformation is not applied to the Web.config file when using the MSBuild method. Instead, Web.config, Web.Release.config, and Web.Debug.config are all copied. Any ideas are appreciated.

@CONTENT:Over the course of the last couple of hours I have been tracking down a fairly specific bug with that occurs because another application has the clipboard open. Essentially as the Clipboard is a shared resource (as per "Why does my shared clipboard not work?") and you attempt to execute Clipboard.SetText(string)

 The following exception is thrown: 
System.Runtime.InteropServices.ExternalException: Requested Clipboard operation did not succeed.

    at System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText(String text, TextDataFormat format)
    at System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText(String text)
 My initial solution was to retry after a short pause, until I realised that Clipboard.SetDataObject has fields for the number of times and the length of the delay, .NETs default behaviour is to try 10 times with 100msec delay. There is one final thing that has been noted by the end user, that is despite the exception being thrown the copy to clipboard operation still works, I haven't been able to find any further information about why this may be. My current solution to the issue is just to silently ignore the exception... is this really the best way?

@TITLE:Faster weighted sampling without replacement
@CONTENT:This question led to a new R package: wrswoR R's default sampling without replacement using sample.int seems to require quadratic run time, e.g. when using weights drawn from a uniform distribution. This is slow for large sample sizes. Does anybody know a faster implementation that would be usable from within R? Two options are "rejection sampling with replacement" (see this question on stats.sx) and the algorithm by Wong and Easton (1980) (with a Python implementation in a StackOverflow answer). Thanks to Ben Bolker for hinting at the C function that is called internally when sample.int is called with replace=F and non-uniform weights: ProbSampleNoReplace. Indeed, the code shows two nested for loops (line 420 ff of random.c). Here's the code to analyze the run time empirically: library(plyr)

sample.int.test <- function(n, p) {
    sample.int(2 * n, n, replace=F, prob=p); NULL }

times <- ldply(
  1:7,
  function(i) {
    n <- 1024 * (2 ** i)
    p <- runif(2 * n)
    data.frame(
      n=n,
      user=system.time(sample.int.test(n, p), gcFirst=T)['user.self'])
  },
  .progress='text'
)

times

@TITLE:Automapper : mapping issue with inheritance and abstract base class on collections with Entity Framework 4 Proxy Pocos
@CONTENT:I am having an issue using AutoMapper (which is an excellent technology) to map a business object to a DTO where I have inheritance off of an abstract base class within a collection. Here are my objects: abstract class Payment
class CashPayment : Payment
class CreditCardPayment : Payment
 I also have an invoice object which contains a collection of payments like so:     public class Invoice
    {
       ... properties...

       public ICollection<Payment> Payments { get; set; }
    }
 I also have corresponding DTO versions of each of these objects. The DtoInvoice object is defined as: [DataContract]
public class DtoInvoice
{
   ...properties...

   [DataMember]
   public List<DtoPayment> Payments { get; set; }
}
 This is what my Mapper definitions look like: Mapper.CreateMap<Invoice, DtoInvoice>();

Mapper.CreateMap<Payment, DtoPayment>()
  .Include<CashPayment, DtoCashPayment>()
  .Include<CreditCardPayment, DtoCreditCardPayment>();

Mapper.CreateMap<CashPayment, DtoCashPayment>();
Mapper.CreateMap<CreditCardPayment, DtoCreditCardPayment>();
 The code to perform the mapping looks like this: var invoice = repo.GetInvoice(invoiceId);

var dtoInvoice = Mapper.Map<Invoice, DtoInvoice>(invoice);
 So for example if my invoice object contains a collection of specific payments (say 1 cash and 1 credit card) when mapper tries to map them I get an error that the abstract class Payment cannot be created. If I remove the abstract keyword from the Payment object then the code works but I only get a collection of Payment object, I do not get their specific objects (Cash & Credit Card payments). So the question is: How can I get AutoMapper to map the specific payment types and not the base class? Update I did some more digging and think I see a problem but am not sure how I can solve this with AutoMapper. I think this is more of an EF thing and not AutoMapper's fault. :-) In my code I am using Entity Framework 4 Proxy POCOs with lazy loading. So when I try to map an entity returned from EF that is a proxy POCO it gets that funny looking type like: System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.CashPayment_86783D165755C316A2F58A4343EEC4842907C5539AF24F0E64AEF498B15105C2
 So my theory is that when AutoMapper tries to map CashPayment to DtoCashPayment and the payment passed in is of the proxy type AutoMapper sees it as a "non match" and then maps the generic Payment type. But since Payment is an abstract class AutoMapper bombs with a "System.InvalidOperationException: Instances of abstract classes cannot be created." exception. So the question is: Is there a way for me to use AutoMapper to map EF POCO proxy objects to Dtos.
@CODE:abstract class Payment
class CashPayment : Payment
class CreditCardPayment : Payment public class Invoice
    {
       ... properties...

       public ICollection<Payment> Payments { get; set; }
    } [DataContract]
public class DtoInvoice
{
   ...properties...

   [DataMember]
   public List<DtoPayment> Payments { get; set; }
} Mapper.CreateMap<Invoice, DtoInvoice>();

Mapper.CreateMap<Payment, DtoPayment>()
  .Include<CashPayment, DtoCashPayment>()
  .Include<CreditCardPayment, DtoCreditCardPayment>();

Mapper.CreateMap<CashPayment, DtoCashPayment>();
Mapper.CreateMap<CreditCardPayment, DtoCreditCardPayment>(); var invoice = repo.GetInvoice(invoiceId);

var dtoInvoice = Mapper.Map<Invoice, DtoInvoice>(invoice); System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.CashPayment_86783D165755C316A2F58A4343EEC4842907C5539AF24F0E64AEF498B15105C2

@LINK:/questions/2281566/is-josh-smiths-implementation-of-the-relaycommand-flawed
@TITLE:Is Josh Smith's implementation of the RelayCommand flawed?
@CONTENT:Consider the reference Josh Smith' article WPF Apps With The Model-View-ViewModel Design Pattern, specifically the example implementation of a RelayCommand (In Figure 3). (No need to read through the entire article for this question.) In general, I think the implementation is excellent, but I have a question about the delegation of CanExecuteChanged subscriptions to the CommandManager's RequerySuggested event. The documentation for RequerySuggested states: Since this event is static, it will only hold onto the handler as a weak reference. Objects that listen for this event should keep a strong reference to their event handler to avoid it being garbage collected. This can be accomplished by having a private field and assigning the handler as the value before or after attaching to this event. Yet the sample implementation of RelayCommand does not maintain any such to the subscribed handler: public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
{
    add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; }
    remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; }
}
 Does this leak the weak reference up to the RelayCommand's client, requiring that the user of the RelayCommand understand the implementation of CanExecuteChanged and maintain a live reference themselves? If so, does it make sense to, e.g., modify the implementation of RelayCommand to be something like the following to mitigate the potential premature GC of the CanExecuteChanged subscriber: // This event never actually fires.  It's purely lifetime mgm't.
private event EventHandler canExecChangedRef;
public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged
{
    add 
    { 
        CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value;
        this.canExecChangedRef += value;
    }
    remove 
    {
        this.canExecChangedRef -= value;
        CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; 
    }
}

An alternative to this is to override - (NSUInteger)application:(UIApplication *)application supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:(UIWindow *)window
 in your AppDelegate, which overrides the Info.plist. It isn?t possible anymore to set only Portrait in your Info.plist and then having rotation in some ViewController by overriding shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation or supportedInterfaceOrientations.

@TITLE:Can I override the Javascript Function object to log all function calls?
@CONTENT:Can I override the behavior of the Function object so that I can inject behavior prior t every function call, and then carry on as normal? Specifically, (though the general idea is intriguing in itself) can I log to the console every function call without having to insert console.log statements everywhere? And then the normal behavior goes on? I do recognize that this will likely have significant performance problems; I have no intention of having this run typically, even in my development environment. But if it works it seems an elegant solution to get a 1000 meter view on the running code. And I suspect that the answer will show me something deeper about javascript.

@TITLE:Configure Maven to use different JDK for different J2SE versions?
@CONTENT:I want to configure Maven2 to use sun-java6-jdk to build Java SE 1.6 modules, and use openjdk-7 to build Java SE 1.7 modules. Is it possible? Maven2 should then auto choose the correct JDK to build different modules in one command. For example, it should be $ mvn package
 instead of $ cd module1
$ update-alternatives ... jdk6 ...
$ mvn package
...
$ cd module2
$ update-alternatives ... jdk7 ...
$ mvn package
 P.S. It's nothing about pom.xml files, which have already been setup maven-compiler-plugin with different <source>, <target> values for different modules. If I choose to use openjdk-7, Maven2 will generate version 1.6 class files, but using openjdk-7 rather then sun-java6-jdk. The question is about how to configure Java SE profiles.
@CODE:$ mvn package $ cd module1
$ update-alternatives ... jdk6 ...
$ mvn package
...
$ cd module2
$ update-alternatives ... jdk7 ...
$ mvn package maven-compiler-plugin <source> <target>

 I'm not even sure what I want to do is possible, but it would be very nice to be able to automatically output parameter names/values at runtime to a file without explicitly writing the code to log them. Is it possible?

@TITLE:What errors/exceptions do I need to handle with urllib2.Request / urlopen?
@CONTENT:I have the following code to do a postback to a remote URL: request = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com', postBackData, { 'User-Agent' : 'My User Agent' })

try: 
    response = urllib2.urlopen(request)
except urllib2.HTTPError, e:
    checksLogger.error('HTTPError = ' + str(e.code))
except urllib2.URLError, e:
    checksLogger.error('URLError = ' + str(e.reason))
except httplib.HTTPException, e:
    checksLogger.error('HTTPException')
 The postBackData is created using a dictionary encoded using urllib.urlencode. checksLogger is a logger using logging. I have had a problem where this code runs when the remote server is down and the code exits (this is on customer servers so I don't know what the exit stack dump / error is at this time). I'm assuming this is because there is an exception and/or error that is not being handled. So are there any other exceptions that might be triggered that I'm not handling above?
@CODE:request = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com', postBackData, { 'User-Agent' : 'My User Agent' })

try: 
    response = urllib2.urlopen(request)

 This was possible with UIAlertView (but perhaps not quite proper). In this case, how do you present a UIAlertController, right there in myUtilityMethod?

@TITLE:Leverage browser caching in IIS (google pagespeed issue)
@CONTENT:There are several questions about leveraging browser caching but I didn't find anything useful for how to do this in an ASP.NET application. Google's Pagespeed tells this is performance biggest problem. So far I did this in my web.config: <system.webServer>
  <staticContent>
    <!--<clientCache cacheControlMode="UseExpires"
            httpExpires="Fri, 24 Jan 2014 03:14:07 GMT" /> -->
    <clientCache cacheControlMode="UseMaxAge" cacheControlMaxAge="7.24:00:00" />
  </staticContent>
</system.webServer>
 Commented code works. I can set expire header to be some particular time in future but I was not able to set cacheControlMaxAge to set how many days from now static content would be cached. It does not work. My questions is: How can I do that? I know it is possible to set caching only for specific folder which would be good solution, but it isn't working also. Application is hosted on Windows Server 2012,on IIS8, application pool is set to classic. After I set this code in web config I got pagespeed of 72 (before was 71). 50 files were not cached. (Now 49) I was wondering why and I just realized that one file was actually cached (svg file). Unfortunately png and jpg file were not. This is my web.config <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
