@TITLE:Android Phonegap - How to Open Native Google Maps Application
@CONTENT:I'm working on an Android application using Phonegap and am having trouble figuring out how to open the native Google Maps application to display directions. I don't have any issue opening a map by inserting a URL but opening the application has me stumped. So far I have only been able to find Phonegap related suggestions for development on the iOS platform. I have added Google Maps to the whitelist permissions, am including the correct Cordova.js file and google maps link in my script tag, have the correct permissions in my AndroidManifest.xml file, included Cordova.jar and Google Map API in my build path, have the Phonegap xml folder in the res directory, js file in my assets/www directory, jar file in the libs directory. What I am trying to accomplish: 1. When a link is clicked, open the native Google Maps application. If the application is not installed on the device, notify the user that Google Maps is not installed and must be installed. a. I am already checking for network connectivity and handling that as it should be done. 2. Google Maps opens displaying directions from the user's current location to the location of the link clicked. The example below works on my Android device exactly the same as it does on iOS but obviously does not open the actions Google Maps application. <a> href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=TD Washington DC"><img src="img/ico_pin.png" />White House</a></a>
 The second example adds on to the first by including the end location although I wasn't able to figure out how to insert the current location. Most importantly though, it still doesn't open the Google Maps application. <a href="javascript:openMaps('daddr=1600+Pennsylvania+Ave+NW+Washington+DC+20500+USA');"><img src="img/ico_pin.png" />White House</a>

function openMaps(querystring) {
    var maproot = '';
    maproot = 'http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Current+Location&';
    window.location = maproot + querystring;
}
 In the third example below, I'm able to display a map within my application. It does show the correct route (from an overhead view from point A to point B) but again doesn't open the actual Google Maps application. <a id="whDirections" href="#mm_directions" onclick="getDirections()">
                    <img src="img/ico_pin.png" />White House</a>

<div data-role="content">
    <div class="ui-bar-c ui-corner-all ui-shadow" style="padding: 1em;">
        <div id="mapdirections_canvas" style="height: 300px;"></div>
    </div>
</div>

function getDirections() {
    var directionsService = new google.maps.DirectionsService();
    var map;
    var directionsDisplay = new google.maps.DirectionsRenderer();
    var mapOptions = {
        zoom: 9,
        zoomControl: true,
        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
    };
    var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("mapdirections_canvas"), mapOptions);
    directionsDisplay.setMap(map);

    var myLatLng = new google.maps.LatLng(gmmLat, gmmLong);
    if (document.getElementById("whDirections")) {
        var request = {
            origin: myLatLng,
        destination: new google.maps.LatLng(38.897096, -77.036545), 
            travelMode: google.maps.TravelMode.DRIVING
    };
    directionsService.route(request, function(result, status) {
        if (status == google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK) {
            directionsDisplay.setDirections(result); 
        }
    });
}
 If anyone has a link or any idea on this, I would really appreciate the help. Other than a 'Hello World' app, this is my first mobile application. Please let me know if I have missed anything or if I am just doing this completely wrong. If any additional information is needed, please let me know. Thanks in advance for the help.

@LINK:/questions/15047281/use-liipimaginebundle-to-resize-image-after-upload
@TITLE:Use LiipImagineBundle to Resize Image after Upload?
@CONTENT:I'm using the LiipImagineBundle with Symfony 2.1 and would like to resize user uploaded images upon upload before saving them to the permanent filesystem location (to strip metadata, impose jpeg format, and limit the size of the file). I have to call a 'strip' and 'resize' filter from the controller and then save the filtered image from a temporary location to a folder of my choosing in the filesystem. I tried to use the LiipImageBundle Controller as a service as indicated in the bundle's readme but the called Action is mainly for creating a filtered image in the cache directory when a request is made to display the image (using it for filtering during uploading is another case). I tried to implement it as follows anyways, and got it to work. I had to first move the file from the web server's php temporary directory to a directory in the web folder to be able to apply the filter. Secondly, I applied the filter and deleted (unlink()) the initial unfiltered file. Lastly, I had to move (rename()) the filtered file to the permanent location in the filesystem. It was necessary to move the file twice, apply the filter once, and delete (unlink) 1 file to make it all work. Is there a better way (not requiring the intermediate move) to use the bundle at upload? class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function new_imageAction(Request $request)
    {
        $uploadedFile = $request->files->get('file');
        $tmpFolderPathAbs = $this->get('kernel')->getRootDir() . '/../web/uploads/tmp/';
        $tmpImageNameNoExt = rand();
        $tmpImageName = $tmpImageNameNoExt . '.' . $fileExtension;
        $uploadedFile->move($tmpFolderPathAbs, $tmpImageName);
        $tmpImagePathRel = '/uploads/tmp/' . $tmpImageName;
        // Create the filtered image in a tmp folder:
        $this->container->get('liip_imagine.controller')->filterAction($request, $tmpImagePathRel, 'my_filter');
        unlink($tmpFolderPathAbs . $tmpImageName);
        $filteredImagePathAbs = $this->get('kernel')->getRootDir() . '/../web/uploads/cache/my_filter/uploads/tmp/' . $tmpImageNameNoExt . '.jpeg';
        $imagePath = $imageManagerResponse->headers->get('location');
        // define permanent location ($permanentImagePathAbs)...
        rename($filteredImagePathAbs, $permanentImagePathAbs);
    }
}
 My filter in the app/config/config.yml is as follows: liip_imagine:
    filter_sets:
        my_filter:
            format: jpeg
            filters:
                strip: ~
                thumbnail: { size: [1600, 1000], mode: inset }
 A similar question was asked for the ImagineAvalancheBundle but no much details are given. Perhaps implementing another service from the here provided list is a better solution?
@CODE:class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function new_imageAction(Request $request)
    {
        $uploadedFile = $request->files->get('file');
        $tmpFolderPathAbs = $this->get('kernel')->getRootDir() . '/../web/uploads/tmp/';
        $tmpImageNameNoExt = rand();

        $uploadedFile->move($tmpFolderPathAbs, $tmpImageName);
        $tmpImagePathRel = '/uploads/tmp/' . $tmpImageName;
        // Create the filtered image in a tmp folder:
        $this->container->get('liip_imagine.controller')->filterAction($request, $tmpImagePathRel, 'my_filter');
        unlink($tmpFolderPathAbs . $tmpImageName);
        $filteredImagePathAbs = $this->get('kernel')->getRootDir() . '/../web/uploads/cache/my_filter/uploads/tmp/' . $tmpImageNameNoExt . '.jpeg';

@TITLE:AngularJS - how to force a scope to update (promise for array item)
@CONTENT:I've created a controller in Angular that looks like this (edited for brevity): function AppCtrl($scope, $http, $location, $dataService) {
    $scope.projects = $dataService.data.projects;
}
 Which correctly loads the $scope.projects promise from my $dataService service. app.service('$dataService', function($q, $http, $location, $rootScope) {
    var dataService = this; //Provides access 'this' inside functions below
    var projectsDeferred = $q.defer();

    $http.get('/api').success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
        projectsDeferred.resolve(data.projects);
    }).error(function(err) {
        projectsDeferred.reject(err);
    });

    this.data = {projects: projectsDeferred.promise};

    //UPDATE FUNCTION
    function updateObjectInArray(array, object, newData) {
        for(i in array) {
            if(array[i] == object) {
                if(newData != undefined) {
                    array[i] = newData;
                } else {
                    return array[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return undefined;
    }


    this.updateProject = function(project, updateData) {
        $http.put('/api/projects/' + project._id, updateData)
            .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
            updateObjectInArray(dataService.data.projects.$$v, project, data);
        }).error(function(data, status, headers, config) {});
    };

});
 I've created another controller that looks like this, that selects a single project from the array of projects based on the current URL: function ProjectCtrl($scope, $route) {
    //Getting the current project from the array of projects
    $scope.project = $scope.projects.then(function(projects) {
        for(i in projects) {
            if(projects[i]._id == $route.current.params.projectId) {
                return projects[i];
            }
        }
    });
}
 When I try to run my updateObjectInArray() function (on the success of my $http.put() request), my $scope.projects in AppCtrl is correctly updated (the array of projects) but my $scope.project in ProjectCtrl is not updated. I can log array[i] inside the updateObjectInArray() function and it will log exactly what I expect, and I can log $scope.projects in AppCtrl and it will update accordingly, but when I try to log $scope.project in my ProjectCtrl controller, it isn't updated accordingly. I thought the reason was because I had to call $rootScope.$apply() or $rootScope.$digest() after I updated the array[i] object in updateObjectInArray(), however, I get the error that $digest is already in progress. What do I need to do to make sure my $scope.project item in the array gets updated in my ProjectCtrl? Do I need to resolve a new promise for it?
@CODE:function AppCtrl($scope, $http, $location, $dataService) {
    $scope.projects = $dataService.data.projects;
} $scope.projects $dataService app.service('$dataService', function($q, $http, $location, $rootScope) {
    var dataService = this; //Provides access 'this' inside functions below
    var projectsDeferred = $q.defer();

    $http.get('/api').success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
        projectsDeferred.resolve(data.projects);
    }).error(function(err) {
        projectsDeferred.reject(err);
    });

    this.data = {projects: projectsDeferred.promise};

    //UPDATE FUNCTION
    function updateObjectInArray(array, object, newData) {
        for(i in array) {
            if(array[i] == object) {
                if(newData != undefined) {
                    array[i] = newData;
                } else {
                    return array[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return undefined;
    }


    this.updateProject = function(project, updateData) {

@TITLE:iOS - UISplitViewController with storyboard - multiple master views and multiple detail views
@CONTENT:I'm trying to put together an iPad app using UISplitViewController and storyboards. The master view starts with a navigation controller linked to a table view of 6 menu options. Each cell in the table pushes a different table view controller onto the navigation stack. This is working fine for the master view. Each master view has a table list which when clicked needs to display a different view controller in the detail pane. I've currently done this with a segue set to 'Replace' and 'Detail Split' which works the first time a row is clicked, but as soon as you click another row in the master view, or rotate the device then the app crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS. I'm fairly sure my problems are to do with how the delegate is setup for the UISplitViewController. I'm confused as to how this should be used when I have multiple master VCs and multiple detail VCs. Where should the delegate code be placed - master or detail? Do I have to implement the UISplitViewControllerDelegate protocol events in every view controller? Any help appreciated.

@TITLE:How can I use PHP's various XML libraries to get DOM-like functionality and avoid DoS vulnerabilities, like Billion Laughs or Quadratic Blowup?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a web application that has an XML API in PHP, and I'm worried about three specific vulnerabilities, all related to inline DOCTYPE definitions: local file inclusion, quadratic entity blowup, and exponential entity blowup. I'd love to use PHP's (5.3) built in libraries, but I want to make sure I'm not susceptible to these. I found I can eliminate LFI with libxml_disable_entity_loader, but this doesn't help with inline ENTITY declarations, including entities that refer to other entities. The SimpleXML library (SimpleXMLElement, simplexml_load_string, etc) is great because it's a DOM parser and all my inputs are fairly small; it allows me to use xpath and manipulate the DOM pretty easily. I can't figure how to stop ENTITY declarations. (I would be happy to disable all inline DOCTYPE definitions, if possible.) The XML Parser library (xml_parser_create, xml_set_element_handler, etc) allows me to set the default handler, which includes entities, with xml_set_default_handler. I can hack it so for unrecognized entities it simply returns the original string (ie, "&ent;"). This library is frustrating though: because it is a SAX parser I have to write a bunch of handlers (as many as 9..). So is it possible to use the built in libraries, get DOM-like objects out, and protect myself from these various DoS vulnerabilities? thanks This page describes the three vulnerabilities, and provides a solution...if only I were using .NET: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx UPDATE: <?php

But, browser-length cookies (cookies that expire as soon as the user closes his or her browser) don't have a expire time, then SESSION_COOKIE_AGE has no effects (Yes, I check it).

However, once I build for production the following code just doesn't want to run. It doesn't hit either block complete nor failed. I have also tried using selectors, with a delegate but those do not get called either. __block __weak ASIHTTPRequest *request = [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL:URL];
[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(startSpinner) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:NO];

[request setCompletionBlock:^{

I'm not lazy, I'm only asking for code because I don't want to reinvent the wheel trying to do an algorithm that is already done. Edit: it's important know how many times each n-gram appears.

@TITLE:Gaussian filter with OpenGL Shaders
@CONTENT:I am trying to learn Shaders to implement something in my iPhone app. So far I have understood easy examples like making a color image to gray scale, thresholding, etc. Most of the examples involve simple operations in where processing input image pixel I(x,y) results in a simple modification of the colors of the same pixel But, how about Convolutions?. For example, the easiest example would the Gaussian filter, in where output image pixel O(x,y) depends not only on I(x,y) but also on surrounding 8 pixels. O(x,y) = (I(x,y)+ surrounding 8 pixels values)/9;
 Normally, this cannot be done with one single image buffer or input pixels will change as the filter is performed. How can I do this with shaders? Also, should I handle the borders myself? or there is a built-it function or something that check invalid pixel access like I(-1,-1) ?

@TITLE:How to tile and scroll a large image (10000x10000) in android
@CONTENT:I am working in a map project in android. It contains larger image of 10000x10000 resolution. Using this image with Bitmap it gives OutOfMemoryError. So I want to tile and scroll this image. When I scroll image, only visible screen must have tiles and other invisible tiles must be recycled. I spent lots of time but didn't find anything. Any help will be appreciated. Provide me better solutions or idea.

@TITLE:How do I use a service to monitor Orientation change in Android
@CONTENT:I'm writing a Widget that will display a countdown timer. I have the widget working the way I want it until I flip the phone from landscape to portrait. My widget does not update and goes to it's initial state at start of the widget until an onupdate is called by my recurring alarm. I would like to call an onupdate manually once the orientation changes to update my widget I've been researching this for a while now and I've found out that I need to use a Service which will monitor the orientation changes and call my onupdate for my widget. My problem is I can't find a straight answer as to how to use a service to monitor the change. I've seen that with an activity I can add android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden" to the manifest for an activity and use a onConfigurationChanged, but can I do this for a service. If so how? Is there a better way to monitor the orientation change? I've also read on the internet that a service isn't the best way to do this either. I've seen tutorials for creating orientation listeners but they seem to use depreciated function calls. Thanks in Advance

@LINK:/questions/3588779/obtaining-admin-privileges-to-delete-files-using-rm-from-a-cocoa-app
@TITLE:Obtaining admin privileges to delete files using rm from a Cocoa app
@CONTENT:I am making a small app that deletes log files. I am using an NSTask instance which runs rm and srm (secure rm) to delete files. I want to be able to delete files in: /Library/Logs ~/Library/Logs The issue is that the user account does not have permissions to access some files in the system library folder, such as the Adobe logs subfolder and others. For example, only the "system" user (group?) has r/w permissions for the Adobe logs folder and its contents, and the current user doesn't even have an entry in the permissions shown in the Get Info window for the folder. What I want to be able to do exactly: Obtain admin privileges. Store the password in the Keychain so the app doesn't have to nag the user each time (Is the storage of the password a bad idea? Is it possible?) Delete a file whatever the file permissions may be. I am using NSTask because it offers notifications for task completion, getting text output from the task itself, etc. Would I need to use something else? If so, how could I replicate NSTask's completion notifications and output file handle while running rm and srm with admin privileges? I am looking for the most secure way to handle the situation. i.e. I don't want my application to become a doorway for privilege escalation attacks. I looked at the Authorization Services Programming Guide but I am not sure which case fits. At first I thought that AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges would be a good idea but after reading more on the subject it looks like this method is not recommended for security reasons. A detailed answer would be very welcome. I'm sure some of you already had to do something similar and have some code and knowledge to share. Thanks in advance! Update: I am now able to make the authentication dialog pop up and obtain privileges, like so: OSStatus status;
AuthorizationRef authRef;
    status = AuthorizationCreate(NULL, kAuthorizationEmptyEnvironment, kAuthorizationFlagDefaults, &authRef);

AuthorizationRights authRights;
AuthorizationItem authItems[1];

authItems[0].name = kAuthorizationRightExecute;

authRights.count = sizeof(authItems) / sizeof(authItems[0]);
authRights.items = authItems;

AuthorizationFlags authFlags = kAuthorizationFlagDefaults | kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights | kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed;

status = AuthorizationCopyRights(authRef, &authRights, kAuthorizationEmptyEnvironment, authFlags, NULL);
 From the looks of it, it seems that the "Factored Application" method looks the most appropriate. The thing is that, to me, rm already seems like an external helper tool. I'm not sure I get the setuid alternative suggested in the documentation. Could I set the setuid bit on rm and run it using the NSTask method I already implemented? This would mean that I wouldn't need to create my own helper tool. Could somebody elaborate on this subject? I also looked at the BetterAuthorizationSample which is suggested as a more secure and recent alternative to the setuid bit method, but found it awfully complex for such as simple behavior. Any hints? Thanks in advance for any help!

@LINK:/questions/3484591/common-strategies-when-defining-spring-beans-for-different-environments
@TITLE:Common strategies when defining Spring beans for different environments
@CONTENT:What are common strategies for defining a bunch of beans, which are used differently in development and production environments? Let's say I have 2 beans, each implementing the same interface. One bean serves as abstraction for local filesystem, the other connects to a distributed filesystem. To keep the development as steady, as possible, the development environment should use local filesystem implementation, the production release uses distributed filesystem bean. Currently what I'm doing is having two xml definitions. native.xml <bean id="resourceSystem" class="com.cust.NativeResourceSystem" />
 distributed.xml <bean id="resourceSystem" class="com.cust.HadoopResourceSystem">
    <constructor-arg name="fs" ref="hdfs" />
</bean>
 When creating application context I omit either native.xml or distributed.xml depending on environment and grab the resourceSystem bean. Are there any proper tools or best practices in Spring to configure bean definitions for different environments? Thanks.
@CODE:<bean id="resourceSystem" class="com.cust.NativeResourceSystem" /> <bean id="resourceSystem" class="com.cust.HadoopResourceSystem">

@LINK:/questions/2272378/android-using-method-from-a-service-in-an-activity
@TITLE:Android - Using method from a Service in an Activity?
@CONTENT:I have the folowing method in a Service in my appplication: public void switchSpeaker(boolean speakerFlag){

        if(speakerFlag){
        audio_service.setSpeakerphoneOn(false);
        }
        else{
        audio_service.setSpeakerphoneOn(true);
        }

    }
 So my question is whats the best and most effective way to be able to use this method in an Activity like follows final Button speaker_Button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.widget36);

            speaker_Button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
                public void onClick(View v){

                    switchSpeaker(true); //method from Service

                }

            });
 Do I have to do an AIDL or is there a simpler way?
@CODE:public void switchSpeaker(boolean speakerFlag){

        if(speakerFlag){
        audio_service.setSpeakerphoneOn(false);
        }
        else{
        audio_service.setSpeakerphoneOn(true);
        }

    } final Button speaker_Button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.widget36);

            speaker_Button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
                public void onClick(View v){

                    switchSpeaker(true); //method from Service

@TITLE:OAuth + Twitter on Android: Callback fails
@CONTENT:My Android application uses Java OAuth library, found here for authorization on Twitter. I am able to get a request token, authorize the token and get an acknowlegement but when the browser tries the call back url to reconnect with my application, it does not use the URL I provide in code, but uses the one I supplied while registering with Twitter. Note: 1. When registering my application with twitter, I provided a hypothetical call back url:http://abz.xyc.com and set the application type as browser. 2.

@TITLE:Hibernate @OneToMany with mappedBy (parent-child) relationship and cache problem
@CONTENT:I have this problem for a long time now, I have searched the web and SO in and out and didn't find a solution yet. I hope you can help me on that. I have a parent-child relationship between two entities like the following: @Entity
public class Parent {
    // ...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)
    private Set<Child> children = new HashSet<Child>();

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Child {
    // ...

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Parent parent;

    // ...
}
 The thing is that when I create a new child and assign it to a parent, the parent doesn't get updated when it is in the cache already.  Parent parent = new Parent();
 em.persist(parent);

 // ...

 Child child = new Child();
 child.setParent(parent);
 em.persist(child);

 parent.getChildren().size(); // returns 0
 I have tried to use @PreUpdate to automatically add the child to the parent when the child is persisted, but in the case when we have 2 entity managers in 2 different threads (like in JBoss), the issue still exists, until we call em.refresh(parent) So the question is - is there a way to smoothly eliminate the problem and ensure that parent.getChildren() always return the up-to-date list of children?
@CODE:@Entity
public class Parent {
    // ...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)
    private Set<Child> children = new HashSet<Child>();

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Child {
    // ...

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Parent parent;

    // ...
} Parent parent = new Parent();
 em.persist(parent);

 // ...

 Child child = new Child();
 child.setParent(parent);
 em.persist(child);

 parent.getChildren().size(); // returns 0 em.refresh(parent) parent.getChildren()

@LINK:/questions/1180240/best-way-to-sort-1m-records-in-python
@TITLE:Best way to sort 1M records in Python
@CONTENT:I have a service that runs that takes a list of about 1,000,000 dictionaries and does the following myHashTable = {}
myLists = { 'hits':{}, 'misses':{}, 'total':{} }
sorted = { 'hits':[], 'misses':[], 'total':[] }
for item in myList:
  id = item.pop('id')
  myHashTable[id] = item
  for k, v in item.iteritems():
    myLists[k][id] = v
 So, if I had the following list of dictionaries: [ {'id':'id1', 'hits':200, 'misses':300, 'total':400},
  {'id':'id2', 'hits':300, 'misses':100, 'total':500},
  {'id':'id3', 'hits':100, 'misses':400, 'total':600}
]
 I end up with myHashTable =
{ 
  'id1': {'hits':200, 'misses':300, 'total':400},
  'id2': {'hits':300, 'misses':100, 'total':500},
  'id3': {'hits':100, 'misses':400, 'total':600}
}
 and myLists = 

    {
      'hits': {'id1':200, 'id2':300, 'id3':100},
      'misses': {'id1':300, 'id2':100, 'id3':400},
      'total': {'id1':400, 'id2':500, 'id3':600}
    }
 I then need to sort all of the data in each of the myLists dictionaries. What I doing currently is something like the following: def doSort(key):
  sorted[key] = sorted(myLists[key].items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)

which would yield, in the case of misses:
[('id3', 400), ('id1', 300), ('id2', 200)]
 This works great when I have up to 100,000 records or so, but with 1,000,000 it is taking at least 5 - 10 minutes to sort each with a total of 16 (my original list of dictionaries actually has 17 fields including id which is popped) * EDIT * This service is a ThreadingTCPServer which has a method allowing a client to connect and add new data. The new data may include new records (meaning dictionaries with unique 'id's to what is already in memory) or modified records (meaning the same 'id' with different data for the other key value pairs So, once this is running I would pass in [
  {'id':'id1', 'hits':205, 'misses':305, 'total':480},
  {'id':'id4', 'hits':30, 'misses':40, 'total':60},
  {'id':'id5', 'hits':50, 'misses':90, 'total':20
]
 I have been using dictionaries to store the data so that I don't end up with duplicates. After the dictionaries are updated with the new/modified data I resort each of them. * END EDIT * So, what is the best way for me to sort these? Is there a better method?
@CODE:myHashTable = {}
myLists = { 'hits':{}, 'misses':{}, 'total':{} }
sorted = { 'hits':[], 'misses':[], 'total':[] }
for item in myList:
  id = item.pop('id')
  myHashTable[id] = item
  for k, v in item.iteritems():
    myLists[k][id] = v [ {'id':'id1', 'hits':200, 'misses':300, 'total':400},
  {'id':'id2', 'hits':300, 'misses':100, 'total':500},
  {'id':'id3', 'hits':100, 'misses':400, 'total':600}
] myHashTable =
{ 
  'id1': {'hits':200, 'misses':300, 'total':400},
  'id2': {'hits':300, 'misses':100, 'total':500},
  'id3': {'hits':100, 'misses':400, 'total':600}
} myLists = 

    {
      'hits': {'id1':200, 'id2':300, 'id3':100},
      'misses': {'id1':300, 'id2':100, 'id3':400},
      'total': {'id1':400, 'id2':500, 'id3':600}

@TITLE:Interact with a Windows console application via Python
@CONTENT:I am using python 2.5 on Windows. I wish to interact with a console process via Popen. I currently have this small snippet of code: p = Popen( ["console_app.exe"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE )
# issue command 1...

result1 = p.stdout.read() # <---- we never return here
# issue command 2...
p.stdin.write( 'command2\n' )
result2 = p.stdout.read()
 I can write to stdin but can not read from stdout. Have I missed a step? I don't want to use p.communicate( "command" )[0] as it terminates the process and I need to interact with the process dynamically over time. Thanks in advance.

I'd also prefer it to be as3 but any others will do also. May need to elaborate a little.. I'm actually looking for a framework to allow me to create my own GUIs in flash, custom skins, colors, styles, etc.

@CONTENT:I need to issue an HTTP Get with a query string to a web service from Excel for Mac 2011. I've seen the answers for using QueryTables (How can I send an HTTP POST request to a server from Excel using VBA?) but they use the POST method, not a GET method. I also see that it's easy from a Windows machine, but I'm stuck on a Mac. Any suggestions, or is it hopeless?

@TITLE:Highlight a specified route on Google Maps v2 Android
@CONTENT:Right, so I'm currently using the Google Directions API in my app to retrieve the route between two locations. When I send a request for a route directions, I retrieve a number of details in JSON regarding the route including the names of every road along the route, their corresponding start and end lat-long co-ordinates, and their polyline value. For example: If I send the request http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=redfern+ave,+dublin&destination=limetree+ave,+dublin&sensor=false between two roads, I get the following JSON response (output for one road along route).  {
                     "distance" : {
                        "text" : "0.2 km",
                        "value" : 203
                     },
                     "duration" : {
                        "text" : "1 min",
                        "value" : 18
                     },
                     "end_location" : {
                        "lat" : 53.435250,
                        "lng" : -6.132140000000001
                     },
                     "html_instructions" : "Head \u003cb\u003eeast\u003c/b\u003e on \u003cb\u003eRedfern Ave.\u003c/b\u003e toward \u003cb\u003eMartello Court\u003c/b\u003e",

                     },
 So far my application parses this information and simply lists the roads and directions in a list view like this: What I want to do it highlight the whole route from A to B on a map, however I've found nothing useful online on how to do this on the new Google Maps API v2. I see that polyline's are used instead of overlays to draw lines on Google Maps v2, however from what I can tell, they only draw straight lines which is useless for me. Is there anyway of highlighting the route using the information I have at my disposal (road names, start & end lat-long co-ordinates, polyline points? Any help is appreciated. Also, I see there is a 'polyline' value in the response which could be useful but I can't work out how to parse or use this bit of information. Does anyone know how I can make sense of this value to plot a polyline? **"polyline" : {
             "points" : "woceIvgmd@O}DOkDQqF"**
 EDIT: My solution code is provided in my answer below.

@CONTENT:I'm looking for tips on how to implement the popular 'paper folding / origami' effect in my iOS project. I'm aware of projects such as: https://github.com/xyfeng/XYOrigami but they only offer the 'animated' effect, with no manual control over the opening animation. I've struggled to dissect that project and come up with what I'm after.

@CONTENT:I'm a little confused about the limitations of using SQLite in a Phonegap-Native-App on iOS. You can read many posts about the limit of 5mb storage and the fact, that your Ipad can ask you to increase the storage. Now I've managed to insert nearly 7000 rows into my SQLite database, using the usual Phonegap-Storage-API. The corresponding db-file has a size of 26 MB. A following select-statement "select * from " worked and was showing the db's content. I've done that in the simulator and on the device. I didn't get the question to increase the storage. How can that be? Do I misunderstand something? Is there really a 5mb limit for SQLite dbs in Phonegap? I'm using Phonegap 1.2 and iOS 5.

@CONTENT:I would like to write a console application that automatically posts information to my wall once every morning. I have signed up for facebook developer and have a AppID and App Secret I have been trying to play with the C# facebook SDK and looked through several examples. Seems like the examples get a user token - but have to use a browser that is in windows forms. This is an automated process - so I dont want to have a user present. Ive also created some examples using the application token - but it does not seem to be able to write to the wall. I wrote the Twitter equivalent very quickly. I must be missing something here ??? What is the proper way to proceed? It seems that all I should need to is: FaceBookClient(appID, appSecret) and then just FaceBookClient.Put(message) ??? clarification added: Playing with the C# facebook sdk winform application I had to change their FacebookLoginDialog.cs to use the folling URL: https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=APPID&client_secret=APPSECRET&scope=user_about_me,publish_stream,offline_access which returns an accesskey in WebBrowser.DocumentText If I then call:             var fb = new FacebookClient(_accessToken);
            dynamic parameters = new ExpandoObject();
            parameters.message = "Hello World!";
            dynamic result = fb.Post("me/feed", parameters);
 I get the exception: (OAuthException) An active access token must be used to query information about the current user. If I change the code above to NOT use that access token - but use the appID and Appsecret:            FacebookClient myFacebookClient = new FacebookClient("APPID", "APPSECRET");
            dynamic parameters = new ExpandoObject();
            parameters.message = "Hello World!";
            dynamic result = myFacebookClient.Post("me/feed", parameters);
 Then I get the exception: (OAuthException) An active access token must be used to query information about the current user. I guess it is the same exception

@TITLE:android compass seems unreliable
@CONTENT:I have been working on a small compass app the past couple of days, and have gotten the code up and running, but it seems that the compass reading is not accurate. After calibrating both phones, my first test that i found this in what that i simply held the phone against and flat surface looked at the reading then flipped it horizontally and put it against the same flat surface (a 180* turn) and the value did not change 180* it was closer to 240*. I then tested the reading vs a compass, at times the reading seemed to be close but at other points it was more than 50* off. I even tried to put my phone and compass on the floor to keep the compasses away from any magnetic interference with the same results (note i also keep the compass and phone apart keeping them in the same direction by lining up with edges of a book). I then put the sample application on another phone (first was nexus S, second was Motorola droid 1). Between the two phones the difference ranges from being equal at some points but at most points being between 50 and 15 degrees off. I have looked through the documentation and also looked through many different forum posts and I do not see anyone with the same results. There may be some small error in my code that is causing my reading to come out incorrectly, or some documented bug that I am not seeing. Any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! Heres my on sensor changed code in my SensorEventListener class public void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event)
    {
        // If the sensor data is unreliable return
        if (event.accuracy == SensorManager.SENSOR_STATUS_UNRELIABLE)

 Thanks in advance! Edit: also tried it with the droid X with the worst results yet... When the phone is rolled around 45 degrees (rotated around z axis a computer coordinate system) the compass heading returned can change over 180 degrees, in fact the heading value goes in the opposite direction of the other phones when spun in the same direction. This is the only phone that produces this result even after calibrating in the settings. Also their is a compass live wallpaper i test against that doesnt have the same issue. So I would assume there would be something i can do in software to avoid this.

But when I try to load a full size picture (2336x3504), the image will not load. The file size of the image is only 2mb. I do not get any errors in logcat and there are no exceptions thrown. It simply won't load the image. I also tried using this: BitmapFactory.Options options=new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inSampleSize = 8;
Bitmap preview_bitmap=BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is,null,options);
 This doesn't do anything to help load the large files, but it does resize the smaller image (like it is suppose to). I did add the large picture to my resources and tested it as if it was embedded in the app and it worked fine, just won't work on the server. I have been working all day on this and can't seem to figure out how to load these large pictures. Can anyone help me out with this? Thanks for any info. Here is the link where I found the above code and have been playing with the other examples but still not getting it to work.

    URL myFileUrl = null;

    try {

 And this is my controller implementation: //file TestController.java
public interface TestController {

    public List<Test> findAll();

}

//file TestControllerImp.java
@Controller
public class TestControllerImp implements TestController{

    @Autowired
    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    /**
     * @return the sessionFactory
     */
    public SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
        return sessionFactory;
    }

    /**
     * @param sessionFactory the sessionFactory to set
     */
    public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        this.sessionFactory=sessionFactory;
    }

    @Transactional
    public List<Test> findAll() {
        return sessionFactory.getCurrentSession().createQuery("from Test").list();
    }

}
 Both are inside package called test. This is my try: TestController tc=context.getBean(TestController.class);
List<Test> list=tc.findAll();
 But this throw an exception: org.hibernate.HibernateException: createQuery is not valid without active transaction Why transactionManager doesn't work? I hope with @Transactional annotation all transactions will be managed by spring framework. What can i do? Thanks all.

@TITLE:How to retrieve missed calls on Android SDK 2.2
@CONTENT:in my app I should do some action when a call comes but not answered by the user. I have searched in the android.telephony and the NotificationManager, but I haven't found a method to solve this problem. Does someone have an idea of how to get to know if there is a missed call on the phone or not ?

@LINK:/questions/3305613/using-grid-and-ggplot2-to-create-join-plots-using-r
@TITLE:using grid and ggplot2 to create join plots using R
@CONTENT:I would like to know what can I do to fix a grid of plots. The plots are arranged in an array so that all the plots in a row have the same Y axis variable and all the plots in a column have the same X axis variable. When joined together in a grid this creates a multiplot. I disable the labels on most of the plots excepting the outer ones, since the inner ones have the same variable and scale. However, since the outer plots have labels and axis values, they result in a different size from the other ones. I was thinking of adding 2 more columns and rows to the grid, for the variable names and the axis range values... then plotting only the variable names on the corresponding grid space and the axis values on another grid space, therefore only plotting the points in the remaining space and getting equal sizes. EDIT 1: Thanks to rcs for pointing me toward align.plot Edited align.plot to accept null values (for when having title/text in the axis isnt desired) Now I'm closer to the goal but the first columun plots are still smaller width than the rest due to the labels. example code: grid_test <- function ()
{

@TITLE:UITabBarController, MoreNavigationController and the Holy Grail of Device Rotation
@CONTENT:UPDATE: See my answer to this question first. This appears to be a bug. A minimal test case has been created and a report has been filed with Apple. (Fixed as of iPhone OS 3.1.) Here's a puzzler from the "I'm so close!" department. I have a Tab Bar-based iPhone app. Each tab features a UINavigationController with the usual suspects (nav bar, table view ... which in turn can lead to another VC, etc.). Now, one of those lower-level VCs is to be used in portait and landscape modes. But there's a problem. Our landscape-friendly VC's shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: won't get called out-of-the-box! What to do? Here's what we do. In my Tab Bar Controller, which I have implemented in its own file, I have this: - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {
     return [self.selectedViewController shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:interfaceOrientation];
}
 This ends up propagating the request to my landscape-friendly VC, which also responds to this message. All my other VCs don't implement this method, so they simply go with the default portrait orientation. Problem solved!!! Yay! Well, not quite. :( Seems like things don't go so well when my landscape-friendly VC is invoked from within the depths of the tab bar controller's MoreNavigationController. I decided to compare/contrast between a VC called from within one of the first four tab bar UINavigationControllers ... and that same VC called from within the MoreNavigationController. This is going to be a bit ultra-detailed, so bear with me. Hopefully the play by play proves useful for sleuthing things out. When the app loads, there are several initial calls to the tab bar controller's shouldAutorotate... method. In these early cases, selectedViewController is nil. However, we eventually finish loading, the initial tab item is selected, and all is well. Right. First, let's pick one of the first four tab bar items and drill down to our VC. We'll pick third nav bar item, so that's the third nav controller. We drill down to our VC that supports rotation. A quick inspection confirms that the parent is indeed the third nav controller from our tab bar's view controller list. Good! Let's rotate the device. The tab bar controller is asked to autorotate (see the above code). We observe that selectedViewController is also that third nav controller, plus the nav controller's top and visible view controllers are both set to our trusty VC that supports rotation. Thus, the tab bar controller will forward the shouldAutorotate message over to the third nav controller ... but our rotation-friendly VC ultimately gets the message. (I'm not doing anything special here. Maybe the desired VC gets the message because it's the top and/or visible VC?) In any event, we rotate to landscape, things are resized, and all is well. "Great Success!" Now let's hit that back button and pop the VC stack, leaving landscape mode in the process. The tab bar controller is queried again. Time for a little aside here. The topViewController for our nav controller is still that rotation-friendly VC, but visibleViewController is now set to UISnapshotModalViewController! Heh. Never saw this one before ... but Erica Sadun has. Looks like it's for "disappearing view controllers" (which in this case is certainly true - it's disappearing alright). As I keep stepping through, the visible VC stays as Snapshot, but the top VC eventually changes to the next VC on the stack, since my special VC is eventually gone. Fair enough. So that's the scenario where everything works well. Now let's try the same test, only this time we're going to go to the MoreNavigationController (the More tab bar item) and drill down to the same VC class as before. In my case it happens to be the 7th one in the tab bar controller's VC list. We enter the rotation-aware VC and ... this time it gets asked to rotate directly! The Tab Bar Controller is not asked for permission to rotate at all. Hmm. A quick check of the parent VC shows it is a MoreNavigationController. OK, that makes sense. Now let's try to rotate the device. NOTHING GETS CALLED. None of our breakpoints get hit. Not in our VC. Not in our tab bar controller. (Huh?!?!) O-kaaaay. Let's pop the stack, go back into the same VC and try to rotate again. Weird. NOW we get a call in the Tab Bar Controller asking for autorotation permission. Here, the selected Controller is our trusty Nav controller (#7), but this time its visibleViewController and topViewController are SET TO NIL! Once we continue from here, a mysterious message appears in the debugger console: Using two-stage rotation animation. To use the smoother single-stage animation, this application must remove two-stage method implementations. Mysterious because I'm not using two-stage rotation animation! No SecondHalf method variants are in play anywhere in my source code. Alas, my rotation-aware VC is never told that rotation is occurring (even though rotation does occur on-screen), so of course my view is all fouled up as a result. Mayhem and sadness ensue. :( We won't even bother popping the stack at this point. I think the View Controller doc hints at the possible problem: If you want to perform custom animations during an orientation change, you can do so in one of two ways. Orientation changes used to occur in two steps, with notifications occurring at the beginning, middle, and end points of the rotation. However, in iPhone OS 3.0, support was added for performing orientation changes in one step. Using a one-step orientation change tends to be faster than the older two-step process and is generally recommended for any new code. I wonder if MoreNavigationController is still responding to the two-step process, and is thus tripping up any attempts to use the one-step process? Note that, if you respond to the two-step messages, the one-step variant will not work (again, per the docs). I'm not responding to them, but I have a sneaking suspicion something behind-the-scenes IS. In fact, if I comment out the single-step method, and try to respond to willAnimateSecondHalfOfRotationFromInterfaceOrientation:duration:, I do get the memo! But it still doesn't pop off the stack very cleanly (in terms of visuals). Even stranger: willAnimateFirstHalfOfRotationFromInterfaceOrientation:duration: is NOT called, even when I tried to sneak a call to self (using the FirstHalf message) in shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:. It returns immediately during a trace, as if I never even defined it. Sigh. So that's the play-by-play. In summary, has anyone successfully handled one-step device rotation for a VC invoked from within a Tab Bar Controller's MoreNavigationController? Inquiring minds want to know!

@TITLE:socat: tunnel IP through TTY
@CONTENT:Is it possible to get an bidirectional IP-tunnel over ttyS0-like serial (modem) devices with the socat utility? I tried to use TUN option but still can't get the result. Any suggestions are welcome :) Update: PC1: socat /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,b57600,clocal TUN:192.168.1.1/24,up
 PC2: socat /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,b57600,clocal TUN:192.168.1.2/24,up
 After that, I have seen tun0 interfaces with proper addresses on both ends but I can't ping one from other. Instead of that, when I send data with ping -c 1 192.168.1.1 remote socat process exits and it's tun0 device destroyed. Any suggestions?.. Update2: There is a framing problem when we try to make TCP/IP tunnel over serial with only socat. Gerhard Rieger, the socat's developer, says me that: I am afraid that you are right. tun over datagram socket works, and - by luck - also over pipes. But over the serial line the packet boundaries may vanish and this is fatal when sending the data out on the tun interface. I cannot offer a socat based solution now, sorry. However, I will try to integrate some framing in a later version 2 release.

@LINK:/questions/1340938/memory-leak-when-calling-java-code-from-c-using-jni
@TITLE:Memory leak when calling java code from C using JNI
@CONTENT:I have a C program that stores some object in java store using JNI. (Before someone ask, using java store is a requirment here and I have to write a client in C which would be able to add and retrieve objects from this store). I made the program and tried to add 100000 object of size 1KB. But after adding only 50000 objects I am getting 'out of memory' messages (please note that I am printing these 'out of memory' messages whenever I am unable to allocate a new string or byte array using NewStringUTF and NewByteArray functions). At that time my application is using only 80MB of memory. I dont why these methods are returning NULL. Is there something I am missing. Furthermore, the memory keeps on increasing even though I am releasing byte array and string created for java. Here is the source code.     void create_jvm(void)
{
	JavaVMInitArgs vm_args;		
	JavaVMOption vm_options;

	vm_options.optionString = "-Djava.class.path=c:\\Store";
	vm_args.version = JNI_VERSION_1_4;
	vm_args.nOptions = 1;
	vm_args.options = &vm_options;
	vm_args.ignoreUnrecognized = 0;

	JNI_CreateJavaVM(&jvm, (void**)&env, &vm_args);

	if(env != null)
	{
		j_store = (*env)->FindClass(env, "com/store");
		if(j_store == null)
		{
			printf("unable to find class. class name: JStore");
		}		
	}	
}

void add(char* key, char* value, int length)
{
	jstring j_key = (*env)->NewStringUTF(env, key);
	jbyteArray j_value = (*env)->NewByteArray(env, length);

	(*env)->SetByteArrayRegion(env, j_value, 0, length, (jbyte *)value);
	ret = (*env)->CallStaticBooleanMethod(env, j_store, method_id, j_key, j_value);

	if(j_value != null)
	{
		(*env)->ReleaseByteArrayElements(env, j_value, (jbyte *)value, 0);
	}
	if(j_key != null)
	{
		(*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, j_key, key);
	}
}
 The java side recieves the data in byte[] and stores it in a hashtable. The issue is that everytime the code runs the memory only adds up and is never released. I tried to add 1 MB object and debugged it. The process memory increases by 1MB when I call NewByteArray. But when CallStaticBooleanMethod is called the process memory increase by 4MB. And the call to ReleaseByteArrayElements do not release any memory at all. If I add another 1MB object after this, then process memory remains same when I call NewByteArray and it increase by 1MB when I call CallStaticBooleanMethod but remains the same when I try to release the byte array.
@CODE:void create_jvm(void)
{
	JavaVMInitArgs vm_args;

	vm_args.nOptions = 1;
	vm_args.options = &vm_options;

(I want to use long background running to keep track of a location, my code here simply just use a counter for testing purposes) Anyone can help point out what the problem is? Implementing Long-Running Background Tasks For tasks that require more execution time to implement, you must request specific permissions to run them in the background without their being suspended. In iOS, only specific app types are allowed to run in the background: Apps that play audible content to the user while in the background, such as a music player app Apps that keep users informed of their location at all times, such as a navigation app Apps that support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Newsstand apps that need to download and process new content Apps that receive regular updates from external accessories Apps that implement these services must declare the services they support and use system frameworks to implement the relevant aspects of those services. Declaring the services lets the system know which services you use, but in some cases it is the system frameworks that actually prevent your application from being suspended.    - (void)viewDidLoad {

I searched and found the following about creating a new plugin for Stagefright: To add support for a new format, you need to: Develop a new Extractor class, if the container is not supported yet. Develop a new Decoder class, that implements the interface needed by the StageFright core to read the data. Associate the mime-type of the files to read to your new Decoder in the OMXCodec.cpp file, in the kDecoderInfo array.     static const CodecInfo kDecoderInfo[] = {  
        {MEDIA_MIMETYPE_AUDIO_AAC, "OMX.TI.AAC.decode"},
        {MEDIA_MIMETYPE_AUDIO_AAC, "AACDecoder"},
    };
 The above data is all i could find out on net. Right now i have a simple app that will take a file as an input and render it on the screen using native API's in android. Can anyone please tell me how to proceed further. And from where does all these OMXCodec.cpp and others come into picture and which directory of my project should i have them in. Please provide solutions regarding the same. Thanks in advance.
@CODE:Stagefright Stagefright StageFright OMXCodec.cpp kDecoderInfo static const CodecInfo kDecoderInfo[] = {  
        {MEDIA_MIMETYPE_AUDIO_AAC, "OMX.TI.AAC.decode"},
        {MEDIA_MIMETYPE_AUDIO_AAC, "AACDecoder"},
    }; OMXCodec.cpp

@TITLE:SVG donut slice as path element (annular sector)
@CONTENT:Ok so granted, its not a bug, but I am confounded by how to get a perfect circle arc between points via B?zier curve. I need a shape like this: So I've been calculating the four corner points like this from the center point, radius and angle with the following formula: (x?,y?)=(x+d cos \,y+d sin \), which in my coffeescript looks something like this: x1 = centerPointX+outerRadius*Math.cos(currentAngle)
y1 = centerPointY+outerRadius*Math.sin(currentAngle)
x2 = centerPointX+innerRadius*Math.cos(currentAngle)
y2 = centerPointY+innerRadius*Math.sin(currentAngle)
x3 = centerPointX+outerRadius*Math.cos(currentAngle2)
y3 = centerPointY+outerRadius*Math.sin(currentAngle2)
x4 = centerPointX+innerRadius*Math.cos(currentAngle2)
y4 = centerPointY+innerRadius*Math.sin(currentAngle2)
 How can I take the information I have and result in a path element with perfect circular curves?

@TITLE:How to use PTRACE to get a consistent view of multiple threads?
@CONTENT:While I was working on this question, I've come across a possible idea that uses ptrace, but I'm unable to get a proper understanding of how ptrace interacts with threads. Suppose I have a given, multithreaded main process, and I want to attach to a specific thread in it (perhaps from a forked child). Can I attach to a specific thread? (The manuals diverge on this question.) If so, does that mean that single-stepping only steps through that one thread's instructions? Does it stop all the process's threads? If so, do all the other threads remain stopped while I call PTRACE_SYSCALL or PTRACE_SINGLESTEP, or do all threads continue? Is there a way to step forward only in one single thread but guarantee that the other threads remain stopped? Basically, I want to synchronise the original program by forcing all threads to stop, and then only execute a small set of single-threaded instructions by single-stepping the one traced thread. My personal attempts so far look a bit like this: pid_t target = syscall(SYS_gettid);   // get the calling thread's ID
pid_t pid = fork();

if (pid > 0)
{
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);            // synchronise main process

    important_instruction();
}
else if (pid == 0)
{
    ptrace(target, PTRACE_ATTACH, NULL, NULL);    // does this work?

    // cancel parent's "waitpid" call, e.g. with a signal

    // single-step to execute "important_instruction()" above

   ptrace(target, PTRACE_DETACH, NULL, NULL);     // parent's threads resume?

   _Exit(0);
}
 However, I'm not sure, and can't find suitable references, that this is concurrently-correct and that important_instruction() is guaranteed to be executed only when all other threads are stopped. I also understand that there may be race conditions when the parent receives signals from elsewhere, and I heard that I should use PTRACE_SEIZE instead, but that doesn't seem to exist everywhere. Any clarification or references would be greatly appreciated!

Y=[1 0; 2 1]
w=[1 1 1]
Result = perceptron( X, Y, w )

 Thanks Thank you for the anwers, I got one more, If I change the Y = [0, 1], what happens to the algorithm?. So, Any input data will not work with Y = [0,1] with this code of the perceptron right?, -----------------------------EDIT------------------------ One more question, if I want to plot the line that divides the 2 classes, I know we can get that the line solving linear equation system that has to do with weights, but how, what could I do?, I'm trying something like % the initial weights
w_init = [ 1 1 1]';  
% the weights returned from perceptron    
wtag   = perceptron(X,Y,w_init,15);

 but this doesn't work if you have a image saved to disk with PIL as it gets compressed even if you turn the quality to 100 im1.save(outfile,quality=100). My code is currently following: http://pastebin.com/295kDMsp but the image always ends up re-saved.

@TITLE:How to get a Phone Number from an Address Book Contact (iphone sdk)
@CONTENT:I am showing an addressbook view to the user and letting them click on a contact and select a phone number. If they select a phone number, I want to get the phone number as an integer and the contact's name as an NSString. I've tried doing it with the following code:     //printf("%s\n",[[(NSArray *)ABMultiValueCopyArrayOfAllValues(theProperty) objectAtIndex:identifier] UTF8String]);

	//CFArrayRef *arrayString = [[(NSArray *)ABMultiValueCopyArrayOfAllValues(theProperty) objectAtIndex:identifier] UTF8String];
	NSArray *arrayString = [(NSArray *)ABMultiValueCopyArrayOfAllValues(theProperty) objectAtIndex:identifier];
	printf("%s\n", arrayString);
 This code is inside this method: - (BOOL)peoplePickerNavigationController:(ABPeoplePickerNavigationController *)peoplePicker shouldContinueAfterSelectingPerson:(ABRecordRef)person property:(ABPropertyID)property identifier:(ABMultiValueIdentifier)identifier
 And I am checking if the user selected a phone number with this code: if (propertyType == kABStringPropertyType)   
{
	[self wrongSelection];

} 
else if (propertyType == kABIntegerPropertyType)	 
{
	[self wrongSelection];

} 
else if (propertyType == kABRealPropertyType)	 
{
	[self wrongSelection];
} 
else if (propertyType == kABMultiStringPropertyType)     
{
     //This is the phone number...
 I am able to get the phone number to display in the console with printf, however I can't figure out how to convert it into an integer and how to also get the contacts name even though the property selected is not a person's name. Also, what I'm doing seems very inefficient. Are there any better ways to do this? Edit: If I can't store them as an int, a string would be fine. I just can't figure out how to go from that array to an actual string. If I cast it or save it as a UTF8String I always get some error.
@CODE://printf("%s\n",[[(NSArray *)ABMultiValueCopyArrayOfAllValues(theProperty) objectAtIndex:identifier] UTF8String]);

 But why does it even write private if that's implied and default? Just so that novice developers (who don't know it's the C# default) know that it's private?

I see this as almost an opposite to null coalescence, kind of mixed in with a terse, inline null-check, but I'm [almost] certain that there is no such operator in C#. Are there other languages that have such an operator? If so, what is it called? (I know that I can write a method for it in C#; I use return NullOrValue.of(x, () => x.y);, but if you have anything better, I'd like to see that too.)
@CODE:return x, unless it is null, in which case return y return null if x is null, otherwise return x.y return x == null ? null : x.y; null return x :: x.y; :: null return NullOrValue.of(x, () => x.y); return x ? x.y : NULL

@TITLE:Initialize a byte array to a certain value, other than the default null? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: What is the equivalent of memset in C#? 10 answers I'm sorry if this is a duplicate question, but I cannot find an answer to this on here or elsewhere on the web. I'm busy rewriting an old project that was done in C++, to C#. My task is to rewrite the program so that it functions as close to the original as possible. During a bunch of file-handling the previous developer who wrote this program creates a structure containing a ton of fields that correspond to the set format that a file has to be written in, so all that work is already done for me. These fields are all byte arrays. What the C++ code then does is use memset to set this entire structure to all spaces characters (0x20). One line of code. Easy. This is very important as the utility that this file eventually goes to is expecting the file in this format. What I've had to do is change this struct to a class in C#, but I cannot find a way to easily initialize each of these byte arrays to all space characters. What I've ended up having to do is this in the class constructor: //Initialize all of the variables to spaces.
int index = 0;
foreach (byte b in UserCode)
{
    UserCode[index] = 0x20;
    index++;
}
 This works fine, but I'm sure there must be a simpler way to do this. When the array is set to UserCode = new byte[6] in the constructor the byte array gets automatically initialized to the default null values. Is there no way that I can make it become all spaces upon declaration, so that when I call my class' constructor that it is initialized straight away like this? Or some memset-like function? Thank you in advance.
@CODE:memset 0x20 //Initialize all of the variables to spaces.
int index = 0;
foreach (byte b in UserCode)
{
    UserCode[index] = 0x20;
    index++;
} UserCode = new byte[6] memset

@CONTENT:I am trying to display milliseconds in an Excel macro. I have a column of integers which are simply timestamps in milliseconds (e.g. 28095200 is 7:48:15.200 am), and I want to make a new column next to it which keeps a running average and displays the time in a "hh:mm:ss.000" format. I have tried multiple different routes, but I simply can't get the milliseconds without causing weird things to happen. Here's what I have right now:  Dim Cel As Range
 Set Cel = Range("B1")
 temp = Application.Average(Range("A1:A2")) / 1000
 ms = Round(temp - Int(temp), 2) * 1000
 Cel.Value = Strings.Format((temp / 60 / 60 / 24), "hh:mm:ss") _
                & "." & Strings.Format(ms, "#000")
 For some reason, this only displays "mm:ss.0" in the cell. Yet when I click on the cell, it shows "hh:mm:ss" in the formula bar. Why are the hours missing in the cell? Also, another weird thing that happens is if I change the last line to Strings.Format(ms, "#000."), then I get "hh:mm:ss.000." That's what I want, just not the extra period.

@CONTENT:Acting on the answer to my Select a model property using a lambda and not a string property name question, wanting to add properties to a collection as follows: var props = new ExportPropertyInfoCollection<JobCard>();
props.Include(model => model.BusinessInstallNumber).Title("Install No").Width(64).KeepZeroPadding(true);
props.Include(model => model.DeviceName).Title("Device").Width(70);
props.Include(model => model.DateRequested).Title("Request Date").Format("{0:dd/MM/yyyy}").Width(83);
 I wrote the following code in the Include method: public class PropertyCollection<T>
{
    public void Include(Expression<Func<T, object>> expression)
    {
        var memberExpression = expression.Body as MemberExpression;
        if (memberExpression != null)

            Properties.Add(pes.Property.Property.Name, pes.Property);
            return pes;
    }
 However, on running the code, I found some of the lambdas yielded MemberExpression values as expected, but others yielded UnaryExpression values. I had to change the first line of code to the following before I could add all my properties using lambdas: var memberExpression = expression.Body as MemberExpression ?? ((UnaryExpression) expression.Body).Operand as MemberExpression;
 All the properties are 'simple' types, i.e. string, DateTime, int, bool, etc. in a POCO business object. They are decorated with several varying DataAnnotations attributes. What causes some of the lambdas in my example to yield MemberExpression values and others UnaryExpression values? In my example, the first UnaryExpression is on the third line, the DateTime property, but boolean properties also result in UnaryExpressions.

@CONTENT:On System.Windows.UIElement there is a CaptureMouse() and a paired ReleaseMouseCapture() method. In this WPF DragDrop sample they call CaptureMouse on MouseDown and release it on MouseUp. The documentation in MSDN is about as useless as it comes - "CaptureMouse -> Captures the mouse." In my head before trying it I assumed that it somehow locked the mouse inside the UIElement bounds, but that's clearly not the case when I try it. From experimenting, it seems to have something to do with responding to events when the mouse is outside of the UIElement, but not wanting to be a cargo cult programmer I don't want to just use it because the example does, I'd like an authoritative description of what it means.

@CONTENT:EDIT-2: None of the answers seem to work. Not even the one I previously marked as the answer of this question. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. First, I have googled for a how-to on creating a 'Go Back' link that allows the user to return to the previous page, and these are two ways of doing it: <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)">[Go Back]</a>
 and... <a href="#" onclick="history.go(-1);return false;">[Go Back]</a>
 Which of these two is a better choice? And why? (Also, please shed some light on browser compatibility.) That's one half of the question. Now if mine is the first page the user is visiting, the 'Go Back' link wouldn't work, right? (As there's no pre-existing history for the window or tab.) In that case, I want the link to fallback and take the user to http://example.com. i.e. if history exists, the user is taken to the previous page, and if it doesn't he's taken to http://example.com. How do I do that? Hope someone can help. EDIT: Please note that I do not know JavaScript, so kindly make your answer explanative. Thanks.

@TITLE:Why does C# execute Math.Sqrt() more slowly than VB.NET?
@CONTENT:Background While running benchmark tests this morning, my colleagues and I discovered some strange things concerning performance of C# code vs. VB.NET code. We started out comparing C# vs. Delphi Prism calculating prime numbers, and found that Prism was about 30% faster. I figured CodeGear optimized code more when generating IL (the exe was about twice as big as C#'s and had all sorts of different IL in it.) I decided to write a test in VB.NET as well, assuming that Microsoft's compilers would end up writing essentially the same IL for each language. However, the result there was more shocking: the code ran more than three times slower on C# than VB with the same operation! The generated IL was different, but not extremely so, and I'm not good enough at reading it to understand the differences. Benchmarks I've included the code for each below. On my machine, VB finds 348513 primes in about 6.36 seconds. C# finds the same number of primes in 21.76 seconds. Computer Specs and Notes Intel Core 2 Quad 6600 @ 2.4Ghz Every machine I've tested on there is a noticeable difference in the benchmark results between C# and VB.NET. Both of the console applications were compiled in Release mode, but otherwise no project settings were changed from the defaults generated by Visual Studio 2008.

@TITLE:Why should I capitalize my SQL keywords? [duplicate]
@CONTENT:Possible Duplicate: Is there a good reason to use upper case for T-SQL keywords? Simple question. I personally find a string of lowercase characters to be more readable than a string of uppercase characters. Is some old/popular flavor of SQL case-sensitive or something? For reference: select
    this.Column1,
    case when this.Column2 is null then 0 else this.Column2 end
from dbo.SomeTable this
    inner join dbo.AnotherTable another on this.id = another.id
where
    this.Price > 100
 vs. SELECT
    this.Column1,
    CASE WHEN this.Column2 IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE this.Column2 END
FROM dbo.SomeTable this
    INNER JOIN dbo.AnotherTable another ON this.id = another.id
WHERE
    this.Price > 100
 The former just seems so much more readable to me, but I see the latter way more often.
@CODE:select
    this.Column1,
    case when this.Column2 is null then 0 else this.Column2 end
from dbo.SomeTable this

@TITLE:How should you diagnose the error SEHException - External component has thrown an exception
@CONTENT:Whenever a user reports an error such as System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException - External component has thrown an exception? is there anything that I as a programmer can do to determine the cause? Scenario : One user (using a program my company wrote) has reported this error. This may or may not have been a one off error. They mentioned that in the last month, the computer has twice 'stopped working'. I have learnt from experience, not to take this description too literally, as it usually means that someone relating to the computer is not working as expected. They were unable to give me more details and I could not find any logged errors. Hence it may or may not have been this error. From the stack-trace, the actual error was when constructing a class which does not directly call any interop code, but perhaps complicated by the fact that the object may be part of a list that is databound to a DevExpress Grid. The error was 'caught' by an unhandled exception routine which normally will close down the program, but has an option to ignore and continue. If they opted to ignore the error, then the program continued working but the error re-occurred when this routine was next run. However it did not occur again after closing and restarting our application. The computer in question did not seem to be stressed out. It is running Vista Business, has 2GB of memory and according to Task Manager was only using about half of that with our application just about 200Mb. There is one other piece of information that may or may not be relevant. Another section of the same program uses a third party component which is effectively a dotnet wrapper around a native dll and this component does have a known issue where very occasionally, you get a Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt The component makers say that this has been fixed in the latest version of their component which we are using in-house, but this has not been given to the customer yet. Given that the consequences of the error are low (no work is lost and restarting the program and getting back to where they were only takes a minute at most) and given that the customer will shortly be getting a new version (with the updated third-party component), I can obviously cross my fingers and hope the error won't occur again. But is there anything more I can do?

Is there any way to get Chrome to respond to these key presses?

@CODE:skel userid = 0 skel.sql INSERT INTO `{{TABLE_PREFIX}}users` VALUES (0, '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, '', '', '', NULL); uid auto_increment 0 INSERT UPDATE 0

self.message_user(request, mark_safe("<a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Here's google!</a>"))

@TITLE:How to dynamically add a style for text-align using jQuery
@CONTENT:I'm trying to correct the usual IE bugs around CSS 2.1 and need a way to alter an elements style properties to add a custom text-align style. Currently in jQuery you can do something like $(this).width( or $(this).height(
 but I can't seem to find a good way to alter the text-align w/ this same approach. The item already has a class and I do set the text-align in that class with no luck. Is it possible to just add a text-align css attribute to this element after a class is defined? I have something like this $(this).css("text-align", "center");
 just after my width adjustment and after I view this in firebug I see only "width" is the only property set on the style ... any help? EDIT: Whoa - big response on this question! Thanks to everyone who replied! A bit more detail around the problem at hand: I'm tweaking the js source for jqGrid A3.5 to do some custom sub grid work and the actual JS i'm tweaking is shown below (sorry for using "this" in my examples above, but I wanted to keep this simple for brevity) var subGridJson = function(sjxml, sbid) {
                    var tbl, trdiv, tddiv, result = "", i, cur, sgmap,
    		        dummy = document.createElement("table");
                    tbl = document.createElement("tbody");
                    $(dummy).attr({ cellSpacing: "0", cellPadding: "0", border: "0" });
                    trdiv = document.createElement("tr");
                    for (i = 0; i < ts.p.subGridModel[0].name.length; i++) {
                        tddiv = document.createElement("th");
                        tddiv.className = "ui-state-default ui-th-column";
                        $(tddiv).html(ts.p.subGridModel[0].name[i]);
                        $(tddiv).width(ts.p.subGridModel[0].width[i]);

                        trdiv.appendChild(tddiv);
                    }
                    tbl.appendChild(trdiv);
 I've tried both of the below (from the answers provided) with no luck. $(tddiv).width(ts.p.subGridModel[0].width[i]).attr('style', 'text-align: center');
 AND $(tddiv).width(ts.p.subGridModel[0].width[i]).css('text-align', 'center');
 I will continue to work on this issue today and post a final solution for anyone feeling my pain around this strange issue.
@CODE:$(this).width( or $(this).height( $(this).css("text-align", "center"); var subGridJson = function(sjxml, sbid) {

 As far as I know, this public key is a constant string, which is given from Google during application upload process. How can we create the same key programmatically using any bit manipulation process? Has someone done it before? Is there any sample code on how to do this?

@CONTENT:Is it possible to configure different log levels for a single Logger based on the appender? I realize this is similar to this question, and this is as far as I had already got myself, but the problem with this is that the threshold applies to all loggers that log to that appender, whereas I only want the threshold to apply to a single logger. i.e. So far I have something like this: log4j.rootLogger=WARN, stdout

@TITLE:How to mount host volumes into docker containers in Dockerfile during build
@CONTENT:Original question: How to use the VOLUME instruction in Dockerfile? Revised: update from the answer below, so the actual question I want to solve is -- how to mount host volumes into docker containers in Dockerfile during build, i.e., having the docker run -v /export:/export capability during docker build. Update: So the answer is "Not possible". I can accept it as an answer as I know the issue has been extensively discussed at https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3156. I can understand that portability is a paramount issue for docker developer; but as a docker user, I have to say I'm very disappointed about this missing feature. Let me close my argument with a quote from aforementioned discussion: "I would like to use Gentoo as a base image but definitely don't want > 1GB of Portage tree data to be in any of the layers once the image has been built. You could have some nice a compact containers if it wasn't for the gigantic portage tree having to appear in the image during the install." Yes, I can use wget or curl to download whatever I need, but the fact that merely a portability consideration is now forcing me to download > 1GB of Portage tree each time I build a Gentoo base image is neither efficient nor user friendly. Further more, the package repository WILL ALWAYS be under /usr/portage, thus ALWAYS PORTABLE under Gentoo. Again, I respect the decision, but please allow me expressing my disappointment as well in the mean time. Thanks. Original question in details: From Share Directories via Volumes http://docker.readthedocs.org/en/v0.7.3/use/working_with_volumes/ it says that Data volumes feature "have been available since version 1 of the Docker Remote API". My docker is of version 1.2.0, but I found the example given in above article not working: # BUILD-USING: ???????docker build -t data .

@TITLE:Apache POI Excel - how to configure columns to be expanded?
@CONTENT:I am using Apache POI API to generate excel spreadsheet to output some data. The problem I am facing is when the spreadsheet is created and opened, columns are not expanded so that some long text like Date formatted text is not showing up on first glance. I could just double click the column border in excel to expand or drag the border to adjust the column width but there could be 20+ columns and there is no way I want to do that manually every time I open the spreadsheet :( I found out (though could be wrong method) groupRow() and setColumnGroupCollapsed() might be able to do the trick but no luck. Maybe I'm using it in wrong way. Sample Code snippet         Workbook wb = new HSSFWorkbook();
        CreationHelper createHelper = wb.getCreationHelper();
        //create sheet
        Sheet sheet = wb.createSheet("masatoSheet");

        //not really working yet.... :(
        //set group for expand/collapse
        //sheet.groupRow(0, 10); //just random fromRow toRow argument values...
        //sheet.setColumnGroupCollapsed(0, true);

        //create row
        Row row = sheet.createRow((short)0);
        //put a cell in the row and store long text data
        row.createCell(0).setCellValue("Loooooooong text not to show up first");
 When this spreadsheet is created, the "Looooooong text not to show up first" string is in the cell but since the column is not expanded only "Loooooooo" is showing up. How can I configure it so that when I open my spreadsheet, the column is already expanded???

@CONTENT:In the documentation on AsyncTask it gives the following as a rule related to threading: The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if a second execution is attempted.) All this means is that you have to create a new instance of the class every time you want to use it, right? In other words, it must be done like this: new DownloadFilesTask().execute(url1, url2, url3);
new DownloadFilesTask().execute(url4, url5, url6);
 Or conversely, you can NOT do the following: DownloadFilesTask dfTask = new DownloadFilesTask();
dfTask.execute(url1, url2, url3);
dfTask.execute(url4, url5, url6);
 Can someone verify this is an accurate interpretation? I realize I pretty much just answered this for myself as I was typing this out... But it wasn't immediately obvious to me so I think this would be useful to have posted nonetheless.

However none of the menu callbacks (onCreateOptionsMenu, onPrepareOptionsMenu and onOptionsItemSelected) are being called (I've debugged with some breakpoints in those methods) and the menu isn't shown. Am I missing something? Do I need to add something in my Activity? I'm using the Android Compatibility Library, compiling with L11 SDK and testing in a Xoom. EDIT: I've found the problem. My AndroidManifest is targeting L11, this seems to hide the menu button and prevent from the callbacks being called. However if I remove this from the manifest I loose some other features I need (for example the activated state in lists). Does anyone know how to solve this issue (enable the menu button) without removing the targetSdkVersion=11 from the Manifest?

@CONTENT:To use different Entity Manager / Connection based on URL in Symfony if fairly easy. With the following routing configuration connection:
    pattern:  /a/{connection}
    defaults: { _controller: AcmeTestBundle:User:index }
 and from the following Cookbook; How to work with Multiple Entity Managers and Connections My controller would look something like this; class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function indexAction($connection)
    {

        $products = $this->get('doctrine')
            ->getRepository('AcmeStoreBundle:Product', $connection)
            ->findAll()
        ;
        ..................
 and I'll be able to fetch product information from different em/connection/database. Now, if I add something like this to my routing; login:
    pattern:  /a/{connection}/login
    defaults: { _controller: FOSUserBundle:Security:login }
 How can I easily make the login to use connection as defined in the connection variable? This setup assume each database has their own user login information (the fos_user table). Edit: Updated routing information Edit2: I'm still new with PHP/Symfony/Doctrine though, so please forgive me if I'm completely wrong here. I tried to manually set the connection at FOS\UserBundle\Doctrine\UserManager. The following is the constructor of the class //
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
//

public function __construct(EncoderFactoryInterface $encoderFactory, CanonicalizerInterface $usernameCanonicalizer, CanonicalizerInterface $emailCanonicalizer, ObjectManager $om, $class)
{
    parent::__construct($encoderFactory, $usernameCanonicalizer, $emailCanonicalizer);

    $this->objectManager = $om;
    $this->repository = $om->getRepository($class);

    $metadata = $om->getClassMetadata($class);
    $this->class = $metadata->getName();
}
 In a controller, we can use the following method to change the em to 'testing' $em = $this->get('doctrine')->getManager('testing');
$repository = $this->get('doctrine')->getRepository($class, 'testing')
 For that I changed the code to the following to use EntityManager instead of ObjectManager. //
//use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager;
//

public function __construct(EncoderFactoryInterface $encoderFactory, CanonicalizerInterface $usernameCanonicalizer, CanonicalizerInterface $emailCanonicalizer, EntityManager $om, $class)
{
    parent::__construct($encoderFactory, $usernameCanonicalizer, $emailCanonicalizer);

    $this->objectManager = $om;
    $this->repository = $om->getRepository($class);

    $metadata = $om->getClassMetadata($class);
    $this->class = $metadata->getName();
}
 My app works fine with no error. From the way it works with the controller, I tried changing the connection by adding a parameter to this line then, but it's still using the default connection. $this->repository = $om->getRepository($class, 'testing');
 What else could I be missing here?
@CODE:connection:
    pattern:  /a/{connection}

@TITLE:Serializing object with no namespaces using DataContractSerializer
@CONTENT:How do I remove XML namespaces from an object's XML representation serialized using DataContractSerializer? That object needs to be serialized to a very simple output XML. Latest & greatest - using .Net 4 beta 2 The object will never need to be deserialized. XML should not have any xmlns:... namespace refs Any subtypes of Exception and ISubObject need to be supported. It will be very difficult to change the original object. Object:  [Serializable] 
 class MyObj
 {
     string str;
     Exception ex;
     ISubObject subobj;
 }
 Need to serialize into: <xml>
  <str>...</str>
  <ex i:nil="true" />
  <subobj i:type="Abc">
     <AbcProp1>...</AbcProp1>
     <AbcProp2>...</AbcProp2>
  </subobj>
</xml>
 I used this code: private static string ObjectToXmlString(object obj)
{
    if (obj == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("obj");

    var serializer =
        new DataContractSerializer(
            obj.GetType(), null, Int32.MaxValue, false, false, null,
            new AllowAllContractResolver());

    var sb = new StringBuilder();
    using (var xw = XmlWriter.Create(sb, new XmlWriterSettings
    {
        OmitXmlDeclaration = true,
        NamespaceHandling = NamespaceHandling.OmitDuplicates,
        Indent = true
    }))
    {
        serializer.WriteObject(xw, obj);
        xw.Flush();

        return sb.ToString();
    }
}
 From this article I adopted a DataContractResolver so that no subtypes have to be declared: public class AllowAllContractResolver : DataContractResolver
{
    public override bool TryResolveType(Type dataContractType, Type declaredType, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver, out XmlDictionaryString typeName, out XmlDictionaryString typeNamespace)
    {
        if (!knownTypeResolver.TryResolveType(dataContractType, declaredType, null, out typeName, out typeNamespace))
        {
            var dictionary = new XmlDictionary();
            typeName = dictionary.Add(dataContractType.FullName);
            typeNamespace = dictionary.Add(dataContractType.Assembly.FullName);
        }
        return true;
    }

    public override Type ResolveName(string typeName, string typeNamespace, Type declaredType, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver)
    {
        return knownTypeResolver.ResolveName(typeName, typeNamespace, declaredType, null) ?? Type.GetType(typeName + ", " + typeNamespace);
    }
}

    {
        serializer.WriteObject(xw, obj);
        xw.Flush();

        return sb.ToString();
    }
} public class AllowAllContractResolver : DataContractResolver

        }
        return true;
    }

    public override Type ResolveName(string typeName, string typeNamespace, Type declaredType, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver)
    {
        return knownTypeResolver.ResolveName(typeName, typeNamespace, declaredType, null) ?? Type.GetType(typeName + ", " + typeNamespace);

@TITLE:Storyboard Segue From View Controller to Itself
@CONTENT:I am trying to make a mechanism to drill down a file / folder list. The idea is to show the same file list view controller every time the user selects a folder, and show a file detail view controller if he/she selects a file. So far I have created a segue from the file list view controller to the file detail view controller, and a segue from the file list table view cell to the the file list table view controller: The issue with this is that as soon as the user taps the cell, the segue is executed. I would like to remove the segue from the table view cell and make one from the file list view controller to itself. That way, I could trigger the right segue programmatically when user tapped the cell. So, my question is: Is is possible to create a segue from a view controller to itself in Interface Builder?

@CONTENT:I'm looking to style a modal dialog (using UI Dialog) with unique CSS that is separate from the traditional dialog, so in essence to have two jQuery dialogs that each look different. I've styled one, for example, <div id="dialog_style1" class="dialog1 hidden">One content</div>
 and another <div id="dialog_style2" class="dialog2 hidden">Another content</div>
 Unfortunately I've noticed that using separate CSS to style parts of the dialog box, like .dialog1 .ui-dialog-titlebar { display:none; }
.dialog2 .ui-dialog-titlebar { color:#aaa; }
 doesn't work because .ui-dialog-titlebar does not have the class .dialog1, and I can't do an addClass either without breaking into the plugin. An alternative would be to have an element like body have a unique class/id (depending on which one I want), but that would preclude having both dialogs in the same page. How can I do this?

If PIDs are allocated sequentially how does Linux fill in the gaps? What happens when it hits the end? For example if I run a PHP script from Apache that does a <?php print(getmypid());?> the same PID will be printed out for a few minutes while hit refresh. This period of time is a function of how many requests apache is receiving. Even if there is only one client the PID will eventually change. When the PID changes, it will be a close number, but how close? The number does not appear to be entirely sequential. If I do a ps aux | grep apache I get a fair number of processes: How does Linux choose this next number? The previous few PID's are still running, as well as the most recent PID that was printed. How does apache choose to reuse these PIDs?

@TITLE:Stop Visual Basic 6 from changing my casing
@CONTENT:Very simple question that is apparently impossible to find a decent answer to: How can I make Visual Basic 6 stop changing my ^@#*ing variable casing!?! I know that the general opinion of a great many VB users is that this "feature" is actually quite helpful, but I doubt that they use it much with any source control system. This is absolutely INFURIATING when you are trying to collaborate on a project of any significant size with several other developers. If ignored, you produce thousands of false-positive "changes" to your files (even ones with no actual code changes!) that pollute the revision history and make it near impossible in some cases to locate the actual change that took place. If you don't ignore it (like my office, where we have been forced to implement a "no unneeded case change" policy), you spend 5x the time you would normally on each commit because you have to carefully revert out VB's "corrections" on every file, sometimes reverting hundreds of lines to put in a one line change. Surely there must be a setting, plugin, hack, etc. out there that can remove this unwanted "feature"? I am willing to take any method I can get as long as it doesn't require me to pick through piles of phantom diffs. And to squash a couple of complaints up front: No, I can't turn off case detection in my diff tool, that's not the point. No, we can't just make the case changes globally. We're working with hundreds of thousands of LOC being worked on by multiple developers spanning many years of development. Synchronizing that is not feasible from a business standpoint. And, finally: No, we cannot upgrade to VB.net or port to another language (as much as I would love to). (And yes, I am just a tiny bit peeved at the moment. Can you tell? My apologies, but this is costing me time and my company money, and I don't find that acceptable.)

@TITLE:WPF MVVM ComboBox SelectedItem or SelectedValue not working
@CONTENT:Update After a bit of investigating. What seems to be the issue is that the SelectedValue/SelectedItem is occurring before the Item source is finished loading. If I sit in a break point and wait a few seconds it works as expected. Don't know how I'm going to get around this one. End Update I have an application using in WPF using MVVM with a ComboBox. Below is the ViewModel Example. The issue I'm having is when we leave our page and migrate back the ComboBox is not selecting the current Value that is selected. View Model public class MyViewModel
{
     private MyObject _selectedObject;
     private Collection<Object2> _objects;
     private IModel _model;

     public MyViewModel(IModel model)
    {
         _model = model;
         _objects = _model.GetObjects();
    }

    public Collection<MyObject> Objects
    {
         get
         {
              return _objects;
         }
         private set
         {
              _objects = value;
         }
     }

     public MyObject SelectedObject
     {
          get
          {
              return _selectedObject;
          }
          set
          {
               _selectedObject = value;
          }
      }
 }
 For the sake of this example lets say MyObject has two properties (Text and Id). My XAML for the ComboBox looks like this. XAML <ComboBox Name="MyComboBox" Height="23"  Width="auto" 
    SelectedItem="{Binding Path=SelectedObject,Mode=TwoWay}" 
    ItemsSource="{Binding Objects}"
    DisplayMemberPath="Text"
    SelectedValuePath="Id">
 No matter which way I configure this when I come back to the page and the object is reassembled the ComboBox will not select the value. The object is returning the correct object via the get in the property though. I'm not sure if this is just an issue with the way the ComboBox and MVVM pattern works. The text box binding we are doing works correctly.
@CODE:public class MyViewModel
{
     private MyObject _selectedObject;
     private Collection<Object2> _objects;
     private IModel _model;

     public MyViewModel(IModel model)
    {
         _model = model;
         _objects = _model.GetObjects();
    }

    public Collection<MyObject> Objects
    {
         get
         {
              return _objects;
         }
         private set
         {
              _objects = value;
         }
     }

     public MyObject SelectedObject
     {
          get
          {
              return _selectedObject;
          }
          set
          {
               _selectedObject = value;
          }
      }
 } <ComboBox Name="MyComboBox" Height="23"  Width="auto" 
    SelectedItem="{Binding Path=SelectedObject,Mode=TwoWay}"

@TITLE:How to properly and completely close/reset a TcpClient connection?
@CONTENT:What is the correct way to close or reset a TcpClient connection? We have software that communicates with hardware but sometimes something goes wrong and we are no longer to communicate with it, until we restart the software. I have tried forcing TcpClient.Close() and even setting it to null but that doesn't work. Only a complete restart of the software works. Suggestions? I can't use the using keyword because TpcClient is only defined in one location, but used throughout the library. (And there is only one connection at any given time) It's a library that handles communication. The software itself can call the ResetConnection() method of the Controller class (which represents the hardware). It currently looks like if (tcpClient != null)
{
    tcpClient.Close();
    tcpClient = null;
}
 Now from what I've read here I should use tcpClient.Dispose() instead of " = null" I'll give that a try and see if it makes a difference.

@LINK:/questions/23871757/the-stdtransform-like-function-that-returns-transformed-container
@TITLE:The std::transform-like function that returns transformed container
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement a function similar to std::transform algorithm but instead of taking the output iterator by an argument I want to create and return a container with transformed input elements. Let's say that it's named transform_container and takes two arguments: container and functor. It should return the same container type but possibly parametrized by a different element type (the Functor can return element of different type). I'd like to use my function as in the example below: std::vector<int> vi{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
auto vs = transform_container(vi, [] (int i) { return std::to_string(i); }); 
//vs will be std::vector<std::string>
assert(vs == std::vector<std::string>({"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"}));

std::set<int> si{ 5, 10, 15 };
auto sd = transform_container(si, [] (int i) { return i / 2.; }); 
//sd will be of type std::set<double>
assert(sd == std::set<double>({5/2., 10/2., 15/2.}));
 I was able two write two functions X one for std::set and one for std::vector X that seem to work properly. They are identical, except of the container typename. Their code is listed below. template<typename T, typename Functor>
auto transform_container(const std::vector<T> &v, Functor &&f) -> std::vector<decltype(f(*v.begin()))>
{
    std::vector<decltype(f(*v.begin()))> ret;
    std::transform(std::begin(v), std::end(v), std::inserter(ret, ret.end()), f);
    return ret;
}

template<typename T, typename Functor>
auto transform_container(const std::set<T> &v, Functor &&f) -> std::set<decltype(f(*v.begin()))>
{
    std::set<decltype(f(*v.begin()))> ret;
    std::transform(std::begin(v), std::end(v), std::inserter(ret, ret.end()), f);
    return ret;
}
 However, when I attempted to merge them into a single general function that works with any container, I encountered numerous issues. The set and vector are class templates, so my function template must take a template template parameter. Moreover, set and vector templates have a different number of type parameters that needs to be properly adjusted. What is the best way to generalize the two function templates above into a function that works with any compatible container type?
@CODE:std::transform transform_container std::vector<int> vi{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
auto vs = transform_container(vi, [] (int i) { return std::to_string(i); }); 
//vs will be std::vector<std::string>
assert(vs == std::vector<std::string>({"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"}));

std::set<int> si{ 5, 10, 15 };
auto sd = transform_container(si, [] (int i) { return i / 2.; }); 
//sd will be of type std::set<double>
assert(sd == std::set<double>({5/2., 10/2., 15/2.})); std::set std::vector template<typename T, typename Functor>
auto transform_container(const std::vector<T> &v, Functor &&f) -> std::vector<decltype(f(*v.begin()))>
{
    std::vector<decltype(f(*v.begin()))> ret;
    std::transform(std::begin(v), std::end(v), std::inserter(ret, ret.end()), f);
    return ret;
}

template<typename T, typename Functor>
auto transform_container(const std::set<T> &v, Functor &&f) -> std::set<decltype(f(*v.begin()))>
{
    std::set<decltype(f(*v.begin()))> ret;
    std::transform(std::begin(v), std::end(v), std::inserter(ret, ret.end()), f);
    return ret;

@TITLE:Triple inheritance causes metaclass conflictK Sometimes
@CONTENT:Looks like I stumbled upon a metaclass hell even when I didn't wanted anything to do with it. I'm writing an app in Qt4 using PySide. I want to separate event-driven part from UI definition, which is generated from Qt Designer files. Hence I create a "controller" classes, but to ease my life I multiple-inherit them anyways. An example: class BaseController(QObject):
    def setupEvents(self, parent):
        self.window = parent

class MainController(BaseController):
    pass

class MainWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow, MainController):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super(MainWindow, self).__init__(parent)

        self.setupUi(self)
        self.setupEvents(self)
 This works as expected. It also has inheritance from (QDialog, Ui_Dialog, BaseController). But when I subclass BaseController and try to inherit from said subclass (in place of BaseController), I receive an error: TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases Clarification: Both QMainWindow and QDialog inherit from QObject. BaseController must also inherit from it because of Qt event system peculiarities. Ui_ classes only inherit from simple Python object class. I searched for solutions, but all of them involve cases of intentionally using metaclasses. So I must be doing something terribly wrong. EDIT: My description may be clearer by adding graphs. Working example: QObject

@TITLE:'method' vs. 'message' vs. 'function' vs. '???'
@CONTENT:I recently asked a question about what I called "method calls". The answer referred to "messages". As a self-taught hobby programmer trying to phrase questions that don't make me look like an idiot, I'm realizing that the terminology that I use reveals a lot about how I learned to program. Is there a distinction between the various terms for methods/messages/etc. in OO programming? Is this a difference that comes from different programming languages using different terminology to describe similar concepts? I seem to remember that in pre-OO languages, a distinction would sometimes be made between "subroutines" and "functions" based on whether a return value was expected, but even then, was this a language-by-language distinction?

@TITLE:How can I use BitmapRegionDecoder code in android 2.2.2 (Froyo)?
@CONTENT:I was reading an answer to a different question on SO, in which @RomainGuy commented that one could (please correct me if I'm paraphrasing incorrectly) back-port code from later versions of android to earlier versions. Specifically, I am interested in back-porting code for BitmapRegionDecoder from Android version 2.3.3 (Gingerbread) to version 2.2.2 (Froyo). I would have rather asked the question more generally as what is the best practice / what should be avoided when back-porting code from newer versions of Android to older versions, but stackoverflow hinted that my question might be closed as being too subjective. Maybe if there is enough interest in the topic, this question could be "morphed" into a more general one..possibly a community wiki? In any case, I would appreciate any insight into how this is done..whether specific to my use case, or more general advice. Do calls to native methods from within the java class complicate the matter (necessarily involving the NDK)? If it is indeed possible (and reasonable) to cherry-pick and back-port code in this way, I think many would find it very useful to know how.

 JPA @Entity and @Column annotations are used in domain objects, and the problematic fields look like this: @Column(name = "Checked")
private boolean checked;
 HSQL schema: Checked bit default 0 not null,
 MySQL schema: `Checked` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0',
 What is the most straightforward way to solve this while sticking with Hibernate 4? Should I change the database schema, Hibernate configs, or domain class annotations? I have no idea if the code and configuration was fully "correct" before, but at least it worked fine with Hibernate 3.

@TITLE:Why do case class companion objects extend FunctionN?
@CONTENT:When you create a case class, the compiler creates a corresponding companion object with a few of the case class goodies: an apply factory method matching the primary constructor, equals, hashCode, and copy. Somewhat oddly, this generated object extends FunctionN. scala> case class A(a: Int)                                 
defined class A

scala> A: (Int => A)
res0: (Int) => A = <function1>
 This is only the case if: There is no manually defined companion object There is exactly one parameter list There are no type arguments The case class isn't abstract. Seems like this was added about two years ago. The latest incarnation is here. Does anyone use this, or know why it was added? It increases the size of the generated bytecode a little with static forwarder methods, and shows up in the #toString() method of the companion objects: scala> case class A()
defined class A

scala> A.toString
res12: java.lang.String = <function0>
 UPDATE Manually created objects with a single apply method are not automatically considered as FunctionN: object HasApply {
  def apply(a: Int) = 1
}
val i = HasApply(1)

// fails
//  HasApply: (Int => Int)
@CODE:apply equals hashCode copy scala> case class A(a: Int)

res0: (Int) => A = <function1> #toString() scala> case class A()

@CONTENT:I have a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) class that I want to unit test. There are two approaches: write a test case that takes a large amount of samples and test whether they are properly distributed. This approach may lead to a fairly long execution time for the test case; calculate a small series of samples 'by hand' and verify if the PRNG algorithm reproduces it. This approach may lead to a not random sequence being generated without being noticed; I would say that the first approach is not really unit testing because it does not perform a white box test of the generator, but on the other hand it properly tests the responsibility of the class. The second approach is more like a real unit test, focusing on the algorithm, but it does not provide as much evidence as to whether the class fulfills its responsibility. Which approach do you prefer, and why?

@LINK:/questions/15093916/angularjs-watch-on-location-search-doesnt-work-when-reloadonsearch-is-false
@TITLE:AngularJs $watch on $location.search doesn't work when reloadOnSearch is false
@CONTENT:My routeProvider for route has reloadOnSearch set to false :  $routeProvider
     .when(
        "/film/list",
         {
          templateUrl: '/film/list.html', 
          controller: FilmListController,
          reloadOnSearch: false
          } 
          ....

  )
 I did this because I don't want the whole controller to be reloaded after query string changes, but I still use it and the url looks like this: film/list?sort=isbn&order=asc&offset=0. Now whenever query string changes I want to call a function from my controller. So I tried to set up a $watch in the controller: $scope.location = $location;
$scope.$watch( 'location.search()', function( search) {
        $scope.list();
 });
 But this doesn't work. If I set $watch to watch changes of an individual parameter of a query string, then it works. But I don't want to set $watch for every parameter of my query string. The solution I use now is this: $scope.location = $location;
$scope.$watch( 'location.url()', function( url ) {
    if($location.path() == '/film/list')
        $scope.list();
 });
 So instead of watching for the search, I watch the whole url, and then I check if the path is the one I set in routeProvider to conditionally call the function. What I don't like about this solution is that I have to explicilty type the value for $location.path to be matched. Can anyone suggest a better solution, and perhaps explain me why is $watch not working for $location.search() ?
@CODE:$routeProvider
     .when(
        "/film/list",
         {
          templateUrl: '/film/list.html', 
          controller: FilmListController,
          reloadOnSearch: false
          } 
          ....

  ) film/list?sort=isbn&order=asc&offset=0 $scope.location = $location;
$scope.$watch( 'location.search()', function( search) {
        $scope.list();
 }); $scope.location = $location;
$scope.$watch( 'location.url()', function( url ) {
    if($location.path() == '/film/list')
        $scope.list();
 });

@LINK:/questions/14010551/how-to-convert-between-bytes-and-strings-in-python-3
@TITLE:How to convert between bytes and strings in Python 3?
@CONTENT:This is a Python 101 type question, but it had me baffled for a while when I tried to use a package that seemed to convert my string input into bytes. As you will see below I found the answer for myself, but I felt it was worth recording here because of the time it took me to unearth what was going on. It seems to be generic to Python 3, so I have not referred to the original package I was playing with; it does not seem to be an error (just that the particular package had a .tostring() method that was clearly not producing what I understood as a string...) My test program goes like this: import mangler                                 # spoof package

stringThing = """
<Doc>
    <Greeting>Hello World</Greeting>
    <Greeting>An</Greeting>
</Doc>
"""

# print out the input
print('This is the string input:')
print(stringThing)

# now make the string into bytes
bytesThing = mangler.tostring(stringThing)    # pseudo-code again

# now print it out
print('\nThis is the bytes output:')
print(bytesThing)
 The output from this code gives this: This is the string input:

<Doc>
    <Greeting>Hello World</Greeting>
    <Greeting>An</Greeting>
</Doc>


This is the bytes output:
b'\n<Doc>\n    <Greeting>Hello World</Greeting>\n    <Greeting>\xe4\xbd\xa0\xe5\xa5\xbd</Greeting>\n</Doc>\n'
 So, there is a need to be able to convert between bytes and strings, to avoid ending up with non-ascii characters being turned into gobbledegook.
@CODE:.tostring() import mangler                                 # spoof package

stringThing = """
<Doc>
    <Greeting>Hello World</Greeting>
    <Greeting>An</Greeting>
</Doc>
"""

# print out the input
print('This is the string input:')
print(stringThing)

# now make the string into bytes
bytesThing = mangler.tostring(stringThing)    # pseudo-code again

# now print it out
print('\nThis is the bytes output:')
print(bytesThing) This is the string input:

<Doc>
    <Greeting>Hello World</Greeting>
    <Greeting>An</Greeting>
</Doc>


This is the bytes output:
b'\n<Doc>\n    <Greeting>Hello World</Greeting>\n    <Greeting>\xe4\xbd\xa0\xe5\xa5\xbd</Greeting>\n</Doc>\n'

 I don't get any other debug information if I execute the jar. Is there any option to validate the jarfile? Or having something like java -verbose...? Steps to reproduce: create a new folder Copy the Pom.xml from above into the folder. Save the small `public static void main(...). into src/main/java/com/mycompany/test/Start.java execute mvn clean package execute java -jar target/com.mycompany.test-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Attachment 1: package com.mycompany.test;


public class Start
{
    public static void main(final String[] args) 
    {
        System.out.println("If you are able to get this printed with java -jar you made it. Thanks a lot! :)");
    }
}
 Edit 1: I started to delete some dependencies to identify the problem. But I haven't got a clear understanding what goes wrong. Now I figured out (See hint B in the pom.xml) that moving the Apache POI dependencies to the top will solve the problem. But still I don't know how to why and what is the problem.
@CODE:java -jar target/com.company.product-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile target/com. company.product-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar pom.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@CONTENT:So I have a brand new app I created last night for iOS6, using XCode 4.5. I can properly develop on my iPhone 4 with iOS6. Today I got my new iPhone 5 with iOS6 and, after updating the certificates with the new device UUID, I tried to run my app on it and got this error: XCode cannot run using the selected device. Choose a destination with a supported architecture in order to run on this device. I've enabled the device for development. Both armv7 and armv7s are on the settings. I have included the sources from the Facebook 3.0 SDK and the linker flag '-lsqlite3.0'. I'm guessing the issue has to be related, but cannot figure what is wrong. Any ideas how to solve it? PS: The issue happens too when running the app on the simulator. No idea what changed on my project or XCode between last night and today, other than I have a new device and new certificates. The selected destination does not support the architecture for which the selected software is built. Switch to a destination that supports that architecture in order to run the selected software.

@TITLE:AlertDialog: How To Remove Black Borders Above and Below View
@CONTENT:This question has been asked before: AlertDialog custom title has black border But was not answered satisfactorily - and is missing some information. I'm trying to create a custom dialog in Android without a title and without any buttons along the bottom. However, the resulting dialog has black "borders"/"spacing"/something along the top and bottom of the view. From the Documentation: A dialog made with the base Dialog class must have a title. If you don't call setTitle(), then the space used for the title remains empty, but still visible. If you don't want a title at all, then you should create your custom dialog using the AlertDialog class. However, because an AlertDialog is created easiest with the AlertDialog.Builder class, you do not have access to the setContentView(int) method used above. Instead, you must use setView(View). This method accepts a View object, so you need to inflate the layout's root View object from XML. So, that's what I did: Welcome.java public class Welcome  extends Activity
{
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        setContentView(R.layout.welcome);

        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater)this.getSystemService(LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        View layout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.welcomedialog, (ViewGroup)findViewById(R.id.layout_root));

        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
        builder.setView(layout);
        builder.create().show();
    }
}
 welcomedialog.xml <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:layout_width="fill_parent"
              android:layout_height="fill_parent"
              android:background="@drawable/texturebg"

 NOTE: I've tried using FrameLayout as the root ViewGroup instead of LinearLayout as per a suggestion I found somewhere - but that didn't help. Result setBackgroundDrawable Suggestion public class Welcome  extends Activity
{
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
    {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        setContentView(R.layout.welcome);

        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater)this.getSystemService(LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
        View layout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.welcomedialog, (ViewGroup)findViewById(R.id.layout_root));

@LINK:/questions/5972546/is-stdstring-part-of-the-stl
@TITLE:Is std::string part of the STL?
@CONTENT:(When I say STL, I'm talking about the template library that revolves around containers, iterators, algorithms and functors.) This question came to mind after thinking that a std::string mostly behaves like a normal container, with begin and end functions (including iterator), a size function and the possibility to use all of those for normal STL algorithms that work on containers / ranges through their iterators (e.g. transform, sort, find, etc.). At the same time, however, it is not a container itself, as it doesn't fit in picture of containers that store arbitary data. Also, it operates on the contained data mostly through member functions, like substr, find_first_of, etc., while true container don't do that and let the algorithms handle that. Additionally, the cplusplus reference site and the C++ standard don't list std::string together with the real containers, but in a distinct category. However, on SGI's STL site, basic_string (and consequently the string typedef) are mentioned with the other container and the basic_string reference site states that it belongs to the "containers" category. Now my question is, is string actually part of the STL or is it a distinct library itself? And if it belongs to the STL now, did it differ in the original STL developed by Stepanov?

 However, I'm unable to find certain reproduction path. Sometimes it occurs, sometimes it does not. I'm using NinjectHttpApplication for automatic controllers injection. Controllers are defined in separate assembly: public class App : NinjectHttpApplication

@TITLE:Can you overload + in haskell?
@CONTENT:While I've seen all kinds of weird things in Haskell sample code - I've never seen an operator plus being overloaded. Is there something special about it? Let's say I have a type like Pair, and I want to have something like  Pair(2,4) + Pair(1,2) = Pair(3,6)
 Can one do it in haskell? I am just curious, as I know it's possible in Scala in a rather elegant way.
@CODE:Pair(2,4) + Pair(1,2) = Pair(3,6) foo + bar foo.+(bar) + Num + Num

@TITLE:How can I prevent EF The context cannot be used while the model is being created errors?
@CONTENT:Looking at my Elmah error logs, I am seeing a few InvalidOperationExceptions from Entity Framework that deal with: The context cannot be used while the model is being created.
 This is with the latest EF CodeFirst library from Nuget. The only information I have been able to find on the net is that it is being caused by having data contexts as singletons, which is most certainly not my case. In my Windsor installer, my EF unit of work structure is being registered with: container.Register(Component.For<IUnitOfWork>()
                            .ImplementedBy<EFUnitOfWork>()
                            .LifeStyle
                            .PerWebRequest);
 I am able to recreate the error by hitting F5 in VS to start a debugging sessions, and while IIS is spinning up load up a second webpage to the debug session. I suspect it is because the user is trying to access the system while Asp.net has unloaded due to the lack of activity, which makes sense as my product is currently in a very very small beta test. However, since real people are using the website with live data, I need as little errors occurring as possible. Does anyone have any idea how to prevent this from occurring? Edit: I updated my windsor controller to now contain the following code:         container.Register(Component.For<IUnitOfWork>().ImplementedBy<EFUnitOfWork>().LifeStyle.PerWebRequest);
        using (var context = new MyJobLeadsDbContext())
        {
            context.Set<UnitTestEntity>().Any();
        }
 However, when I attempt to perform a 2nd web request while IIS is loading the application, the previous error still occurs Edit 2: As requested, here is the stack    at System.Data.Entity.Internal.LazyInternalContext.InitializeContext()

 Or is the only way to use compiler specific hints? (e.g. __builtin_expect on GCC) Will compilers treat the if conditions any differently based on the ordering of the conditions?

@LINK:/questions/2837070/lock-statement-vs-monitor-enter-method
@TITLE:Lock statement vs Monitor.Enter method
@CONTENT:I suppose it is an interesting code example. We have a class, let's call it Test with Finalize method. In Main method there are two code blocks where I am using a lock statement and a Monitor.Enter() call. Also, I have two instances of class Test here. The experiment is pretty simple: nulling Test variable within locking block and then try to collect it manually with GC.Collect method call. So, to see the Finalize call I am calling GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers method. Everything is very simple as you can see. By definition of lock statement it's opened by the compiler to try{...}finally{..} block with Monitor.Enter call inside of try block and Monitor. Then it exits in the finally block. I've tried to implement the try-finally block manually. I've expected the same behaviour in both cases. In case of using lock and in case of using Monitor.Enter. But, surprise, surprise it is different as you can see below. public class Test
{
    private string name;

    public Test(string name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }

    ~Test()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Finalizing class name {0}.", name));
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var test1 = new Test("Test1");
        var test2 = new Test("Tesst2");
        lock (test1)
        {
            test1 = null;
            Console.WriteLine("Manual collect 1.");
            GC.Collect();
            GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
            Console.WriteLine("Manual collect 2.");
            GC.Collect();
        }

        var lockTaken = false;
        System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(test2, ref lockTaken);
        try {
            test2 = null;
            Console.WriteLine("Manual collect 3.");
            GC.Collect();
            GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
            Console.WriteLine("Manual collect 4.");
            GC.Collect();
        }
        finally {
           System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(test2);
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
 Output of this example is Manual collect 1. Manual collect 2. Manual collect 3. Finalizing class name Test2. Manual collect 4. And null reference exception in last finally block because test2 is null reference. I was surprised and disassembled my code into IL. So, here is the IL dump of Main method. .entrypoint

 I don't see any difference between lock statement and Monitor.Enter call. So, why do I still have a reference to the instance of test1 in case of lock, and object is not collected by GC, but in case of using Monitor.Enter it is collected and finalized?

Until now i always end up creating a switch to toggle between file or folder selection dialogs or stick with drag-and-drop functionality only. Since this seems such a basic thing i would imagine this has been created before, but googling does not result in much information. So it looks like i would need to start from scratch and create a custom selection Dialog, but I rather not introduce any problems by reinventing the wheel for such a trivial task. Anybody any tips or existing solutions? To keep the UI consistent it would be nice if it is possible to extend the OpenFileDialog (or the FolderBrowserDialog).

Depending on this Accept header, the server can serve a different view on the same resource. Problem is that I didn't find a way to tell my browser to change this header. The <a..> tag has a type attribute, that can have a mime type, looked like a good candidate but the header was still the browser default (in Firefox it can be changed in about:config with the network.http.accept.default key).

@TITLE:boolean in an if statement
@CONTENT:Today I've gotten a remark about code considering the way I check whether a variable is true or false in a school assignment. The code which I had written was something like this: var booleanValue = true;

function someFunction(){
    if(booleanValue === true){
        return "something";
    }
}
 They said it was better/neater to write it like this: var booleanValue = true;

function someFunction(){
    if(booleanValue){
        return "something";
    }
}
 The remark which I have gotten about the "=== true" part was that it was not needed and could create confusion. However my idea is that it is better to check whether the variable is a boolean or not, especially since Javascript is a loosetyped language. In the second example a string would also return "something"; So my question; Is it neater to loose the "=== true" part in the future, or is it good practise to check the type of the variable as well. Edit: In my "real" code the boolean represents whether an image has been deleted or not, so the only values boolValue should ever have is true or false. 0 and 1 for example shouldn't be in that variable.
@CODE:var booleanValue = true;

function someFunction(){
    if(booleanValue === true){
        return "something";
    }
} var booleanValue = true;

function someFunction(){
    if(booleanValue){
        return "something";
    }
} === true [0] === true === true true

@TITLE:SlickGrid Vs JQGrid [closed]
@CONTENT:I am trying to decide between slickgrid and jqgrid. I think both of them are feature-rich. Jqgrid has great documentation, so its easy to get up & running. I am trying to understand, how different they are, in terms of implementation details since I heard slick grid is lot faster. I was just wondering if anyone did some benchmarking / know the internals of each grid to provide some useful inputs. Edit1: @oleg - Thanks for your response. Sorry, I was afraid that I might not have provided enough details. Although I do not have all the use-cases, but I will be using both the local data when data is small and server-side virtual scrolling, filtering, sorting etc. when data is large. Json will be the primary datasoure. I was trying to get inputs from someone who might understand the internals of both grids. I do not understand the client-side implementation enough to judge those myself. One of my colleague's mentioned that slick grid might be better since it was developed with virtual rendering and key-board support to being with. My question is open ended but the core-implementation of the grid might make it efficient in the more complex scenarios too i.e. sub-grids, trees etc. if there is no departure from the core design to handle any of those. Ok, based on ur expertise of jqgrid, how would you respond to this snippet from Slick Grid ? "Grid vs Data The key difference is between SlickGrid and other grid implementation I have seen is that they focus too much on being able to understand and work with data (search, sort, parse, ajax load, etc.) and not enough on being a better grid (or, in case of editable grids, a spreadsheet). Its great if all you want to do is spruce up an HTML TABLE or slap a front end onto a simple list, but too inflexible for anything else. Data is complicated. It has business rules. It has non-intrinsic properties. Editing one property of an element can lead to cascading changes modifying other properties or even other elements. It has dependencies. What Im saying, is that dealing with data is best left to the developer using the grid control. Trying to fit all of that into the grid implementation and API will only limit its applicability and add considerable bloat. SlickGrid takes a different approach. In the simplest scenario, it accesses data through an array interface (i.e. using dataitem to get to an item at a given position and data.length to determine the number of items), but the API is structured in such a way that it is very easy to make the grid react to any possible changes to the underlying data." Edit 2: Snippet from Datatables forum post : "*DataTables is trying to spruce up an HTML table. This can be seen, for example, by the use of the TABLE tag by DataTables, while SlickGrid uses DIV elements to create a display which looks like a table. As such, there are a number of techniques, like the virtual rendering, which can be used with the DIVs - but not with a table. It's not possible to simply render rows 100-110 and not the first 100 in a table, but it's no problem with DIVs, so I'm afraid that this isn't applicable at the moment. What would need to be done is to convert DataTables to using a DIV tag markup, but then you loose the primary goal of DataTables, which is focus on progressive enhancement and accessibility.*" Thanks

I'm basically looking to see the same things as I see when I use curl with the "verbose" option turned on. For example : curl -v http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.rss
 Would display both the sent data and the received data (including the headers, cookies, etc.). I have checked some related posts like : How do I log response in Spring RestTemplate? but I haven't managed to solve this issue. One way to do this would be to actually change the RestTemplate source code and add some extra logging statements there, but I would find this approach really a last resort thing. There should be some way to tell Spring Web Client/RestTemplate to log everything in a much friendlier way. My goal would be to be able to do this with code like : restTemplate.put("http://someurl", objectToPut, urlPathValues);
 and then to get the same type of debug information (as I get with curl) in the log file or in the console. I believe this would be extremely useful for anyone that uses the Spring RestTemplate and has problems. Using curl to debug your RestTemplate problems just doesn't work (in some cases).

My plan is to add the wiki as a remote to my main repo and keep everything in one place. However in the wiki repo everything is in the root directory and thus would clutter my main project. Has anyone tried this before? What is the best way to handle this?

@LINK:/questions/6648991/binding-initial-default-value-of-dropdown-select-list
@TITLE:Binding initial/default value of dropdown (select) list
@CONTENT:I'm having a small issue with setting the initial value of a dropdown. The code below is the view model definition and the initialization in $(document).ready. I have an array called sourceMaterialTypes and a selectedSourceMaterialType representing the selected value of that array. I am initializing the view model with values from the (ASP.Net MVC) Model and ViewBag. var viewModel = {
    sourceMaterialTypes : 
        ko.observableArray(@Html.Raw(Json.Encode(ViewBag.SourceMaterialTypes))),
    selectedSourceMaterialType :
        ko.observable(@Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.SourceMaterialType))),
    ingredientTypes :
        ko.observableArray(@Html.Raw(Json.Encode(ViewBag.IngredientTypes))),
    selectedIngredientType : ko.observable()
};

$(document).ready(function () {

    ko.applyBindings(viewModel);

    viewModel.selectedSourceMaterialType.subscribe(function(newSourceMaterialType) {
        $.getJSON("/IngredientType/FindByMaterialType",
                  { "id": newSourceMaterialType })
            .success(function (data) {
                viewModel.ingredientTypes($.parseJSON(data));
            })
            .error(function () { alert("error"); });
    });
});
 The following is the definition of my dropdown (select) list with the Knockout binding definition. <select id="SourceMaterialTypeId"
        name="SourceMaterialTypeId"
        data-bind="options: sourceMaterialTypes,
                   optionsText: 'Name',
                   optionsValue : 'Id',
                   value: selectedSourceMaterialType"></select>
 This all works fine except for the initially selected value in the source materials dropdown (selectedSourceMaterialType is bound correctly so when the dropdown selection changes its value is correctly updated, it is only the initial selection I am having a problem with), which is always the first item in the sourceMaterialTypes array on my view model. I would like the initially selected value to be that which is initialized from the (server-side) model as the value of selectedSourceMaterialType view model property.
@CODE:$(document).ready sourceMaterialTypes selectedSourceMaterialType var viewModel = {
    sourceMaterialTypes : 
        ko.observableArray(@Html.Raw(Json.Encode(ViewBag.SourceMaterialTypes))),
    selectedSourceMaterialType :
        ko.observable(@Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.SourceMaterialType))),
    ingredientTypes :
        ko.observableArray(@Html.Raw(Json.Encode(ViewBag.IngredientTypes))),
    selectedIngredientType : ko.observable()
};

$(document).ready(function () {

    ko.applyBindings(viewModel);

    viewModel.selectedSourceMaterialType.subscribe(function(newSourceMaterialType) {
        $.getJSON("/IngredientType/FindByMaterialType",
                  { "id": newSourceMaterialType })

                viewModel.ingredientTypes($.parseJSON(data));
            })
            .error(function () { alert("error"); });
    });
}); <select id="SourceMaterialTypeId"

                   optionsText: 'Name',

@CONTENT:I'm a bit confused with the way the canvas element anti-aliases text and am hoping you all can help. In the following screenshot the top "Quick Brown Fox" is an H1 element and the bottom one is a canvas element with text rendered on it.

One point pro-support of IE6 is that often in large organisations, the update of systems is often unimportant to their IT department, so theres a large proportion of people working in these organisations that still use IE6. Schools are the same. One point con-support of IE6 is that Microsoft no longer offer support for it, and it is considered a defunct browser, so why should I waste my time catering for it.

@TITLE:Bash and Test-Driven Development
@CONTENT:When writing more than a trivial script in bash, I often wonder how to make the code testable. It is typically hard to write tests for bash code, due to the fact that it is low on functions that take a value and return a value, and high on functions that check and set some aspect in the environment, modify the file-system, invoke a program, etc. - functions that depend on the environment or have side effects. Thus the setup and test code become much more complicated than the code they test. For example, consider a simple function to test: function add_to_file() {
  local f=$1
  cat >> $f
  sort -u $f -o $f
}
 Test code for this function might consist of: add_to_file.before: foo
bar
baz
 add_to_file.after: bar

 And test code: function test_add_to_file() {
   cp add_to_file.{before,tmp}
   add_to_file add_to_file.tmp
   cmp add_to_file.{tmp,after} && echo pass || echo fail
   rm add_to_file.tmp
}
 Here 5 lines of code are tested by 6 lines of test code and 7 lines of data. Now consider a slightly more complicated case: function distribute() {
   local file=$1 ; shift
   local hosts=( "$@" )
   for host in "${hosts[@]}" ; do
     rsync -ae ssh $file $host:$file
   done
}
 I can't even say how to start write a test for that... So, is there a good way to do TDD in bash scripts, or should I give up and put my efforts elsewhere?
@CODE:function add_to_file() {
  local f=$1
  cat >> $f
  sort -u $f -o $f

@TITLE:Unable to load image when selected from the gallery on Android 4.4 (KitKat) using PhoneGap Camera Plugin
@CONTENT:I'm trying to set the source of an img tag in my app based on the image chosen from the device image gallery using the PhoneGap/Cordova Camera Plugin. It has worked previously as intended on older versions of Android (3.3) and works fine on iOS but now fails to resolve the image path on 4.4 (KitKat). The returned path for the returned image url looks something like: content://com.android.providers.media.documents/document/image%3A352
 When I use this path to set as the image src via JavaScript, the URL cannot be resolved and therefore produces a load error. There is no issue when taking a picture with the camera, it only seems to occur when choosing an existing picture from the gallery. I have tried encoding to base64 and also tried the method mentioned in the docs resolveLocalFileSystemURI(); but I have had no luck with these. I've also tried removing the camera plugin and rebuilding the app but no joy. My guess is that something has changed with the way KitKat handles the gallery and PhoneGap/Camera plugin haven't been updated to accomodate for this yet.

 A sample of the xml data of a row would be: <Sqm version="1.2">

 In the case of this data, I would want: SqmId  id                                                   type   unit  count  sum      minValue  maxValue  standardDeviation  Value

 In the end I'll actually be performing SUM(), MIN(), MAX() aggregation. But for now I'm just trying to query an xml column. In pseudo-code, I would try something like: SELECT

 But that SQL query doesn't work: Msg 2396, Level 16, State 1, Line 2 XQuery [Sqm.data.query()]: Attribute may not appear outside of an element I've hunted, and it's amazing how poorly documented, or exampled, Xml querying is.

checkState a = ...
 (Obviously, this is an stupid, incomplete example). But this is a lot for a little use, no? Why I shouldn't do something simple and only defining functions without defining new data types and typeclasses (with their instances). This example is too simple, but in facts I often see somethings like that (new data types+typeclasses+instances) when I browse Haskell code on github instead of only defining functions. So, when I should create new data types, typeclasses etc and when should I use functions? Thanks.

@TITLE:Unwind segue with Navigation back button
@CONTENT:I have watched the apple demo video on storyboard implementation with the unwind segues section and seen the demo using custom buttons on the main view. That works fine. I have also seen a good example of the same thing here which works also. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Using_Xcode_Storyboarding_%28iOS_6%29#Unwinding_Storyboard_Segues However, I wish to have a normal push segue passing from parent (with main form data) to child (with advanced settings options) and then return to the parent view controller using the back button in the navigation bar rather than with a custom button on the view as shown in the demo. The parent controller will then save everything to an API server when a further save button on the parent controller is pressed. I dont seem to be able to override the navigation back button to point it down to my unwind segue action and since the back button doesnt appear on the storyboard, I cant drag the green Exit button to it I tried this in viewDidLoad to overrride the action, but it didnt work [self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem setAction:@selector(unwindSegueAction:)]; Is it possible to unwind a push segue with the back button? The best idea I had so far was to override the back button from the viewDidLoad method, but that removes the angled back button style and also seems like a rough hack to a simple problem self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"back" style:UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered target:self action:@selector(unwindSegue:)];
 I know there are answers for using protocol and delegates, but I am interested in using the Xcode4.5 unwind segue method

@LINK:/questions/9178254/why-do-logicals-booleans-in-r-require-4-bytes
@TITLE:Why do logicals (booleans) in R require 4 bytes?
@CONTENT:For a vector of logical values, why does R allocate 4 bytes, when a bit vector would consume 1 bit per entry? (See this question for examples.) Now, I realize that R also facilitates storage of NA values, but couldn't that be done with an additional bit vector? In other words, why isn't it enough to just use a cheap two bit data structure? For what it's worth, Matlab uses 1 byte for logicals, though it doesn't facilitate NA values. I'm not sure why MathWorks isn't satisfied with one bit functionality, much less a two bit data structure, but they have fancy pants marketers... [I'm gonna milk "two bit" for all it's worth in this question. ;-)] Update 1. I think that the architecture reasons offered make some sense, but that feels a little ex post facto. I haven't checked 32 bit or 16 bit R to see how large their logicals are - that could lend some support to the idea. It seems, from the R Internals manual that logical vectors (LGLSXP) and integers (INTSXP) are 32 bits on every platform. I can understand a universal size for integers, independent of word size. Similarly, storage of logicals also seems to be independent of word size. But it's so BIG. :) In addition, if the word size argument is so powerful, it seems strange to me to see Matlab (I think it's a 32 bit Matlab) consume only 1 byte - I wonder if MathWorks chose to be more memory efficient with a tradeoff for programming complexity and some other overhead for finding sub-word objects. Also, there are certainly other options in are: as Brian Diggs notes, the bit package facilitates bit vectors, which was very useful for the problem in the question above (an 8X-10X speedup for the task was obtained by converting from 4 byte logical values to bit vectors). Although speed of accessing memory is important, moving 30-31 extra uninformative bits (from an information theory perspective) is wasteful. For instance, one could use something like the memory tricks used for integers described here - grab a bunch of extra memory (V cells) and then process things at the bit level (a la bit()). Why not do that and save 30 bits (1 for the value, 1 for NA) for a long vector? To the extent that my RAM and computational speed are affected by booleans, I intend to switch over to using bit, but that's because a 97% savings in space matters in some cases. :) I think that the answer to this question will come from someone with a deeper understanding of R's design or internals. The best example is that Matlab uses a different size for their logical, and memory word sizes wouldn't be the answer in that case. Python may be similar to R, for what it's worth. A related way to phrase this might be: why would LGLSXP be 4 bytes on all platforms? (Is CHARSXP typically smaller, and wouldn't that work as well? Why not go even smaller, and just over-allocate?) (Updated The idea of using CHARSXP is likely bogus, because operations on CHARSXP aren't as fully useful as those for integers, such as sum. Using the same data structure as characters might save space, but would constrain which existing methods could operate on it. A more appropriate consideration is the use of smaller integers, as discussed below.) Update 2. There have been some very good and enlightening answers here, especially relative to how one should implement retrieval and processing of booleans for the goals of speed and programming efficiency. I think that Tommy's answer is particularly plausible regarding the why it appears this way in R, which seems to arise from 2 premises: In order to support addition on a logical vector (note that "logical" is defined by programming language / environment, and is not the same as a boolean), one is best served by reusing code for adding integers. In the case of R, integers consume 4 bytes. In the case of Matlab, the smallest integer is 1 byte (i.e. int8). This would explain why something different would be a nuisance to write for logicals. [To those not familiar with R, it supports many numerical operations on logicals, such as sum(myVector), mean(myVector), etc.] Legacy support makes it exceedingly difficult to do something other than what has been done in R and S-Plus for a long time now. Moreover, I suspect that in the early days of S, S-Plus, and R, if someone was doing a lot of boolean operations, they did them in C, rather than trying to do so much work with logicals in R. The other answers are fantastic for the purposes of how one might implement better boolean handling - don't naively assume that one can get at any individual bit: it's most efficient to load a word, then mask the bits that are not of interest, as Dervall has described. This is very, very useful advice should one write specialized code for boolean manipulation for R (e.g. my question on cross tabulations): don't iterate over bits, but instead work at the word level. Thanks to all for a very thorough set of answers and insights.

@LINK:/questions/4904049/php-array-performance
@TITLE:PHP array performance
@CONTENT:this is my first question on Stackoverflow, please bear with me. I'm testing an algorithm for 2d bin packing and I've chosen PHP to mock it up as it's my bread-and-butter language nowadays. As you can see on http://themworks.com/pack_v0.2/oopack.php?ol=1 it works pretty well, but you need to wait around 10-20 seconds for 100 rectangles to pack. For some hard to handle sets it would hit the php's 30s runtime limit. I did some profiling and it shows that most of the time my script goes through different parts of a small 2d array with 0's and 1's in it. It either checks if certain cell equals to 0/1 or sets it to 0/1. It can do such operations million times and each times it takes few microseconds. I guess I could use an array of booleans in a statically typed language and things would be faster. Or even make an array of 1 bit values. I'm thinking of converting the whole thing to some compiled language. Is PHP just not good for it? If I do need to convert it to let's say C++, how good are the automatic converters? My script is just a lot of for loops with basic arrays and objects manipulations. Thank you! Edit. This function gets called more than any other. It reads few properties of a very simple object, and goes through a very small part of a smallish array to check if there's any element not equal to 0. function fits($bin, $w, $h, $x, $y) {

    $w += $x;
    $h += $y;

    for ($i = $x; $i < $w; $i++) {

        for ($j = $y; $j < $h; $j++) {

            if ($bin[$i][$j] !== 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;    
}
 Update: I've tried using 1d array instead of 2d as one of the answers suggested. Since I needed to always have current bin width accessible, I decided to wrap everything in the object. Also, now in every loop the index needs to be calculated. Now the script takes even more time to run. Other techniques didn't bring much performance boost, rather made code less readable. Time for HipHop I guess. Update: since hiphop php only runs on linux, and I don't have one, I've decided to rewrite the whole thing in C++. It's nice to freshen up the old skills. Also, if I do find a way to use hiphop, it'll be interesting to compare hand-written C++ code and the one hiphop would generate. Update: I rewrote this thing in c++, on average it works 20 times faster and uses much less memory. Let me see if I can make it even faster.
@CODE:function fits($bin, $w, $h, $x, $y) {

    $w += $x;
    $h += $y;

    for ($i = $x; $i < $w; $i++) {

        for ($j = $y; $j < $h; $j++) {

            if ($bin[$i][$j] !== 0) {

@LINK:/questions/2926205/does-every-excel-interop-object-need-to-be-released-using-marshal-releasecomob
@TITLE:Does *every* Excel interop object need to be released using Marshal.ReleaseComObject?
@CONTENT:Edit Please see also How to properly clean up Excel interop objects in C#. I recently came across this question, and it provided a lot of insight into the problem of how to properly dispose of COM objects. Definitely check beyond the first (marked) answer, because the other answers go beyond the simple "don't use two dots" and "use ReleaseComObject for every com object" advice. I revisited this question in the first place because I realized that, despite being very thorough about registering and disposing all my COM objects, my Excel instances still weren't being properly disposed. It turns out, there are ways COM objects can be created that are completely non-obvious (i.e., you can miss COM objects even if you never use two dots). In addition, even if you are thorough, if your project grows beyond a certain size, the chance of missing a COM object approaches 100%. And it can be very hard to find the one you missed when that happens. The answers to the question linked above provide some other techniques for making sure the Excel instance definitely gets closed. Meanwhile, I've made a small (but significant) update to my ComObjectManager (below) to reflect what I learned from the question linked above. Original Question I've seen several examples where Marshal.ReleaseComObject() is used with Excel Interop objects (i.e., objects from namespace Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel), but I've seen it used to various degrees. I'm wondering if I can get away with something like this: var application = new ApplicationClass();
try
{
    // do work with application, workbooks, worksheets, cells, etc.
}
finally
{
    Marashal.ReleaseComObject(application)
}
 Or if I need to release every single object created, as in this method: public void CreateExcelWorkbookWithSingleSheet()
{
    var application = new ApplicationClass();
    var workbook = application.Workbooks.Add(_missing);
    var worksheets = workbook.Worksheets;
    for (var worksheetIndex = 1; worksheetIndex < worksheets.Count; worksheetIndex++)
    {
        var worksheet = (WorksheetClass)worksheets[worksheetIndex];
        worksheet.Delete();
        Marshal.ReleaseComObject(worksheet);
    }
    workbook.SaveAs(
        WorkbookPath, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing,
        XlSaveAsAccessMode.xlExclusive, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing);
    workbook.Close(true, _missing, _missing);
    application.Quit();
    Marshal.ReleaseComObject(worksheets);
    Marshal.ReleaseComObject(workbook);
    Marshal.ReleaseComObject(application);
}
 What prompted me to ask this question is that, being the LINQ devotee I am, I really want to do something like this: var worksheetNames = worksheets.Cast<Worksheet>().Select(ws => ws.Name);
 ...but I'm concerned I'll end up with memory leaks or ghost processes if I don't release each worksheet (ws) object. Any insight on this would be appreciated. Update Based on the answers so far, it sounds like I really do need to release every single com object I create. I took the opportunity to build a ComObjectManager class to make it a little easier to deal with this headache. You have to remember to use the Get() method each time you instantiate a new com object, but if you do, it will take care of everything else for you. Please let me know if you see any problems with it (or edit and leave a comment if you are able). Here's the code: public class ComObjectManager : IDisposable
{
    private Stack<object> _comObjects = new Stack<object>();

    public TComObject Get<TComObject>(Func<TComObject> getter)
    {
        var comObject = getter();
        _comObjects.Push(comObject);
        return comObject;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // these two lines of code will dispose of any unreferenced COM objects
        GC.Collect();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

        while (_comObjects.Count > 0)
            Marshal.ReleaseComObject(_comObjects.Pop());
    }
}
 Here's a usage example: public void CreateExcelWorkbookWithSingleSheet()
{
    using (var com = new ComObjectManager())
    {
        var application = com.Get<ApplicationClass>(() => new ApplicationClass());
        var workbook = com.Get<Workbook>(() => application.Workbooks.Add(_missing));
        var worksheets = com.Get<Sheets>(() => workbook.Worksheets);
        for (var worksheetIndex = 1; worksheetIndex < worksheets.Count; worksheetIndex++)
        {
            var worksheet = com.Get<WorksheetClass>(() => (WorksheetClass)worksheets[worksheetIndex]);
            worksheet.Delete();
        }
        workbook.SaveAs(
            WorkbookPath, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing,
            XlSaveAsAccessMode.xlExclusive, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing, _missing);
        workbook.Close(true, _missing, _missing);

@CONTENT:I'm trying to use Valgrind on a program that I'm working on, but Valgrind generates a bunch of errors for one of the libraries that I'm using. I'd like to be able to tell it to suppress all errors which involve that library. The closest rule that I can come up with for the suppression file is {
   rule name

 This doesn't entirely do the job, however. I have to create one of these for every suppression type that comes up (Cond, Value4, Param, etc), and it seems to still miss some errors which have the library in the stack trace. Is there a way to give Valgrind a single suppression rule to make it completely ignore a particular library? And even if there is no way to make such a rule which covers all suppression types, is there at least a way to create a rule which ignores all errors of a particular suppression type from a particular library?

@TITLE:How do I execute multiple SQL Statements in Access' Query Editor?
@CONTENT:I have a text file with a few SQL statements in it that I want to run on an Access database. I thought that should be possible with Access' Query Editor. So, I go into this editor and paste the statements: insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2000')
insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2001')
insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2002')
insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2003')
 Trying to run them (by hitting the red exclamation mark) I receive a Missing semicolon (;) at end of SQL statement. This could be taken as an indication that the editor would allow to execute multiple statements. So, I change the statements and append such a semicolon at the end: insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2000');
insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2001');
insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2002');
insert into aFewYears (yr) values ('2003');
 Then I get a Characters found after end of SQL statement. which probably could be taken as an indication that it is not possible to execute multiple statements. Ok, so the question: is it possible to execute multiple statements in the query editor, or is it possible to somehow batch-execute sql statements in a file in/on/against Access. Thanks / Rene edit The insert statements were used as an example and I realize that they are less than perfect, because they all go to the same table and such a thing can obviously somehow be solved by using one statement that has a union or something. In my actual case that I am trying to solve, the file contains not only insert statements but also create table statements and insert statements with different underlying tables. So I hoped (and still hope) that there is something like my beloved SQL*Plus for Oracle that can execute a file with all kinds of SQL Statements.

@TITLE:Optional function parameters: Use default arguments (NULL) or overload the function?
@CONTENT:I have a function that processes a given vector, but may also create such a vector itself if it is not given. I see two design choices for such a case, where a function parameter is optional: Make it a pointer and make it NULL by default: void foo(int i, std::vector<int>* optional = NULL) {
  if(optional == NULL){
    optional = new std::vector<int>();
    // fill vector with data
  }
  // process vector
}
 Or have two functions with an overloaded name, one of which leaves out the argument: void foo(int i) {
   std::vector<int> vec;
   // fill vec with data
   foo(i, vec);
}

void foo(int i, const std::vector<int>& optional) {
  // process vector
}
 Are there reasons to prefer one solution over the other? I slightly prefer the second one because I can make the vector a const reference, since it is, when provided, only read, not written. Also, the interface looks cleaner (isn't NULL just a hack?). And the performance difference resulting from the indirect function call is probably optimized away. Yet, I often see the first solution in code. Are there compelling reasons to prefer it, apart from programmer laziness?
@CODE:NULL void foo(int i, std::vector<int>* optional = NULL) {
  if(optional == NULL){
    optional = new std::vector<int>();

@TITLE:Does C# .NET support IDispatch late binding?
@CONTENT:The Question My question is: Does C# nativly support late-binding IDispatch? Pretend i'm trying to automate Office, while being compatible with whatever version the customer has installed. In the .NET world if you developed with Office 2000 installed, every developer, and every customer, from now until the end of time, is required to have Office 2000. In the world before .NET, we used COM to talk to Office applications. For example: 1) Use the version independant ProgID "Excel.Application"
 which resolves to: clsid = {00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
 and then using COM, we ask for one of these classes to be instantiated into an object: IUnknown unk;
CoCreateInstance(
    clsid, 
    null,
    CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER | CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER,
    IUnknown, 
    out unk);
 And now we're off to the races - able to use Excel from inside my application. Of course, if really you want to use the object, you have to call have some way of calling methods. We could get ahold of the various interface declarations, translated into our language. This technique is good because we get early binding code-insight compile type syntax checking and some example code might be: Application xl = (IExcelApplication)unk;
ExcelWorkbook workbook = xl.Workbooks.Add(template, lcid);
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.ActiveSheet;
 But there is a downside of using interfaces: we have to get ahold of the various interface declarations, transated into our language. And we're stuck using method-based invocations, having to specify all parameters, e.g.: ExcelWorkbook workbook = xl.Workbooks.Add(template, lcid);
xl.Worksheets.Add(before, after, count, type, lcid);
 This has proved, in the real world, to have such downsides that we would willingly give up: early binding code-insight compile time syntax checking and instead use IDispatch late binding: Variant xl = (IDispatch)unk;
Variant newWorksheet = xl.Worksheets.Add();
 Because Excel automation was designed for VB Script, a lot of parameters can be ommitted, even when there is no overload without them. Note: Don't confuse my example of Excel with a reason of why i want to use IDispatch. Not every COM object is Excel. Some COM objects have no support other than through IDispatch.
@CODE:"Excel.Application" clsid = {00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} IUnknown unk;
CoCreateInstance(
    clsid, 
    null,
    CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER | CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER,
    IUnknown, 
    out unk); Application xl = (IExcelApplication)unk;
ExcelWorkbook workbook = xl.Workbooks.Add(template, lcid);
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.ActiveSheet; ExcelWorkbook workbook = xl.Workbooks.Add(template, lcid);
xl.Worksheets.Add(before, after, count, type, lcid); Variant xl = (IDispatch)unk;
Variant newWorksheet = xl.Worksheets.Add();

@LINK:/questions/19267408/why-does-stdmove-prevent-rvo
@TITLE:Why does std::move prevent RVO?
@CONTENT:In many cases when returning a local from a function, RVO kicks in. However, I thought that explicitly using std::move would at least enforce moving when RVO does not happen, but that RVO is still applied when possible. However, it seems that this is not the case. #include "iostream"

class HeavyWeight
{
public:
    HeavyWeight()
    {
        std::cout << "ctor" << std::endl;
    }

    HeavyWeight(const HeavyWeight& other)
    {
        std::cout << "copy" << std::endl;
    }

    HeavyWeight(HeavyWeight&& other)
    {
        std::cout << "move" << std::endl;
    }
};

HeavyWeight MakeHeavy()
{
    HeavyWeight heavy;
    return heavy;
}

int main()
{
    auto heavy = MakeHeavy();
    return 0;
}
 I tested this code with VC++11 and GCC 4.71, debug and release (-O2) config. The copy ctor is never called. The move ctor is only called by VC++11 in debug config. Actually, everything seems to be fine with these compilers in particular, but to my knowledge, RVO is optional. However, if I explicitly use move: HeavyWeight MakeHeavy()
{
    HeavyWeight heavy;
    return std::move(heavy);
}
 the move ctor is always called. So trying to make it "safe" makes it worse. My questions are: - Why does std::move prevent RVO? - When is it better to "hope for the best" and rely on RVO, and when should I explicitly use std::move? Or, in other words, how can I let the compiler optimization do its work and still enforce move if RVO is not applied?
@CODE:std::move #include "iostream"

class HeavyWeight
{
public:
    HeavyWeight()
    {
        std::cout << "ctor" << std::endl;

@TITLE:How to support HTTP OPTIONS verb in ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI application
@CONTENT:I've setup an ASP.NET web application starting with a MVC 4/Web API template. It seems as though things are working really well - no problems that I'm aware of. I've used Chrome and Firefox to go through the site. I've tested using Fiddler and all of the responses seem to be on the money. So now I proceed to write a simple Test.aspx to consume this new Web API. The relevant parts of the script: <script type="text/javascript">
    $(function () {

        $.ajax({
            url: "http://mywebapidomain.com/api/user",
            type: "GET",

                $.each(data, function (index, item) {

                    ....

                    });
                }

            },

            error: function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
                alert("An error occurred, please try again. " + textStatus);
            }

        });

    });

<Error><Message>The requested resource does not support http method 'OPTIONS'.</Message></Error>
 I understand that the OPTIONS verb is not wired up in Web API controllers by default... So, I placed the following code in my UserController.cs: // OPTIONS http-verb handler
public HttpResponseMessage OptionsUser()
{
    var response = new HttpResponseMessage();
    response.StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK;
    return response;
}

 There must be additional logic... I don't know how to properly code the Options method or if the controller is even the proper place to put the code. Weird (to me) that the Web API site responds properly when viewed from Firefox or Chrome, yet the .ajax call above errors out. How do I handle the "preflight" check in the .ajax code? Maybe I should be addressing this issue on the client side's .ajax logic? Or, if this is an issue on the server side due to not handling the OPTIONS verb. Can anyone help? This must be a very common issue and I apologize if it's been answered here. I searched but didn't find any answers that helped. UPDATE IMHO, this is a client side issue and has to do with the Ajax JQuery code above. I say this because Fiddler doesn't show any 405 error headers when I access mywebapidomain/api/user from a web browser. The only place I can duplicate this problem is from the JQuery .ajax() call. Also, the identical Ajax call above works fine when ran on the server (same domain). I found another post: Prototype AJAX request being sent as OPTIONS rather than GET; results in 501 error that seems to be related, but I've tinkered with their suggestions with no success. Apparently, JQuery is coded so that if an Ajax request is cross domain (which mine is) it adds a couple of headers which trigger the OPTIONS header somehow. 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
'X-Prototype-Version': Prototype.Version,
 It just seems that there should be a better solution available than modifying core code in JQuery... The answer provided below assumes this is a server side issue. Maybe, I guess, but I lean toward client and calling a hosting provider isn't going to help.

@LINK:/questions/14185985/passing-by-value-vs-const-and-overloads
@TITLE:Passing by value vs const & and && overloads
@CONTENT:So after looking up move semantics I see that general consensus is to pass by value when you intend to transfer ownership. But in Scott Meyer's talk on Universal references I've noticed that std::vector::push_back has 2 overloads: void push_back( const T& value );
void push_back( T&& value );
 So I thought to myself, wouldn't void push_back( T value ); be enough? I've asked a few people which ultimately lead to the following test case: #include <memory>
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

struct A
{
    A() { std::cout << "A Default constructor\n"; }
    A(const A &) { std::cout << "A Copy\n"; }
    A(A &&) { std::cout << "A Move\n"; }
};

std::aligned_storage<sizeof(A)> contents;
A& alias = *reinterpret_cast<A*>(&contents);

void ByVal(A a)
{
    new (&contents) A(std::move(a));
    alias.~A();
}

void ByLCRef(A const& a)
{
    new (&contents) A(a);
    alias.~A();
}

void ByRRef(A&& a)
{
    new (&contents) A(std::move(a));
    alias.~A();
}

int main()
{
    A a;
    std::cout << "\n";
    std::cout << "ByVal(a);\n";
    ByVal(a);
    std::cout << "ByVal(std::move(a));\n";
    ByVal(std::move(a));
    std::cout << "ByVal(A());\n";
    ByVal(A());
    std::cout << "ByLCRef(a);\n";
    ByLCRef(a);
    std::cout << "ByRRef(std::move(a));\n";
    ByRRef(std::move(a));
    std::cout << "ByRRef(A());\n";
    ByRRef(A());
}
 Which produces the following: A Default constructor

ByVal(a);
A Copy
A Move
ByVal(std::move(a));
A Move
A Move
ByVal(A());
A Default constructor
A Move
ByLCRef(a);
A Copy
ByRRef(std::move(a));
A Move
ByRRef(A());
A Default constructor
A Move
 As you can see, ByVal produces 1 extra move compared to pair of reference overloads. So the question is: is it worth it? When would you create two overloads instead of one simple pass by value function?
@CODE:std::vector::push_back void push_back( const T& value );
void push_back( T&& value ); void push_back( T value ); #include <memory>
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

struct A

@LINK:/questions/12994679/golang-slice-of-struct-slice-of-interface-it-implements
@TITLE:golang: slice of struct != slice of interface it implements?
@CONTENT:Disclaimer: I'm a Go noob, hacking away while learning. Any advice is appreciated, but only if accompanied with code examples :-) I have an interface Model, which is implemented by struct Person. To get a model instance, I have the following helper functions: func newModel(c string) Model {
    switch c {
    case "person":
        return newPerson()
    }
    return nil
}

func newPerson() *Person {
    return &Person{}
}
 The above approach allows me to return a properly typed Person instance (can easily add new models later with same approach). When I attempted to do something similar for returning a slice of models, I get an error. Code: func newModels(c string) []Model {
    switch c {
    case "person":
        return newPersons()
    }
    return nil
}

func newPersons() *[]Person {
    var models []Person
    return &models
}
 Go complains with: cannot use newPersons() (type []Person) as type []Model in return argument My goal is to return a slice of whatever model type is requested (whether []Person, []FutureModel, []Terminator2000, w/e). What am I missing, and how can I properly implement such a solution?
@CODE:Model Person func newModel(c string) Model {
    switch c {
    case "person":
        return newPerson()
    }
    return nil
}

func newPerson() *Person {
    return &Person{}
} func newModels(c string) []Model {
    switch c {
    case "person":
        return newPersons()
    }
    return nil
}

func newPersons() *[]Person {
    var models []Person
    return &models
} cannot use newPersons() (type []Person) as type []Model in return argument []Person []FutureModel []Terminator2000 /api/{collection}

@TITLE:How to unzip a file in Ruby on Rails?
@CONTENT:I'm uploading a file to the server in Ruby on Rails Normally, it's a text file and I save it in the model as a 'file' field in a Submission ActiveRecord with other fields such as title of submission.. etc. However, the user can also submit a zip file. In this case the zipfile should unzipped and for each file in the zip a new Submission should be created with the same text fields, but current file. How can I accomplish this? I looked at unzip examples on the net, but most use a directory to unzip the files to. I'm not sure if I need that as in the current create method of SubmissionsController, a file object is received and I presume the path to save the file to is automatically generated when the Submission save method is called. So I was thinking that maybe I should unzip the zipfile in memory to get an array of file objects and then create a new Submission with each file object but same fields and then let ActiveRecord generate the file paths for each one when it saves them to the database. I might be wrong here, because I'm kind of new to Rails and Ruby.

@TITLE:Exporting data from SQL Server Express to CSV (need quoting and escaping)
@CONTENT:I've spent 2 days trying to export a 75,000 row table containing a large text field of user input data from a SQL server installation. This data contains every plain ascii character, tabs, and newlines. I need to export CSV where every field is quoted, and quotes within the quoted columns are properly escaped (""). Here is what I've tried so far: - Right clicking on the database from Management Studio and exporting to Excel: fails due to the field being too long. - Data Export from Management Studio to flat file with " text separator and comma separation - completely useless, does not escape quotes within a field making the file completely ambiguous. - BCP from command line - also does not support quoting fields. I need to import with the FasterCSV ruby library. It does not allow the quote delimiter to be a non-standard ascii character or more than one character. It also does not allow \n or \r in unquoted columns. Any help is greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Get Local IP-Address using Boost.Asio
@CONTENT:I'm currently searching for a portable way of getting the local IP-addresses. Because I'm using Boost anyway I thought it would be a good idea to use Boost.Asio for this task. There are several examples on the net which should do the trick. Examples: Official Boost.Asio Documentation Some Asian Page I tried both codes with just slight modifications. The Code on Boost.Doc was changed to not resolve "www.boost.org" but "localhost" or my hostname instead. For getting the hostname I used boost::asio::ip::host_name() or typed it directly as a string. Additionally I wrote my own code which was a merge of the above examples and my (little) knowledge I gathered from the Boost Documentation and other examples. All the sources worked, but they did just return the following IP: 127.0.1.1 (That's not a typo, its .1.1 at the end) I run and compiled the code on Ubuntu 9.10 with GCC 4.4.1 A colleague tried the same code on his machine and got 127.0.0.2 (Not a typo too...) He compiled and run on Suse 11.0 with GCC 4.4.1 (I'm not 100% sure) I don't know if it is possible to change the localhost (127.0.0.1), but I know that neither me or my colleague did it. ifconfig says loopback uses 127.0.0.1. ifconfig also finds the public IP I am searching for (141.200.182.30 in my case, subnet is 255.255.0.0) So is this a Linux-issue and the code is not as portable as I thought? Do I have to change something else or is Boost.Asio not working as a solution for my problem at all? I know there are much questions about similar topics on Stackoverflow and other pages, but I cannot find information which is useful in my case. If you got useful links, it would be nice if you could point me to it. PS: Here is the modified code I used from Boost.Doc: #include <boost/asio.hpp>
using boost::asio::ip::tcp;    

boost::asio::io_service io_service;
tcp::resolver resolver(io_service);
tcp::resolver::query query(boost::asio::ip::host_name(), "");

So an actual link to a working solution is the goal here. Note: I'm looking for a generic tree, not a balanced tree or a map/set, the structure itself and the connectivity of the tree is important in this case, not only the data within.

@TITLE:AutoLayout multiline UILabel cutting off some text
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn auto layout, finally thought I was getting the hang on it when this happened. I'm playing about with prototype cells and labels. I'm trying to have a Title, titleLbl - blue box in picture Money, moneyLbl - green box in picture Subtitle / Description, subTitleLbl - red box in picture So far I have this: What I want to achieve is: The green box should always display on 1 line fully The value inside the green box should be centred based on the blue box The blue box will take the remaining space (-8px for horizontal constraint between the 2) and display on multiple lines if necessary The red box should be underneath and display as many lines as needed. As you can see this is nearly all working, with the exception of the example in the last row. I've tried to research this and from what I can gather it is something to do with the intrinsic content size. Many posts online recommend setting setPreferredMaxLayoutWidth, i've done this in multiple places for the titleLbl and it has had no effect. Only when hardcoding it to 180 did I get the results, but it also added whitespace / padding to the other blue boxes on top / underneath the text, greatly increasing the space between the red / blue boxes. Here are my constraints: Title: Money: Subtitle: Based on tests i've run with other text samples it does appear to be using the width as shown in the storyboard, but any attempt to correct it isn't working. I have created an ivar of the cell and used it to create the height of the cell: - (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    [sizingCellTitleSubMoney.titleLbl setText:[[tableViewData objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@"title"]];
    [sizingCellTitleSubMoney.subtitleLbl setText:[[tableViewData objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@"subtitle"]];
    [sizingCellTitleSubMoney.moneyLbl setText:[[tableViewData objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@"cost"]];

    [sizingCellTitleSubMoney layoutIfNeeded];

    CGSize size = [sizingCellTitleSubMoney.contentView systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:UILayoutFittingCompressedSize];
    return size.height+1;
}

- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    MATitleSubtitleMoneyTableViewCell *cell = [self.tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifierTitleSubTitleMoney];

    if(!cell)
    {
        cell = [[MATitleSubtitleMoneyTableViewCell alloc] init];
    }


    cell.titleLbl.layer.borderColor = [UIColor blueColor].CGColor;
    cell.titleLbl.layer.borderWidth = 1;

    cell.subtitleLbl.layer.borderColor = [UIColor redColor].CGColor;
    cell.subtitleLbl.layer.borderWidth = 1;

    cell.moneyLbl.layer.borderColor = [UIColor greenColor].CGColor;
    cell.moneyLbl.layer.borderWidth = 1;


    [cell.titleLbl setText:[[tableViewData objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@"title"]];
    [cell.subtitleLbl setText:[[tableViewData objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@"subtitle"]];
    [cell.moneyLbl setText:[[tableViewData objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] objectForKey:@"cost"]];

    return cell;
}
 I've tried setting setPreferredMaxLayoutWidth inside the cell's layout subviews: - (void)layoutSubviews
{
    [super layoutSubviews];

    NSLog(@"Money lbl: %@", NSStringFromCGRect(self.moneyLbl.frame));
    NSLog(@"prefferredMaxSize: %f \n\n", self.moneyLbl.frame.origin.x-8);

    [self.titleLbl setPreferredMaxLayoutWidth: self.moneyLbl.frame.origin.x-8];
}
 log: 2014-04-30 21:37:32.475 AutoLayoutTestBed[652:60b] Money lbl: {{209, 20}, {91, 61}}
2014-04-30 21:37:32.475 AutoLayoutTestBed[652:60b] prefferredMaxSize: 201.000000 
 Which is what I would expect as there is 8px between the 2 elements and the console verifies this. It works perfectly on the first row no matter how much text I add to the blue box, which is the same as the storyboard, but any increase to the green box throws off the width calculation. I've tried setting this in the tableView:willDisplayCell and the tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: as well based on answers from other questions. But no matter what it just doesn't layout. Any help, ideas or comments would be greatly appreciated

@TITLE:window.onpopstate on page load
@CONTENT:I'm playing with window.onpopstate, and there is a thing that annoys me a little bit: Browsers tend to handle the popstate event differently on page load. Chrome and Safari always emit a popstate event on page load, but Firefox doesn't. source I tested it, and yeah, in Chrome and Safari 5.1+ the popstate event is fired on page load, but not in Firefox or IE10. The problem is, that I want to listen only to popstate events where user clicked the back or forward button (or the history was changed via javascript), but don't want to do anything on pageload. By other words I want to differentiate the popstate event from page load from the other popstate events. This is what I tried so far (I'm using jQuery): $(function() {
  console.log('document ready');

  setTimeout(function() {
    window.onpopstate = function(event) {
      // Do something here
    }, 10);
});
 Basically I try to bind my listener function to popstate late enough to be not binded on page load, only later. This seems to work, however, I don't like this solution. I mean, how can I be sure that the timeout choosed for setTimeout is big enough, but not too big (cause I don't want it to wait to much). I hope there is a smarter solution!
@CODE:window.onpopstate popstate popstate popstate $(function() {
  console.log('document ready');

  setTimeout(function() {
    window.onpopstate = function(event) {
      // Do something here
    }, 10);
}); listener popstate

@TITLE:Selenium Grid: MaxSessions vs MaxInstances
@CONTENT:I was wondering if anybody could shed some light on a Selenium question that has been giving us a bit of head scratching. We're confused on meaning of MaxSession and MaxInstances of Selenium Grid. We think that the MaxSession is the total number of test sessions that can run on a single node. And we also think that the MaxInstances is the total number of browsers that a test can open. Or is MaxInstances the total number of browsers available to the node? The command that we are using is java -Xrs -jar selenium-server.jar -role node -port 44506 -hub http://localhost:44500
/grid/register -firefoxProfileTemplate SeleniumProfile -timeout 300000 -browser 
"browserName=firefox,maxInstances=10,platform=ANY,seleniumProtocol=WebDriver" -browser 
"browserName=chrome,maxInstances=10,platform=ANY,seleniumProtocol=WebDriver"
 We think the way we are using our node (above) is 5 concurrent test sessions by default. Does each test have 20 browsers available to it ? Or does each test session share the 20 browsers (10 chrome/10 FF) in a pool - with the other test sessions ? Many thanks Christian

@TITLE:What's the convention for java package names without a domain association?
@CONTENT:I can't find a Q/A on SO that answers my exact question, so I figure I'd post it and see what comes back. As far as the naming convention goes for Java packages, I understand that it's supposed to be the reverse domain name: com.whatever.stuff and I get the rules about no mixed case, hyphens, keywords, etc. I've also read section 7.7 (Unique-Package-Names) of the Java Language Specification. As far as I can tell, the rules from Java are to use the reverse domain to insure uniqueness... and if you don't have one, go get one: You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domainname, such as sun.com. - Section 7.7 So if I'm not interested in shelling out the money for a domain name, I don't belong to a company whose name I can piggyback off of, is there any part of the naming convention that I'm missing that should be followed? I'm thinking I can just go name it whatever unique name I feel like at this point, but I was just wondering if I was missing anything. Note: I would like to release my package for other developers to use, so I didnt want to just do something that worked on my system, but something more standard if possible. I added the android tag because the java packages I'm going to be writing are going to be used in an Android application, wasn't sure if there were different opinions from android developers.

@CONTENT:I have a database that I built in SQLite browser, and it works fine. I launched an app with a prebuilt database and now I want to add more tables and data to that database. I can get the app to launch the onUpgrade method of the SQLiteOpenHelper. But the problem is, it's doing that EVERY time I use the helper. I have it localized to, only on app launch, seperating the upgrade command from the helper I used to retrieve data, but this is still a problem. I have figured it out though, as I have been using the same database on my computer (the one that I'm editing) since version 1. So, whenever it writes the newer database onto the SD card it's showing version 1 even though I should be up to version 4 by now. So, my question is, how can I manually edit the database version of the original database so that when it updates it isnt writing the old version number over the new one?

@TITLE:Javascript Regular Expression Remove Spaces
@CONTENT:So i'm writing a tiny little plugin for JQuery to remove spaces from a string. see here (function($) {
    $.stripSpaces = function(str) {
        var reg = new RegExp("[ ]+","g");
        return str.replace(reg,"");
    }
})(jQuery);
 my regular expression is currently [ ]+ to collect all spaces. This works.. however It doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth.. I also tried [\s]+ and [\W]+ but neither worked.. There has to be a better (more concise) way of searching for only spaces.
@CODE:(function($) {
    $.stripSpaces = function(str) {
        var reg = new RegExp("[ ]+","g");
        return str.replace(reg,"");
    }
})(jQuery); [ ]+ [\s]+ [\W]+

 My question is, instead of creating a new Fragment instance each time the user swipes left and right, how do I save a fragment's state (to some data structure) and then restore it? The API demo doesn't seem to have any state information saving code at all.
@CODE:public class FragmentPagerSupport extends FragmentActivity {

static final int NUM_ITEMS = 10;
MyAdapter mAdapter;
ViewPager mPager;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    mAdapter = new MyAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager());
    Log.i("Pager", "mAdapter = " + mAdapter.toString());

    mPager = (ViewPager)findViewById(R.id.pager);
    if (mPager == null)
        Log.i("Pager", "mPager = null");
    else 
        Log.i("Pager", "mPager = " + mPager.toString());

    Log.i("Pager", "Setting Pager Adapter");
    mPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);
}

public static class MyAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter {
    public MyAdapter(FragmentManager fm) {
        super(fm);
        Log.i("Pager", "MyAdapter constructor");
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() {
        Log.i("Pager", "MyAdapter.getCount()");
        return NUM_ITEMS;            
    }

    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int position) {
        Log.i("Pager", "MyAdapter.getItem()");

        return TestFragment.newInstance(position);
    }
}

public static class TestFragment extends Fragment {

    public static TestFragment newInstance(int position) {
        Log.i("Pager", "TestFragment.newInstance()");

        TestFragment fragment = new TestFragment();

        Bundle args = new Bundle();
        args.putInt("position", position);
        fragment.setArguments(args);

        return fragment;
    }
    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
            Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        Log.i("Pager", "TestFragment.onCreateView()");

        LinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout)inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_item, null);

@CONTENT:Within JSP files, I have some pretty complicated Javascript. On a production machine, we're seeing a very weird bug that we have not been able to understand. We have never been able to replicate it in a local or development environment. It might be related to the javascript, but I haven't found a good way to do this: use my browser to visit the page (on the production website) and then use browser tools to edit the javascript that runs on that page, including on reloads of the page. I'm always able to do this to tweak CSS etc, but as these questions point out, it's not obvious how to tweak JS client-side: Best way to capture javascript errors in production How to edit javascript in browser? How to edit javascript in firebug in Mozilla? How can I edit a js file sent by the server before it gets to my browser? How to replace Javascript of production website with local Javascript? with firefox w/firebug, how can I write javascript in the browser and use the .js file objects also? However, those answers don't help me because: "Execute JS" (Firefox addon) doesn't seem to work (doesn't do more than the console in Chrome already can do), "Charles" might work if I'd used separated js files, but my javascript is embedded in JSP It seems like How to modify javascript code on the fly in browser in debugging mode? is the closest thing to what I'm talking about, but that guy isn't able to talk about what he did because it was for his employer.

@LINK:/questions/6404881/custom-conversion-of-specific-objects-in-json-net
@TITLE:Custom conversion of specific objects in JSON.NET
@CONTENT:I'm using JSON.NET to serialize some of my objects, and i'd like to know if there is a simple way to override the default json.net converter only for a specific object? Currently I have the following class: public class ChannelContext : IDataContext
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<INewsItem> Items { get; set; }
}
 JSON.NET currently serializes the above like: {
    "Id": 2,
    "Name": "name value",
    "Items": [ item_data_here ]
}
 Is it possible just for that specific class to format it this way instead: "Id_2":
{
    "Name": "name value",
    "Items": [ item data here ]
}
 I'm kinda new to JSON.NET.. I was wondering if the above has something to do with writing a custom converter. I wasn't able to find any concrete examples on how to write one, If anyone can point me out to a specific source, I'll really appreciate it. I need to find a solution which makes that specific class always convert the same, because the above context is a part of an even bigger context which the JSON.NET default converter converts just fine. Hope my question is clear enough... UPDATE: I've found how to create a new custom converter (by creating a new class which inherits from JsonConverter and override it's abstract methods), I overriden the WriteJson method as follows: public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        ChannelContext contextObj = value as ChannelContext;

        writer.WriteStartObject();
        writer.WritePropertyName("id_" + contextObj.Id);
        writer.WriteStartObject();
        writer.WritePropertyName("Name");
        serializer.Serialize(writer, contextObj.Name);

        writer.WritePropertyName("Items");
        serializer.Serialize(writer, contextObj.Items);
        writer.WriteEndObject();
        writer.WriteEndObject();
    }
 This indeed does the job successfully, but... I'm intrigued if there's a way to serialize the rest of the object properties by reusing the default JsonSerializer (or converter for that matter) instead of manually "Writing" the object using the jsonwriter methods. UPDATE 2: I'm trying to get a more generic solution and came up with the following: public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        writer.WriteStartObject();

        // Write associative array field name
        writer.WritePropertyName(m_FieldNameResolver.ResolveFieldName(value));

        // Remove this converter from serializer converters collection
        serializer.Converters.Remove(this);

        // Serialize the object data using the rest of the converters
        serializer.Serialize(writer, value);

        writer.WriteEndObject();
    }
 This works fine when adding the converter manually to the serializer, like this: jsonSerializer.Converters.Add(new AssociativeArraysConverter<DefaultFieldNameResolver>());
jsonSerializer.Serialize(writer, channelContextObj);
 But doesn't work when using the [JsonConverter()] attribute set to my custom coverter above the ChannelContext class because of a self reference loop that occurs when executing: serializer.Serialize(writer, value)
 This is obviously because my custom converter is now considered the default converter for the class once it is set with the JsonConverterAttribute, so I get an inifinite loop. The only thing I can think of, in order to solve this problem is inheriting from a basic, jsonconverter class, and calling the base.serialize() method instead... But is such a JsonConverter class even exists? Thanks a lot! Mikey

@TITLE:Workaround for HttpContext.HideRequestResponse being internal? Detect if HttpContext.Request is really available?
@CONTENT:We're migrating an application to use IIS7 integrated mode. In library code that is designed to work either within the context of an HTTP request or not, we commonly have code like this: if (HttpContext.Current != null &&
    HttpContext.Current.Request != null) {

    // do something with HttpContext.Current.Request

} else {

    // do equivalent thing without HttpContext..

}
 But in IIS7 integrated mode the check for HttpContext.Current.Request throws an exception whenever this code is called from Application_Start. protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    SomeLibrary.DoSomethingWithHttpContextCurrentDetection();
}
 Results in: System.Web.HttpException: Request is not available in this context How can I detect whether the request is really available without wrapping these calls in an exception handler and taking action based on whether an exception is generated or not. Looking at HttpContext in Reflector I see it has an internal bool HideRequestResponse field but it's internal so I can only get to it with reflection and that's fragile. Is there a more official/approved way to determine if it's ok to call HttpContext.Request? This blog post about the subject says not to use HttpContext, but how, in generic library code, can you determine if it's ok to use HttpContext? http://mvolo.com/blogs/serverside/archive/2007/11/10/Integrated-mode-Request-is-not-available-in-this-context-in-Application_5F00_Start.aspx I'm using the work-around mentioned there which is to use Application_BeginRequest and an initialized field to only initialize once as part of BeginRequest, but that has to be done in every calling application whereas I'd prefer to make the library code more robust and handle this situation regardless of where it's called from.

Of course, I forgot to specify that column's type. The first thing I was thinking about doing was dropping that column and then re-adding it. However, it seems that sqlite does not have a simple way of doing this, and I would have had to backup the table and re-create it without the column. This seems messy, and I was wondering if there were just a way of modifying/adding a column's type. I would imagine so, but my searching around yielded no results, being new to sqlite, I imagine it was due to my wording being off in the query.

@TITLE:in general, should every table in a database have an identity field to use as a PK?
@CONTENT:This seems like a duplicate even as I ask it, but I searched and didn't find it. It seems like a good question for SO -- even though I'm sure I can find it on many blogs etc. out there. SO will have more of a debate than you can get on a blog. I'm running into an issue with a join: getting back too many records. I think of this as "expansion". I added a table to the set of joins and the number of rows expanded, way too much. Usually when this happens I add a select of all the ID fields that are involved in the join. That way it's pretty obvious where the expansion is happening and I can change the ON of the join to fix it. Except in this case, the table that I added doesn't have an ID field. To me, this is a problem. But perhaps I'm wrong. The question: should every table in a database have an IDENTITY field that's used as the PK? Are there any drawbacks to having an ID field in every table? What if you're reasonably sure this table will never be used in a PK/FK relationship? Related, but not duplicate: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/932913/when-having-an-identity-column-is-not-a-good-idea Apparently this debate has been going on for a while. Shoulda known.

@CONTENT:The Uri class defaults to RFC 2396. For OpenID and OAuth, I need Uri escaping consistent with RFC 3986. From the System.Uri class documentation: By default, any reserved characters in the URI are escaped in accordance with RFC 2396. This behavior changes if International Resource Identifiers or International Domain Name parsing is enabled in which case reserved characters in the URI are escaped in accordance with RFC 3986 and RFC 3987. The documentation also states that activating this IRI mode and thus the RFC 3986 behavior means adding a uri section element to machine.config and this to your app/web.config file: <configuration>
  <uri>
  <idn enabled="All" />
  <iriParsing enabled="true" />
  </uri>
</configuration>
 But whether this is present in the .config file or not, I'm getting the same (non-3986) escaping behavior for a .NET 3.5 SP1 app. What else do I need to do to get Uri.EscapeDataString to use the RFC 3986 rules? (specifically, to escape the reserved characters as defined in that RFC)

@TITLE:Angular Click outside of an element event
@CONTENT:I know there are many questions ask similar thing. But no one really solve my issue. I'm trying to build an directive which will execute an expression when mouse click outside the current element. Why I need this function? I'm building an app, in this app, there are 3 dropdown menu, 5 dropdown list(like chosen). All these are angular directives. Let's assume all these directives are different. So we have 8 directives. And all of them need a same function: when click out side the element, need hide the dropdown. I have 2 solutions for this, but both got issue: Solution A: app.directive('clickAnywhereButHere', function($document){
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    link: function(scope, elem, attr, ctrl) {
      elem.bind('click', function(e) {
        // this part keeps it from firing the click on the document.
        e.stopPropagation();
      });
      $document.bind('click', function() {
        // magic here.
        scope.$apply(attr.clickAnywhereButHere);
      })
    }
  }
})
 Here is an example for solution A: click here When you click the first dropdown, then working, then click second input, the first should hide but not. Solution B: app.directive('clickAnywhereButHere', ['$document', function ($document) {
    directiveDefinitionObject = {
        link: {
            pre: function (scope, element, attrs, controller) { },
            post: function (scope, element, attrs, controller) {
                onClick = function (event) {
                    var isChild = element.has(event.target).length > 0;
                    var isSelf = element[0] == event.target;
                    var isInside = isChild || isSelf;
                    if (!isInside) {
                        scope.$apply(attrs.clickAnywhereButHere)
                    }
                }
                $document.click(onClick)
            }
        }
    }
    return directiveDefinitionObject
}]);
 Here is example for solution B: click here Solution A working if there is just one directive in the page but not in my app. Because it's prevent bubbling, so first when I click on dropdown1, show dropdown1, then click on dropdown2, click event be prevent, so dropdown1 still showing there even I click outside the dropdown1. Solution B working in my app which I'm using now. But the issue is it's cause a performance issue. Too many click event be handled on every single click on anywhere in the app. In my current case, there are 8 click event bind with document, so every click execute 8 functions. Which cause my app very slow, especially in IE8. So is there any better solution for this? Thanks
@CODE:app.directive('clickAnywhereButHere', function($document){
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    link: function(scope, elem, attr, ctrl) {
      elem.bind('click', function(e) {

        e.stopPropagation();
      });
      $document.bind('click', function() {
        // magic here.
        scope.$apply(attr.clickAnywhereButHere);

@TITLE:Maintain keyboard open/closed state for EditText when app comes to foreground
@CONTENT:I have an Activity which is recreated on a config change (desired). I have a DialogFragment which calls setRetainInstance(true) with a single EditText in its layout. In the DialogFragment's onActivityCreated I call: getDialog().getWindow().setSoftInputMode(WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_VISIBLE);
 A) If I open the keyboard then when I put the app into the background and then bring it to the foregournd then I want the keyboard to still be displayed. B) If I close the keyboard (EditText still has focus and shows cursor which is desired behaviour) then I want the keyboard to still be closed if I put the app into the background and then bring it to the foreground. I can't seem to achieve both A) and B). The keyboard is always closed when I bring the app to the foreground. I've tried .SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE but then the keyboard is always open. Thanks in advance for any suggestions as to how I might achieve this. I also wish to maintain such keyboard state across rotation but I'm leaving that for another day. Peter. Edit Please note that I do not want to prevent the activity from being re-created on a configuration change. I also experimented with WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_UNCHANGED which did maintain the keyboard open/close state during rotation on a phone (single pane layout) but a) did not work with a dual pane layout b) did not maintain the keyboard state when bringing the app to the foreground.

@LINK:/questions/13521554/dom-level-3-xpath-in-internet-explorer
@TITLE:DOM Level 3 XPath in Internet Explorer
@CONTENT:I just installed IE10 on my Windows 7, and I've noticed that, even if I'm glad that XMLs from AJAX requests are now compatible DOM documents, a rather basic function like document.evaluate is still not supported. What's worse is that, since those XMLs are not the custom Microsoft IXMLDocument objects, the nodes don't support selectNodes and selectSingleNode anymore. In the end, it seems that IE10 does not support DOM Level 3 XPath or MSXML Xpath. Seriously, Microsoft? Is there something I'm missing? Sure, I can use querySelector and querySelectorAll, but I don't want to lose quite a bit of backward compatibility. Otherwise, one can still request a MSXML document using this line try {xhr.responseType = "msxml-document";} catch(e) {}
 as stated here, but I think it would be nice to deal with, at last, a standard DOM document in IE too. So, is there a way to use XPath in IE10 with standard DOM documents? UPDATE 26/7/2013 IE11 isn't stable yet, but it still doesn't support document.evaluate. If it won't support it in the stable release, I doubt it will ever support it. Needless to say this is ridicolous. I get that you can use querySelector/All in DOM nodes, but it's not supported in IE9 and lower, which are still quite commonly used, and anyway XPath is more powerful than selectors. Fortunately (if you can say that), you can still set xhr.responseType = "msxml-document". For a moment I feared you couldn't do that anymore... UPDATE 23/11/2013 IE11 is stable now but, sadly, it doesn't support document.evaluate. As heavy-weight XML documents are used less and less in web applications in favor of JSON or other light notation formats, this is becoming less of a problem, but still. Setting the responseType property still provides legacy XML documents, so nothing is lost I guess. I don't know if that will stay true for IE12, though. UPDATE 15/8/2015 Sounds ridiculous right now, but Edge now supports document.evaluate. Just when (almost) everything switched to JSON for data exchange. Well, better late than never, I guess.
@CODE:document.evaluate IXMLDocument selectNodes selectSingleNode querySelector querySelectorAll try {xhr.responseType = "msxml-document";} catch(e) {} document.evaluate querySelector All xhr.responseType = "msxml-document" document.evaluate responseType document.evaluate querySelector/All querySelector/All querySelector/All querySelector

I am getting feeds from vendors, so I thought to myself, "What if they pass how many are instock?" So I wondered if I inserted a number higher than 1 what would happen. I assumed it would default to 1. To my surprise it will allow me to hold any number up to 127, anything over defaults to 127. Can anyone explain why?

@TITLE:Is the async attribute/property useful if a script is dynamically added to the DOM?
@CONTENT:This question is sort of a tangent to Which browsers support <script async="async" />?. I've seen a few scripts lately that do something like this: var s = document.createElement('script');
s.type = 'text/javascript';
s.async = true;
s.src = 'http://www.example.com/script.js';
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);
 This is a common way to add a script to the DOM dynamically, which, IIRC from Steve Souders's book "Even Faster Web Sites," prompts all modern browsers to load the script asynchronously (i.e., not blocking page rendering or downloading of subsequent assets). If I'm correct in that, does the s.async = true statement have any use? Wouldn't it be redundant, even for the browser(s) that support that property, since dynamically appended a script should already trigger asynchronous downloading?
@CODE:var s = document.createElement('script');
s.type = 'text/javascript';
s.async = true;
s.src = 'http://www.example.com/script.js';
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s); s.async = true

@TITLE:Creating a Huge Dummy File in a Matter of Seconds in C#
@CONTENT:I want to create a huge dummy file say 1~2 GBs in matter of seconds. here is what I've written in C# : file.writeallbytes("filename",new byte[a huge number]);
 and another way with indicating the status, was like following : long FSS = din.TotalFreeSpace;
long segments = FSS / 10000;
long last_seg = FSS % 10000;
BinaryWriter br = new BinaryWriter(fs);

for (long i = 0; i < segments; i++)

    Application.DoEvents();
}
br.Write(new byte[last_seg]);
this.label2.Text += "\r\nDone!";
br.Close();
 where din is Disk Information object well with these two approach it takes something like 2 or more minutes to write such a big but dummy file. is there any other faster way for doing so? regards.

If I pass it the child view that is the image, then I get an image of that bitmap, and, unsurprisingly, none of its siblings (buttons).

@LINK:/questions/23815138/implementing-variadic-min-max-functions
@TITLE:Implementing variadic min / max functions
@CONTENT:I'm implementing variadic min/max functions. A goal is to take advantage of the compile time known number of arguments and perform an unrolled evaluation (avoid run-time loops). The current state of the code is as follows (presenting min - max is similar) #include <iostream>  

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
T vmin(T val1, T val2)
{
    return val1 < val2 ? val1 : val2;
}

template<typename T, typename... Ts>
T vmin(T val1, T val2, Ts&&... vs)
{
    return val1 < val2 ?
        vmin(val1, std::forward<Ts>(vs)...) : 
            vmin(val2, std::forward<Ts>(vs)...);
}

int main()
{
    cout << vmin(3, 2, 1, 2, 5) << endl;    
    cout << vmin(3., 1.2, 1.3, 2., 5.2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
 Now this works, but I have some questions / problems : The non variadic overload has to accept its arguments by value. If I try passing other types of ref I have the following results universal references && -> compilation error const references const& -> OK plain references & -> compilation error Now I know that function templates mix weirdly with templates but is there any specific know-how for the mix up at hand ? What type of arguments should I opt for? Wouldn't the expansion of the parameter pack by sufficient ? Do I really need to forward my arguments to the recursive call ? Is this functionallity better implemented when wrapped inside a struct and exposed as a static member function. Would the ability to partial specialize buy me anything ? Is there a more robust/efficient implementation/design for the function version ? (particullarly I'm wondering whether a constexpr version would be a match for the efficiency of template metaprogramming)
@CODE:#include <iostream>  

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
T vmin(T val1, T val2)
{
    return val1 < val2 ? val1 : val2;

    cout << vmin(3, 2, 1, 2, 5) << endl;    
    cout << vmin(3., 1.2, 1.3, 2., 5.2) << endl;

@TITLE:BackupManager Not Calling Backup Transport
@CONTENT:Alright, so I'm trying to implement Data Backup into my application, and have been following this guide. I've implemented my BackupAgentHelper using a SharedPreferencesBackupHelper. I don't get any errors, and I'm being sure to call dataChanged() after all preference changes, but when I test the backup (`adb shell bmgr run) I get this information in LogCat: 07-07 12:29:00.258: V/BackupManagerService(291): Scheduling immediate backup pass

07-07 12:29:00.297: I/PerformBackupTask(291): no backup data written; not calling transport
 So for reference, in my manifest I've added: <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:backupAgent="com.kcoppock.sudoku.SudokuBackupAgent"
 as well as <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.backup.api_key"
        android:value="my_key_goes_here" />
 and my BackupAgentHelper is implemented like so: public class SudokuBackupAgent extends BackupAgentHelper {
    static final String SCORES = "SCORES";
    static final String BACKUP_ID = "sudoku_backup";

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        SharedPreferencesBackupHelper backupHelper = 
                new SharedPreferencesBackupHelper(this, SCORES);
        addHelper(BACKUP_ID, backupHelper);
    }
}
 and finally, in my main activity, I call for a data backup like this: edit.putString(id + "_values", valueCache.toString());
edit.putString(id + "_hints", hintCache.toString());
edit.commit();
BackupManager backup = new BackupManager(this);
backup.dataChanged();
 I've tried debugging, and it seems my onCreate() in SudokuBackupAgent is never called. Or at least it's never reached from the debugger. It seems it isn't finding any updated data, and I have double checked to ENSURE there is data to be backed up. Is there something I'm missing here? EDIT: I should add, I'm testing on a device (Galaxy Nexus), and I've even tried using an exported release APK for testing purposes.

@LINK:/questions/8936549/constexpr-overloading
@TITLE:constexpr overloading
@CONTENT:Related: Probrem with constexpr - how to resolve it I feel like constexpr is limited in usefulness in C++11 because of the inability to define two functions that would otherwise have the same signature, but have one be constexpr and the other not constexpr. In other words, it would be very helpful if I could have, for example, a constexpr std::string constructor that takes constexpr arguments only, and a non-constexpr std::string constructor for non-constexpr arguments. Another example would be a theoretically complicated function that could be made more efficient by using state. You can't easily do that with a constexpr function, so you are left with two choices: have a constexpr function that is very slow if you pass in non-constexpr arguments, or give up on constexpr entirely (or write two separate functions, but you may not know which version to call). My question, therefore, is this: Is it possible for a standard-compliant C++11 implementation to allow function overloading based on the arguments being constexpr, or would this require updating the standard? If it is not allowed, was it intentionally not allowed? @NicolBolas: Say I have a function that maps an enum to a std::string. The most straight-forward way to do this, assuming my enum goes from 0 to n - 1, is to create an array of size n filled with the result. I could create a static constexpr char const * [] and construct a std::string on return (paying the cost of creating a std::string object every time I call the function), or I can create a static std::string const [] and return the value I look up, paying the cost of all of the std::string constructors the first time I call the function. It seems like a better solution would be to create the std::string in memory at compile time (similar to what is done now with char const *), but the only way to do this would be to alert the constructor that it has constexpr arguments. For a an example other than a std::string constructor, I think it's pretty straight-forward to find an example where, if you could ignore the requirements of constexpr (and thus create a non-constexpr function), you could create a more efficient function. Consider this thread: constexpr question, why do these two different programs run in such a different amount of time with g++? If I call fib with a constexpr argument, I can't beat do better than the compiler optimizing away the function call entirely. But if I call fib with a non-constexpr argument, I may want to have it call my own version that implements things like memoization (which would require state) so I get run time similar to what would have been my compile time had I passed a constexpr argument.
@CODE:enum std::string enum 0 n - 1 n static constexpr char const * [] std::string std::string static std::string const [] std::string std::string char const * constexpr std::string constexpr constexpr fib constexpr fib constexpr constexpr constexpr std::string We dont propose to make constexpr applicable to function arguments because it would be meaningless for non-inline functions (the argument would be a constant, but the function wouldnt know which) and because it would lead to complications of the overloading rules (can I overload on constexpr-ness? X no).

@CONTENT:During my study at university we started learning some of Java and in the second term we introduced to ASP.NET with VB.NET. After I finished my study I was looking on the Internet and found alot of comparisons between .net and PHP for web development but unfortunately you always encount people who are biased to the technology they use. Yesterday while I was walking to the marked I said to myself stop thinking about which one to use and pick one and start doing some good work. However, again I found myself want to choose the one that I can build and maintain websites quickly and easy and most importantly without much cost. ASP.NET with VB.NET or C# seems to be a great choice but the only major problem I see is the cost. I know that ASP.NET is free but what about the SQL Server database and the limitation of the express edition size? After thinking and thinking I said oh! I have stackoverflow, I will go there and ask you who have build medium-large applications using ASP.NET and who encounterd the cost of PHP and MySQL in their life in hosting their sites or their comapnies' sites. Now my question is: How much does it cost me to choose asp.net over PHP for a medium-large web application taking into acount hosting servers, unlimited database sizes, scalability issues improvements? I will care of cost in both money and effort that will be done.

@TITLE:Why does BCrypt.net GenerateSalt(31) return straight away?
@CONTENT:I stumbled across BCrypt.net after reading Jeff Atwood's post about storing passwords which led me to Thomas Ptacek's recommendation to use BCrypt to store passwords. Which finally led me to this C# implementation of BCrypt In the comments on the last link above someone asked "Why do GenerateSalt(30) take for ever, but GenerateSalt(31) seems to take no time at all?" I ran BCrypt.HashPassword(password, BCrypt.GenerateSalt(31)) and got my result in 0 milliseconds. I've been running BCrypt.HashPassword("password", BCrypt.GenerateSalt(30)) for over 5 minutes now and still do not have a result. I realize we'll probably not need a randomly generated 30 character salt to create our password hashes (or irreversible encryption in BCrypt's case) for years. EDIT I should have read the code a bit, logRounds doesn't have anything to do with the salt length. Thanks Aaronaught. So, why does GenerateSalt(31) return a value almost instantly (when it should take about twice as long as GenerateSalt(30)? UPDATE here is the fix: private byte[] CryptRaw(byte[] password, byte[] salt, int logRounds) {
    // ... snip ...
    uint rounds = 1U << logRounds;
    // ... snip
}
@CODE:private byte[] CryptRaw(byte[] password, byte[] salt, int logRounds) {
    // ... snip ...
    uint rounds = 1U << logRounds;
    // ... snip
}

@LINK:/questions/2201317/why-dont-current-websocket-client-implementations-support-proxies
@TITLE:Why don't current websocket client implementations support proxies?
@CONTENT:A Web Socket detects the presence of a proxy server and automatically sets up a tunnel to pass through the proxy. The tunnel is established by issuing an HTTP CONNECT statement to the proxy server, which requests for the proxy server to open a TCP/IP connection to a specific host and port. Once the tunnel is set up, communication can flow unimpeded through the proxy. Since HTTP/S works in a similar fashion, secure Web Sockets over SSL can leverage the same HTTP CONNECT technique. [1] OK, sounds useful! But, in the client implementations I've seen thus far (Go [2], Java [3]) I do not see anything related to proxy detection. Am I missing something or are these implementations just young? I know WebSockets is extremely new and client implementations may be equally young and immature. I just want to know if I'm missing something about proxy detection and handling.

@TITLE:How can I hide the jqgrid completely when no data returned?
@CONTENT:I'm having a heck of a time trying to only display my jqGrid when records are returned from my webservice. I don't want it to be collapsed to where you only see the caption bar either, but if that's the best I can do, I suppose that I could put a meaningful message into the caption. Still, I'd much rather just hide the grid and show a "No Records Found" message div block. I also guess that if worst came to worst, I could do the solution on this question How to display information in jqGrid that there are not any data? (link included as alternate possible solution for others). I've tried doing a .hide() inside of both the function used when loading the data from a function and the GRIDCOMPLETE event, and neither accomplished hiding the grid. I'm pretty new to JQuery, not to mention pretty new to using jqGrid. $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#list").jqGrid({

            { name: 'invdate', index: 'invdate', width: 90 },

 Edit: I agree that this example is very table-like and an actual table would be a fine choice. But my "real" page will eventually be less table-like, and I'd just like to first master this task! Also, for some reason, when I create/edit my posts in IE7, the code shows up correctly in the preview view, but when I actually post the message, the formatting gets removed. Editing my post in Firefox 2 seems to have worked, FWIW. Another edit: Yeah, I unaccepted GateKiller's answer. It does indeed work nicely on my simple page, but not in my actual heavier page. I'll investigate some of the links y'all have pointed me to.

@TITLE:Parse json in Swift, AnyObject type
@CONTENT:I'm trying to parse a json but I have some difficulties with the data types and notably the AnyObject type + downcasting. Let's consider the following json (it's an extract of a full json). {  "weather":
   [
      {
         "id":804,
         "main":"Clouds",
         "description":"overcast clouds",
         "icon":"04d"
      }
   ],
}
 To me, the json can be described as follow: json: Dictionary of type [String: AnyObject] (or NSDictionary, so = [NSObject, AnyObject] in Xcode 6 b3) "weather": Array of type [AnyObject] (or NSArray) Dictionary of type [String: AnyObject] (or NSDictionary, so = [NSObject, AnyObject] in Xcode 6 b3) My json is of type AnyObject! (I use JSONObjectWithData to get the json from a URL). I then want to access the weather Dictionary. Here is the code I wrote. var localError: NSError?
var json: AnyObject! = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions.MutableContainers, error: &localError)

if let dict = json as? [String: AnyObject] {
 if let weatherDictionary = dict["weather"] as? [AnyObject] {
      // Do stuff with the weatherDictionary
    }
}
 Here is the error I got Playground execution failed: error: <EXPR>:28:56: error: '[AnyObject]' is not a subtype of '(String, AnyObject)'
        if let weatherDictionary = dict["weather"] as? [AnyObject] {
 I don't understand why dict["weather"] is compared to a subtype of (String, AnyObject) and not AnyObject. I declared my dictionary as [String: AnyObject], so I i access a value using the String key, I should have an AnyObject, no? If I use NSDictionary instead of [String: AnyObject], it works. If I use NSArray instead of [AnyObject], it works. The Xcode 6 beta 3 release notes tell that "NSDictionary* is now imported from Objective-C APIs as [NSObject : AnyObject].". And the Swift book: "When you bridge from an NSArray object to a Swift array, the resulting array is of type [AnyObject]." EDIT I forgot to force unwrapping the dict["weather"]!. if let dict = json as? [String: AnyObject] {
    println(dict)
       if let weatherDictionary = dict["weather"]! as? [AnyObject] {
            println("\nWeather dictionary:\n\n\(weatherDictionary)")
            if let descriptionString = weatherDictionary[0]["description"]! as? String {
                println("\nDescription of the weather is: \(descriptionString)")
        }
    }
}
 Note that we should double check for the existence of the first Optional. if let dict = json as? [String: AnyObject] {
    for key in ["weather", "traffic"] {
        if let dictValue = dict[key] {
            if let subArray = dictValue as? [AnyObject] {
                println(subArray[0])
            }
        } else {
            println("Key '\(key)' not found")
        }
    }
}

@TITLE:Windows Phone 8 IE10 Javascript debugging
@CONTENT:IE10 has some wonderful enhancements in the HTML5 compliance area but remains a bear to develop JavaScript HTML5 when running on the WP8 as there is no way to debug the app except console messages. Is there a remote debugging experience available for IE10 running on WP8 like the WebKit phone browsers have(see my video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNAjzFpNEj4 for example). When this is in place with a USB cable to desktop Safari debugging Javascript apps on IOS is easy as breakpoints can be set and variables examined in the remote debugger . I am hoping the same capabilities are in IE10 and would appreciate any information on where to enable these very much needed capabilities.

@TITLE:No property found for type error when try to create custom repository with Spring Data JPA
@CONTENT:I have a Media entity that has some basic fields for files uploaded by the user. For saving the bytes of the files uploaded, I want to create a custom repository that holds that functionality. Following the steps in the Spring documentation, I've created an interface that looks like this: public interface MediaBytesRepository
{
    public byte[] getBytes(Media media) throws IOException;
    public void saveBytes(Media media, byte[] bytes) throws IOException;
    public void appendBytes(Media media, byte[] bytes) throws IOException;
    public void deleteBytes(Media media) throws IOException;
    public boolean bytesExist(Media media) throws IOException;
}
 Then I provided an implementation for this interface called MediaBytesRepositoryImpl With this, I then created the following interface: public interface MediaRepository extends JpaRepository<Media, Long>, MediaBytesRepository
{
}
 Now, when I start up the server, I get the following stack trace: SEVERE: Exception sending context initialized event to listener instance of class org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener

To implement findContours(gray, contours, CV_RETR_LIST, CV_CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE); in java i used this syntax Imgproc.findContours(gray, contours, new Mat(), Imgproc.RETR_LIST, Imgproc.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE);. So now contours should be List<MatOfPoint> contours = new ArrayList<MatOfPoint>(); rather than vector<vector<cv::Point> > contours;. Then i need implement this approxPolyDP(Mat(contours[i]), approx, arcLength(Mat(contours[i]), true)*0.02, true);. In java api, Imgproc.approxPolyDP accept argument as approxPolyDP(MatOfPoint2f curve, MatOfPoint2f approxCurve, double epsilon, boolean closed). How i can i convert MatOfPoint to MatOfPoint2f? Or is there a way to use vectors as same as c++ interface to implement this. Any suggestion or sample code is greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:plotting pie graphs on map in ggplot
@CONTENT:This may be a wish list thing, not sure (i.e. maybe there would need to be the creation of geom_pie for this to occur). I saw a map today (LINK) with pie graphs on it as seen here. I don't want to debate the merits of a pie graph, this was more of an exercise of can I do this in ggplot? I have provided a data set below (loaded from my drop box) that has the mapping data to make a New York State map and some purely fabricated data on racial percentages by county. I have given this racial make up as a merge with the main data set and as a separate data set called key. I also think Bryan Goodrich's response to me in another post (HERE) on centering county names will be helpful to this concept. How can we make the map above with ggplot2? A data set and the map without the pie graphs: load(url("http://dl.dropbox.com/u/61803503/nycounty.RData"))
head(ny); head(key)  #view the data set from my drop box
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ny, aes(long, lat, group=group)) +  geom_polygon(colour='black', fill=NA)

#  Now how can we plot a pie chart of race on each county 
#  (sizing of the pie would also be controllable via a size 
#  parameter like other `geom_` functions).
 Thanks in advance for your ideas. EDIT: I just saw another case at junkcharts that screams for this type of capability:
@CODE:geom_pie load(url("http://dl.dropbox.com/u/61803503/nycounty.RData"))
head(ny); head(key)  #view the data set from my drop box

I have used Median filter to accomplish it but in that case connection bridge between coins grows and it goes impossible to recognize them after several times of erosion... So I need a simple floodFill like method in opencv Here is my image with holes: EDIT: floodfill like function must fill holes in big components without prompting X,Y coordinates as a seed... EDIT: I tried to use cvDrawContours function but I doesn't fill contours inside bigger ones. Here is my code:         CvMemStorage mem = cvCreateMemStorage(0);
        CvSeq contours = new CvSeq();
        CvSeq ptr = new CvSeq();
        int sizeofCvContour = Loader.sizeof(CvContour.class);

        cvThreshold(gray, gray, 150, 255, CV_THRESH_BINARY_INV);

        int numOfContours = cvFindContours(gray, mem, contours, sizeofCvContour, CV_RETR_CCOMP, CV_CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE);
        System.out.println("The num of contours: "+numOfContours); //prints 87, ok

        Random rand = new Random();
        for (ptr = contours; ptr != null; ptr = ptr.h_next()) {
            Color randomColor = new Color(rand.nextFloat(), rand.nextFloat(), rand.nextFloat());
            CvScalar color = CV_RGB( randomColor.getRed(), randomColor.getGreen(), randomColor.getBlue());
            cvDrawContours(gray, ptr, color, color, -1, CV_FILLED, 8);
        }
        CanvasFrame canvas6  = new CanvasFrame("drawContours");
        canvas6.showImage(gray);
 Result: (you can see black holes inside each coin)
@CODE:CvMemStorage mem = cvCreateMemStorage(0);
        CvSeq contours = new CvSeq();
        CvSeq ptr = new CvSeq();
        int sizeofCvContour = Loader.sizeof(CvContour.class);

        cvThreshold(gray, gray, 150, 255, CV_THRESH_BINARY_INV);

@TITLE:UIScrollView prevents touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded on view controller
@CONTENT:I am handling touches for a couple of my UI components in my view controller (custom subclass of UIViewController). It has methods touchesBegan:withEvent:, touchesMoved:withEvent:, and touchesEnded:withEvent:. It was working fine. Then I added a scroll view (UIScrollView) as the top view in the hierarchy. Now my touch handlers on the view controller don't work. They don't get called. The interesting thing is, I have various other UI components within the scroll view that do work. Some are buttons, some are custom views that define their own touchesBegan:withEvent:, etc. The only thing that doesn't work is the touch handlers on the view controller. I thought maybe it's because the scroll view is intercepting those touches for its own purposes, but I subclassed UIScrollView and just to see if I could get it to work I am returning YES always from touchesShouldBegin:withEvent:inContentView: and NO always from touchesShouldCancelInContentView:. Still doesn't work. If it makes a difference my view controller is within a tab bar controller, but I don't think it's relevant. Has anyone had this problem and have a ready solution? My guess is the scroll view monkeys up the responder chain. Can I monkey it back? I guess if I can't figure anything else out I'll make the top level view under my scroll view be a custom view and forward the messages on to the view controller, but seems kludgy.

@TITLE:What are PostgreSQL RULEs good for?
@CONTENT:Question I often see it stated that rules should be avoided and triggers used instead. I can see the danger in the rule system, but certainly there are valid uses for rules, right? What are they? I'm asking this out of general interest; I'm not very seasoned with databases. Example of what might be a valid use For instance, in the past I've needed to lock down certain data, so I've done something like this: CREATE OR REPLACE RULE protect_data AS
  ON UPDATE TO exampletable             -- another similar rule for DELETE
  WHERE OLD.type = 'protected'
  DO INSTEAD NOTHING;
 Then if I want to edit the protected data: START TRANSACTION;
  ALTER TABLE exampletable DISABLE RULE protect_data;
  -- edit data as I like
  ALTER TABLE exampletable ENABLE RULE protect_data;
COMMIT;
 I agree this is hacky, but I couldn't change the application(s) accessing the database in this case (or even throw errors at it). So bonus points for finding a reason why this is a dangerous/invalid use of the rule system, but not for why this is bad design.

@LINK:/questions/5052102/communication-between-local-jvms
@TITLE:Communication between local JVMs
@CONTENT:My question: What approach could/should I take to communicate between two or more JVM instances that are running locally? Some description of the problem: I am developing a system for a project that requires separate JVM instances to isolate certain tasks from each other entirely. In it's running, the 'parent' JVM will create 'child' JVMs that it will expect to execute and then return results to it (in the format of relatively simple POJO classes, or perhaps structured XML data). These results should not be transferred using the SysErr/SysOut/SysIn pipes as the child may already use these as part of its running. If a child JVM does not respond with results within a certain time, the parent JVM should be able to signal to the child to cease processing, or to kill the child process. Otherwise, the child JVM should exit normally at the end of completing its task. Research so far: I am aware there are a number of technologies that may be of use e.g.... Using Java's RMI library Using sockets to transfer objects Using distribution libraries such as Cajo, Hessian ...but am interested in hearing what approaches others may consider before pursuing one of these options, or any others. Thanks for any help or advice on this! Edits: Quantity of data to transfer- relatively small, it will mostly be just a handful of POJOs containing strings that will represent the result of the child executing. If any solution would be inefficient on larger amounts of information, this is unlikely to be a problem in my system. The amount being transferred should be pretty static and so this does not have to be scalable. Latency of transfer- not a critical concern in this case, although if any 'polling' of results is needed this should be able to be fairly frequent without significant overheads, so I can maintain a responsive GUI on top of this at a later time (e.g. progress bar)

@TITLE:Printing on roll paper
@CONTENT:I am using C# with Winforms. I am trying to print bills on a paper roll. The width of the paper is 3in but the length of the paper is dynamic (its a roll paper). The length depends on how many items are there in the list. E.g. in a purchase if there are 100 items sold then it will be quite long roll while for a single item purchased it would be of small length. When I print the report, after the end job, printer eject the last page more than I need. It eject paper as long as A4 size. I want to print the required lines, then stop printing. I use a roll of paper, not A4 or A3 and an Epson LQ-300 + II printer. To be more specific, printing is always done to page-sized units. If I set the page to be 3in x 8in then I always end up with a printout that is a multiple of 8in long. If I have a 9in bill to print, I end up with a 16in printout, wasting 7in of paper. How can I print with the last page being only as long as it needs to be? Here is the code: private void printDoc_PrintPage(Object sender, PrintPageEventArgs e)
        {
            Font printFont = new Font("Courier New", 12);
            int y = 15;

 New to Android development, and having googled around, I understand that this is the way to do stuff without blocking the main (UI) thread, while still setting the image on the UI thread after decoding. (at least according to android-developers) (which I have verified by logging Thread.currentThread().getName() at various places) Now sometimes the image just doesn't show up, and stdout only says I/System.out( 8066): bitmap: android.graphics.Bitmap@432f3ee8 img: android.widget.ImageView@4339d698
I/System.out( 8066): runnable posted
 with not a trace of the messages from the Runnable. So appearantly the Runnable doesn't run(), although img.post() returns true. Pulling the ImageView in onCreate() and declaring it final doesn't help. I'm clueless. Simply setting the bitmap directly, while blocking the UI thread, does fix things, but I want to get things right. Does anybody understand what's going on here? (ps. this was all observed on an Android 1.6 phone and android-3 sdk)

@CONTENT:I'm working on a project that is based on an old project someone started and didn't finish. I was trying to use as much of their code as I could, so in doing so I ran into some tweaking issues. Namely, when I put some of the old xaml in the new project there were some errors that were thrown regarding the "x:static" property and "Dynamic property." here are the error messages themselves: Error 1: The type 'DynamicResource' was not found. Verify that you are not missing an assembly reference and that all referenced assemblies have been built. Error 2: The type 'x:Static' was not found. Verify that you are not missing an assembly reference and that all referenced assemblies have been built. Some notable points that I think is causing the errors: the old project was programmed in VS2008, WPF, v3.5 .Net framework; whereas I am programming in VS2010, Silverlight 4, .Net framework v4.0. I realize there are differences from WPF to Silverlight as far as xaml goes and there are plenty of differences from the different .Net framework versions and editions of Visual Studio. But I just can't seem to find a fix for this anywhere so I didn't know if there was just a library I was missing or just something I'm simply overlooking or what. I can recreate this if need be, but like I said, I'd rather use as much of the old code as I can as long as the tweaking doesn't cause more trouble than what it's worth.

@CONTENT:What is the most efficient way to port an iPhone app to Android? I know Apple doesn't like 3rd-party, non-Objective C platforms generating code for their platform ... but is there something out there that can take an iPhone app and convert it to Android friendly code? If not, how have folks out there been creating Android versions of their existing iPhone apps? Thanks

@TITLE:Creating T4 templates at runtime (build-time)?
@CONTENT:We are building an inhouse application which needs to generate HTML files for upload into eBay listings. We are looking to use a template engine to generate the HTML files based on database and static fields that we have pre-defined. The template also needs to have logic capabilities (if-then, foreach, etc). We have looked at T4 and it looks perfect, but we don't see anything about whether it has the capabilities to be used at runtime, so that a user can create the T4 template, and then the application can "compile" it and generate the final HTML file. Is this possible, and how? If not, are there other frameworks we should be looking at that has all these capabilities?

@TITLE:How to migrate ugly and undocumented VB6 Code to .NET
@CONTENT:I know that there are already Questions about VB6 migration, but the code base of my project brings some new questions here. I have to say the Code quality, structure and architecture is just a nightmare. There are 2 Big Projects: Nr.1 with 40 Forms, 40 Modules and a few class files, this EXE is kind of a "base system". Nr.2 with 80 Forms, 20 Modules and a few class files again, this EXE calls functions form the "base system". Then there are ~10 other Projects with GUI (1-3 Forms each) and another 90 non-GUI Projects, most of them EXE Files, some DLLs. The DLLs are written in C, C++ and VB6. The Code has grown evolutionary since 10 years, and written mostly by 1 (bad) developer at a time. Functions with 500 Lines (and more) are very common. 90% of the GUI components are named text1, command2(1), K copy and paste is all over the place e. g. an EXE project (without GUI) with 5000 lines of code was copied and the only change in the copy was to send files per Mail instead of FTP (there are 2 further copies of the same project also). I once had a small form (15 fields), where I should solve a small problem(max. a half hour thing normally), every time I changed something, it either didn't work, or produced new errors in the form. After 2 days, I decided to rewrite the form completely and from ~20 SQL statements in the old form, only 2 survived in the new one. don't even ask about comments in the code K I took over the project a few months ago and I'm the only maintainer. There is a constant, (but low) flow of Change Requests and errors and we get a maintenance budget from our customers to keep the software running and "up to date" in terms of legal requirements. My Options 1) Rewrite from scratch - In that case I could write it in Java for portability. The problem here is that besides some (old) user help, there is no documentation, so the ugly code is the "documentation". There is one Person who has the high level know how what the software should do. Also it's hard to convince management about doing it, even if there are huge cost savings in the long term, there are political issues. I also can't do that one (vb) project at a time because the database structure is no better than the code i.e. has to done from scratch too. So I can only change the whole software at once. 2) Migrate the code to VB.NET / C# Migration of the main Projects first, I tested that already and got ~2000 upgrade comments from Project Nr.1, most of them things like Screen.MousePointer changed, functions with variant return values and so on. My Idea here is after the convert, create classes for DB abstraction, change the code to use these classes and do refactoring, migrate and change the other projects too and when all the code uses the DB classes, change the DB structure. 3) Refactor the code in VB6 whenever I have to change something there anyway (I'm already doing this partly) and at some point refactor also the rest. That way it's more easy to see the original functionality, because it's original code and when there are errors, it's obvious that they can't be results of the migration. When the code is refactored (I assume it will be 50-75% smaller then also) it's easier to migrate it to .NET. Then change DB structure (and then do another round of refactoringK). There are some bigger changes to do in the future (make it compatible with Win7, and another big CR which affects big parts of the code), so there would be a good opportunity to do these changes, as I'll have to go through lot's of the code anyway. My Question is who has experience / hints for migrating bad, ugly code? Which options would you suggest?

@LINK:/questions/2039902/how-does-rubys-sort-by-rand-work
@TITLE:How does Ruby's sort_by {rand} work?
@CONTENT:I think this is a great Ruby one-liner: someArray.sort_by {rand}
 It's concise, it's readable, and it works - but I don't quite understand how. Here's what I know: rand evaluates to a number between 0 and 1 (like 0.783468632804653) rand is being repeatedly evaluated in the code above, because assigning it to x first breaks the random sort sort_by {0.783468632804653}, or any other number I tried, has no effect on the array ruby-doc.org wasn't much help to me in this case. Can someone explain this step-by-step? Update I've been using Ruby longer now, and I see that I was missing a concept or two here. The key thing is that: rand is a method (defined on Kernel); it generates a random number {rand} is a block, which sort_by keeps, calling it each time it wants to compare two items in the collection. If the collection is a bunch of objects representing countries, it needs to be able to grab two of them and determine which one comes first. Do you put the one with the longest name first? The one with the largest land mass? The block should answer that question by returning a value that says "you asked about Spain vs Cameroon, and I say Cameroon comes first." (You could do that with {|country| country.name.length} The rest of how sort_by works is explained in the documentation. I'm still not quite sure why returning a random number works at all - presumably sort_by rounds it to -1, 0, or 1, whichever is closest? But in any case, getting a different random number every time you call the block is quite different from getting the same number every time. When sort_by says "which of these two countries comes first?", {rand} puts on a blindfold, turns around 10 times, points and says "that one!" :)
@CODE:someArray.sort_by {rand} rand rand x sort_by {0.783468632804653} rand {rand} sort_by {|country| country.name.length} sort_by sort_by sort_by {rand} someArray.shuffle shuffle

@TITLE:What is the right way to override the copy/deepcopy operations on an object in Python?
@CONTENT:So just to establish, I feel like I understand the difference between copy vs. deepcopy in the copy module and I've used copy.copy and copy.deepcopy before successfully, but this is the first time I've actually gone about overloading the __copy__ and __deepcopy__ methods. I've already Googled around and looked through the built-in Python modules to look for instances of the __copy__ and __deepcopy__ functions (e.g. sets.py, decimal.py, and fractions.py), but I'm still not 100% sure I've got it right. Here's my scenario: I have a configuration object that mostly just consists of simple properties (though it will potentially have lists of other non-primitive objects in it). Initially I'm going to instantiate one configuration object with a default set of values. This configuration will be handed off to multiple other objects (to ensure all objects start with the same configuration). Once user interaction starts, however, each object will need to be able to tweak the configurations independently without affecting each other's configurations (which says to me I'll need to make deepcopys of my initial configuration to hand around). Here's a sample object: class ChartConfig(object):

    def __init__(self):

        #Drawing properties (Booleans/strings)
        self.antialiased = None
        self.plot_style = None
        self.plot_title = None
        self.autoscale = None

        #X axis properties (strings/ints)
        self.xaxis_title = None
        self.xaxis_tick_rotation = None
        self.xaxis_tick_align = None

        #Y axis properties (strings/ints)
        self.yaxis_title = None
        self.yaxis_tick_rotation = None
        self.yaxis_tick_align = None

        #A list of non-primitive objects
        self.trace_configs = []

    def __copy__(self):
        pass

    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        pass
 What is the right way to implement the copy and deepcopy methods on this object to ensure copy.copy and copy.deepcopy give me the proper behavior? I'm currently using Python 2.6.2. Thanks in advance!

@TITLE:Two Way Data Binding With a Dictionary in WPF
@CONTENT:I'd like to bind a Dictionary<string, int> to a ListView in WPF. I'd like to do this in such a way that the Values in the Dictionary get updated via the data binding mechanism. I don't want to change the Keys just the Values. I also don't care about adding new mappings to the Dictionary. I just want to update existing ones. Setting the Dictionary as the ItemsSource of the ListView doesn't accomplish this. It doesn't work because the ListView uses the Enumerator to access the contents of the Dictionary and the elements of that enumeration are immutable KeyValuePair objects. My current line of investigation attempts to use the Keys property. I assign this to the ItemsSource property of my ListView. This does allow me to display the Keys but I don't know enough about WPF's databinding mechanism to access the Values in the Dictionary. I found this question: Access codebehind variable in XAML but still can't seem to bridge the gap. Do any of you know how to make this approach work? Does anyone have a better approach? It seems like, as a last resort, I could build a custom object and stick it in a List from which I recreate/update my Dictionary but this seems like a way to circumvent the built-in data binding functionality rather than effectively utilize it.

                    _database = _cacheService.GetDatabase(database);
                }

        }

    }

    public void Set(string key, object data, TimeSpan? expiry = null)
    {
        if (_database != null)
        {
            _database.Set(key, data, expiry: expiry);

        }

    }
 Performing very simple commands like Get and Set often time out or take 5-10 seconds to complete. Seems like it kind of negates the whole purpose of using it as a cache if it's WAY slower than actually fetching the real data from my database :) Am I doing anything obviously incorrect?

@TITLE:22 fields limit in Scala 2.11 + Play Framework 2.3 Case classes and functions
@CONTENT:Scala 2.11 is out and the 22 fields limit for case classes seems to be fixed (Scala Issue, Release Notes). This has been an issue for me for a while because I use case classes to model database entities that have more than 22 fields in Play + Postgres Async. My solution in Scala 2.10 was to break the models into multiple case classes, but I find this solution hard to maintain and extend, and I was hoping I could implement something as described below after switching to Play 2.3.0-RC1 + Scala 2.11.0: package entities

case class MyDbEntity(
  id: String,
  field1: String,
  field2: Boolean,
  field3: String,
  field4: String,
  field5: String,
  field6: String,
  field7: String,
  field8: String,
  field9: String,
  field10: String,
  field11: String,
  field12: String,
  field13: String,
  field14: String,
  field15: String,
  field16: String,
  field17: String,
  field18: String,
  field19: String,
  field20: String,
  field21: String,
  field22: String,
  field23: String,
) 

object MyDbEntity {
  import play.api.libs.json.Json
  import play.api.data._
  import play.api.data.Forms._

  implicit val entityReads = Json.reads[MyDbEntity]
  implicit val entityWrites = Json.writes[MyDbEntity]
}
 The code above fails to compile with the following message for both the "Reads" and the "Writes": No unapply function found Updating the "Reads" and "Writes" to:   implicit val entityReads: Reads[MyDbEntity] = (
    (__ \ "id").read[Long] and
    (__ \ "field_1").read[String]
    ........
  )(MyDbEntity.apply _)  

  implicit val postWrites: Writes[MyDbEntity] = (
    (__ \ "id").write[Long] and
    (__ \ "user").write[String]
    ........
  )(unlift(MyDbEntity.unapply))
 Also doesn't work:   implementation restricts functions to 22 parameters

  value unapply is not a member of object models.MyDbEntity
 My understanding is that Scala 2.11 still has some limitations on functions and that something like what I described above is not possible yet. This seems weird to me as I don't see the benefit of lifting the restrictions on case classes if one it's major users cases is still not supported, so I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Pointers to issues or implementation details are more than welcome! Thanks!

@TITLE:Tab bar background is missing on iOS 7.1 after presenting and dismissing a view controller
@CONTENT:I've tried my app on iOS 7.1 and I found that the tab bar background disappears on a few occasions. I was able to track them down; it happens when: pushing a view controller placed inside navigation controller (that is inside tab bar controller) with hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES presenting a view controller and then dismissing it (i.e. the MFMailComposeViewController) I've created a sample app (used the tab bar template + added button to display the view controller, and a mapView to be able to tell if the bar disappeared), and the issue is there. Here is all the code for the sample app that I changed: #import "FirstViewController.h"

@import MessageUI;

@interface FirstViewController () <MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate>

@end

@implementation FirstViewController

- (IBAction)presentVCButtonPressed:(id)sender {
    if ([MFMailComposeViewController canSendMail]) {

        MFMailComposeViewController *mailer = [[MFMailComposeViewController alloc] init];
        mailer.mailComposeDelegate = self;
        [mailer setSubject:@"Feedback for Routie"];
        [mailer setToRecipients:@[@"support@routieapp.com"]];
        [self presentViewController:mailer animated:YES completion:nil];
    }
}

- (void)mailComposeController:(MFMailComposeViewController *)controller didFinishWithResult:(MFMailComposeResult)result error:(NSError *)error {
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}

@end
 Here you can download the whole sample project. Now, important thing: this seems not to affect iPhone 5, nor the simulator. The problem is on iPhone 4 and iPod Touch (last generation as of writing this post). Does any of you have the same problem? Were you able to fix it? Thanks! Update: I found a workaround. See my answer below.
@CODE:hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES MFMailComposeViewController #import "FirstViewController.h"

@import MessageUI;

@interface FirstViewController () <MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate>

@end

@implementation FirstViewController

- (IBAction)presentVCButtonPressed:(id)sender {
    if ([MFMailComposeViewController canSendMail]) {

        MFMailComposeViewController *mailer = [[MFMailComposeViewController alloc] init];
        mailer.mailComposeDelegate = self;
        [mailer setSubject:@"Feedback for Routie"];
        [mailer setToRecipients:@[@"support@routieapp.com"]];
        [self presentViewController:mailer animated:YES completion:nil];
    }

@TITLE:How to not-analyze in ElasticSearch?
@CONTENT:I've got a field in an ElasticSearch field which I do not want to have analyzed, i. e. it should be stored and compared verbatim. The values will contain letters, numbers, whitespace, dashes, slashes and maybe other characters. If I do not give an analyzer in my mapping for this field, the default still uses a tokenizer which hacks my verbatim string into chunks of words. I don't want that. Is there a super simple analyzer which, basically, does not analyze? Or is there a different way of denoting that this field shall not be analyzed? I only create the index, I don't do anything else. I can use analyzers like "english" for other fields which seems to be built-in names for pre-configured analyzers. Is there a list of other names? Maybe there's one fitting my needs (namely doing nothing with the input). This is my mapping currently: {
  "my_type": {
    "properties": {
      "my_field1": { "type": "string", "analyzer": "english" },
      "my_field2": { "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
 my_field1 is language-dependent; this seems to work. my_field2 shall be verbatim. I'd like to give an analyzer there which simply does not do anything. A sample value for my_field2 would be "B45c 14/04".
@CODE:{
  "my_type": {
    "properties": {
      "my_field1": { "type": "string", "analyzer": "english" },

@LINK:/questions/15745394/can-phantomjs-work-with-node-js
@TITLE:can phantomjs work with node.js?
@CONTENT:I would like to use phantomjs in my node.js script. there is a phantomjs-node library.. but unfortunately the author used this weird coffee script code to explain what he's doing: phantom = require 'phantom'

phantom.create (ph) ->
  ph.createPage (page) ->
    page.open "http://www.google.com", (status) ->
      console.log "opened google? ", status
      page.evaluate (-> document.title), (result) ->
        console.log 'Page title is ' + result
        ph.exit()
 now if I were to use phantomjs directly with javascript, it would look something like this: var page = require('webpage').create();
page.open(url, function (status) {
    var title = page.evaluate(function () {
        return document.title;
    });
    console.log('Page title is ' + title);
});
 so basically I'm trying to write up the equivalent of the first snippet of code above in normal javascript (by reading the coffee script documentation.. this is what I did: // file name: phantomTest.js

var phantom = require('phantom');

phantom.create(function(ph) {
    ph.createPage(function(page) {
        page.open('http://www.google.com', function(status) {
            console.log('opened google?', status);
            var title = page.evaluate(function() {
                return document.title;
            });
            console.log('page title is ' + title);              
        });
    });
    ph.exit();
});
 unfortunately it's not working! If I run node phantomTest.js
 on the shell, nothing happens.. nothing returns and the process doesn't stop.. any ideas? update: I just read this in the phantomjs faq: Q: Why is PhantomJS not written as Node.js module? A: The short answer: "No one can serve two masters." A longer explanation is as follows. As of now, it is technically very challenging to do so. Every Node.js module is essentially "a slave" to the core of Node.js, i.e. "the master". In its current state, PhantomJS (and its included WebKit) needs to have the full control (in a synchronous matter) over everything: event loop, network stack, and JavaScript execution. If the intention is just about using PhantomJS right from a script running within Node.js, such a "loose binding" can be achieved by launching a PhantomJS process and interact with it. mmm.. could this have something to do with it? but then that whole library wouldn't make sense! update 2: I found this code in the web that does the same thing: var phantom = require('phantom');
phantom.create(function(ph) {
  return ph.createPage(function(page) {
    return page.open("http://www.google.com", function(status) {
      console.log("opened google? ", status);
      return page.evaluate((function() {
        return document.title;
      }), function(result) {
        console.log('Page title is ' + result);

@TITLE:Running UIAutomation scripts from Xcode
@CONTENT:Did anyone succeed in setting up automated UIAutomation tests in Xcode? I'm trying to set up a target in my Xcode project that should run all the UIAutomation scripts I prepared. Currently, the only Build Phase of this target is this Run Script block: TEMPLATE="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns/AutomationInstrument.bundle/Contents/Resources/Automation.tracetemplate"
MY_APP="/Users/Me/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.0/Applications/564ED15A-A435-422B-82C4-5AE7DBBC27DD/MyApp.app"

SCRIPT="/Users/Me/Projects/MyApp/Tests/UI/SomeTest.js"
instruments -t $TEMPLATE $MY_APP -e UIASCRIPT $SCRIPT -e UIARESULTSPATH $RESULTS
 When I build this target it succeeds after a few seconds, but the script didn't actually run. In the build log I get these errors: instruments[7222:707] Failed to load Mobile Device Locator plugin
instruments[7222:707] Failed to load Simulator Local Device Locator plugin
instruments[7222:707] Automation Instrument ran into an exception while trying to run the script.  UIATargetHasGoneAWOLException
+0000 Fail: An error occurred while trying to run the script.
Instruments Trace Complete (Duration : 1.077379s; Output : /Users/Me/Projects/MyApp/Tests/UI/Traces/Automation.trace)
 I am pretty sure, that my javascript and my run script are both correct, because if I run the exact same instruments command in bash it works as expected. Could this be a bug in Xcode?

@LINK:/questions/13210638/hibernate-delete-query
@TITLE:Hibernate Delete query
@CONTENT:When I try to delete an entry from a db, using session.delete(object) 
 then I can the following: 1) If the row is present in DB then two SQL queries are getting executed: A select and then a delete 2) If the row is not present in the DB then only the select query is getting executed But again this is not the case for update. Irrespective of the presence of DB row, only the update query is getting executed. Please let me know why this kind of behaviour for delete operation. Isn't it a performance issue since two queries are getting hit rather than one? Edit: I am using hibernate 3.2.5 Sample code: SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure("student.cfg.xml").buildSessionFactory();
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();

 Idea of above project structure is that we have multiple projects which contains subprojects, each project can have dependencies to other projects. Also subprojects inside the project can have dependencies to other subprojects within the same project. Projects will be specified in the settings.gradle in the root. Also settings.gradle inside each project will say what are the subprojects of that particular project. My settings.gradle in the root would looks like include 'Project1',
         'Project2'
 and Project1 settings.gradle will looks like include 'SubProject11'
         'SubProject12'
 other depndecy orders are defined in the respective build.gradle files If I rand gradle clean build install inside the root location(Standar location) it doesn't seems to use configurations in the Project level settings.gradle file. What I'm doing here wrong?

@TITLE:Correct way to keep pooled connections alive (or time them out and get fresh ones) during longer inactivity for MySQL, Grails 2 app
@CONTENT:I have a grails app that has flurries of high activity, but then often periods of inactivity that can last several hours to over night. I notice that the first users in the morning get the following type of exception, and I believe this is due to the connections in the pool going stale and MYSql database closing them. I've found conflicting information in Googling about whether using Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' is a good idea (and whether or not the client will still get an exception even if the connection is then restored), or whether to set other properties that will periodically evict or refresh idle connections, test on borrow, etc. Grails uses DBCP underneath. I currently have a simple config as below, and am looking for an answer on how to best ensure that any connection grabbed out of the pool after a long inactive period is valid and not closed. dataSource {
        pooled = true
        dbCreate = "update"

 There is already a question where this has been asked and the answer was, that it may be possible to do this with valgrind. Unfortunately the answer does not contain any examples or reference to the valgrind manual, so it was not very enlightning: How can gdb be used to watch for any changes in an entire region of memory? So: How can I watch the whole memory region?

@TITLE:Why does Active Directory validate last password?
@CONTENT:I am working on a simple solution to update a user's password in Active Directory. I can successfully update the users password. Updating the password works fine. Lets say the user has updated the password from MyPass1 to MyPass2 Now when I run my custom code to validate users credential using: using(PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "TheDomain"))
{
    // validate the credentials
    bool isValid = pc.ValidateCredentials("myuser", "MyPass2");
}

//returns true - which is good
 Now when I enter some wrong password it validates very nicely: using(PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "TheDomain"))
{
    // validate the credentials
    bool isValid = pc.ValidateCredentials("myuser", "wrongPass");
}

//returns false - which is good
 Now for some odd reasons, it validates the previous last password which was MyPass1 remember? using(PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "TheDomain"))
{
    // validate the credentials
    bool isValid = pc.ValidateCredentials("myuser", "MyPass1");
}

//returns true - but why? we have updated password to Mypass2
 I got this code from: Validate a username and password against Active Directory? Is it something to do with last password expiry or is this how the validation supposed to work?
@CODE:using(PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "TheDomain"))
{
    // validate the credentials
    bool isValid = pc.ValidateCredentials("myuser", "MyPass2");
}

//returns true - which is good using(PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "TheDomain"))
{
    // validate the credentials
    bool isValid = pc.ValidateCredentials("myuser", "wrongPass");
}

//returns false - which is good using(PrincipalContext pc = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "TheDomain"))
{
    // validate the credentials
    bool isValid = pc.ValidateCredentials("myuser", "MyPass1");

 When do you use a small one vs a large one? What are the differences? Does the number want to be in increments of 1024? Does it make a difference if it is an InputStream from the network vs the disk? Thanks much, I can't seem to find a clear answer elsewhere.

@TITLE:How can I format a date in Objective-C similar to the jquery.timeago library?
@CONTENT:I have a feed of items displayed in table cells, part of which is a date / timestamp in the past. In Objective-C, how can I accomplish formatting them in the same manner as the jquery.timeago plugin on the web? That is, taking in a date and outputting things like: 'just now' '2 minutes ago' '24 days ago' 'a month ago' I see there is an NSDate extension class here with methods such as dateWithDaysBeforeNow, dateWithMinutesBeforeNow, etc, but if there is a library out there that has already done this I will use it. EDIT: Further to this, if someone composes a method (takes a date, returns a string) that accomplishes this, either with this linked extensions library or another method, I will award them the answer. EDIT 2 Bounty goes to whoever can write the fuzzy date algorithm in Objective-C.

@CONTENT:I'm new to web programming and doing different tutorials that I can find on the net. I did my research and found out that in int(11), 11 is the maximum display width for integers and it's the default value if unless the integer is UNSIGNED (in this case it's 10). When I see something like this: id INT(11) not null AUTO_INCREMENT
 I have no questions. But why do I see different things in different tutorials? For examlpe, in some, it says, id INT(10) not null AUTO_INCREMENT
 And even id INT(4) not null AUTO_INCREMENT
 What are the authors of those tuts trying to achieve? None of them seem to bother to give an explanation what 10 or 4 means. Alright, they're obviously reducing the display width, but why? What's wrong with the default width of 11? Why would they want to change it? Or are there any other reasons I don't know of? Thanks.

@LINK:/questions/5986466/why-use-system-runtime-caching-or-system-web-caching-vs-static-variables
@TITLE:Why use System.Runtime.Caching or System.Web.Caching Vs static variables?
@CONTENT:Long time listener - first time caller. I am hoping to get some advice. I have been reading about caching in .net - both with System.Web.Caching and System.Runtime.Caching. I am wondering what additional benefits I can get vs simply creating a static variable with locking. My current (simple minded) caching method is like this: public class Cache
{
    private static List<Category> _allCategories;
    private static readonly object _lockObject = new object();

    public static List<Category> AllCategories
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lockObject)
            {
                if (_allCategories == null)
                {
                    _allCategories = //DB CALL TO POPULATE
                }
            }
            return _allCategories;
        }
    }
}
 Other than expiration (and I wouldn't want this to expire) I am at a loss to see what the benefit of using the built in caching are. Maybe there are benefits for more complex caching scenarios that don't apply to me - or maybe I am just missing something (would not be the first time). So, what is the advantage of using cache if I want a cache that never expires? Doesn't static variables do this?
@CODE:public class Cache
{
    private static List<Category> _allCategories;
    private static readonly object _lockObject = new object();

    public static List<Category> AllCategories
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lockObject)
            {
                if (_allCategories == null)
                {
                    _allCategories = //DB CALL TO POPULATE
                }

@CONTENT:i have an AutoCompleteTextView in my app which works. I have successfully created an onClickItemListener. The question is how to grab the text the user selected. And this is the thing: i have an ArrayList with words being passed to the Adapter to search for suggestions. As the user types a word the suggestions list gets shorter (in rows on the UI side) so when i want to get the word from the ArrayList at the index the user selected i get the wrong word because the indexes doesn't match. How can i get the text (String) the user chose without having to mess with the index? Here's my code: public class AutocompleteActivity extends BaseActivity {

    private DBManager m_db;

    @Override

@CONTENT:From reading other Stack Overflow entries and the boost::asio documentation, I've confirmed that there is no synchronous ASIO read/write calls that also provide an easy-to-use timeout as a parameter to the call. I'm in the middle of converting an old-school Linux socket application with select(2) calls that employs timeouts, and I need to do more-or-less the same. So what is the best way to do this in boost::asio? Looking at the asio documentation, there are many confusing examples of various things to do with timers, but I'm quite confused. I'd love to see a simple-to-read example of this: Read from a socket, but wait for a maximum of X seconds after which the function either returns with nothing, or returns with whatever it was able to read from the socket before the timeout expired.

 The intention here is to assert that all parameters passed to this function are Class objects extending the Class given as the first parameter. So the two first lines of main method would compile and the 3rd one generates an error. My question is: Why I get "Type safety : A generic array of Class is created for a varargs parameter" message for the first two lines? Am I missing something here? Additional question: how to redesign it to prevent this warning from being shown on every line calling "doNastyThingsToClasses" function? I can change it to "doNastyThingsToClasses(Class<A> parent, Class<?>... classes)" and get rid of the warnings but this also removes the compilation-time type checking --- not so good if I wanted to assure the right use of this function. Any better solution?

@TITLE:Scala implicit usage choices
@CONTENT:I've been wondering whether transparent implicit conversions are really such a good idea and whether it might actually be better to use implicits more, um, explicitly. For example, suppose I have a method which accepts a Date as a parameter and I have an implicit conversion which turns a String into a Date: implicit def str2date(s: String) : Date = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd").parse(s)

private def foo(d: Date)
 Then obviously I can call this with a transparent implicit conversion: foo("20090910")
 Would it be better to make the fact that I am converting the string into a date more explicit? class DateString(val s: String) { 
  def toDate : Date = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd").parse(s) 
}

implicit def str2datestr(s: String) : DateString = new DateString(s)
 So then the usage looks more like: foo("20090910".toDate)
 The advantage of this is that it is clearer later on what is happening - I've been caught out a few times now by transparent implicit conversions I should know about (Option to Iterable anyone?) and this usage still allows us to take advantage of the power of implicits.
@CODE:implicit Date String Date implicit def str2date(s: String) : Date = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd").parse(s)

@TITLE:Automatically upgrade user settings from previous version of app.config file?
@CONTENT:Every time I compile my app and the version number changes (I have an auto-incrementing build number), I lose the user-configured app.config settings, since they're stored in the AppData folder for a specific version. Essentially, every release of my application starts from scratch as far as user settings go. While this is a mild annoyance in development, it raises the question as I approach deployment/release - if I use the app.config to store my user settings, will the user's personalized settings be hosed every time they install a patch that changes the version number of my app? If so, is there an easy way to "upgrade" the settings from the previous release? I know that using HKCU in the registry is another option, but I like the ease of the My.Settings namespace, and I'd like to stay with app.config. Another SO question asks something similar, though the answer doesn't seem that clear. Will setting my MSI so it asks the user to upgrade be enough to preserve these user-level settings?

@TITLE:How do I get rid of the red rectangle when my wpf binding validation has failed and the containing panel is no longer visible?
@CONTENT:I have a situation where I am using wpf data binding and validation using the ExceptionValidationRule. Another part of the solution invovles collapsing some panels and showing others. If a validation exception is set - i.e. the UI is showing a red border around the UI element with the validation problem, and the containing panel is collapsed, the red border is still displayed. This is clearly not meant to be? Is there a workaround for this? Anyone know if this is by design? Minimal code example provided (not my actual code, but replicates the problem).

}
 To reproduce the problem, run the application. Delete the default text from the textbox and tab off - red rectangle is shown indicating a validation problem. Click the button. Panel containing control with red rectangle is hidden and another panel is shown, but the red rectangle remains. Aargh! All help much appreciated. PS apologies for long question title!

@LINK:/questions/7937/solve-the-select-overlap-bug-in-ie6
@TITLE:Solve the select overlap bug in IE6
@CONTENT:When using IE, you cannot put an absolutely positioned div over a select input element. That's because the select element is considered an ActiveX object and is on top of every HTML element in the page. I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing. FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect. Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere. Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned <div> as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible <iframe> inside the <div> and styling it with: #MyDiv iframe
{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    filter: mask();
    border: 0;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 9999px;
    height: 9999px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
 Does anyone have an even better solution than this one? EDIT: The purpose of this question is as much informative as it is a real question. I find the <iframe> trick to be a good solution, but I am still looking for improvement like removing this ugly useless tag that degrades accessibility.
@CODE:<div> <iframe> <div> #MyDiv iframe
{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;

@CONTENT:Because std::function is copyable, the standard requires that callables used to construct std::function also be copyable: n337 (20.8.11.2.1) template<class F> function(F f); Requires: F shall be CopyConstructible. f shall be Callable (20.8.11.2) for argument types ArgTypes and return type R. The copy constructor and destructor of A shall not throw exceptions.` This implies that it is not possible to form a std::function from a non-copyable bind object or a lambda that captured a move-only type such as a unique_ptr. It seems possible to implement such a move-only wrapper for move-only callables. Is there a standard library move-only equivalent for std::function? or, is there a common workaround for this problem?

@TITLE:How to determine the type of a variable in Swift
@CONTENT:Is there a function to determine the variable type in Swift? I presume there might be something like like type() in Python. I'd like a way to judge if a variable is a Foundation object or C variable in Swift. Like NSString vs String, or NSArray vs array. So that I can log it out in console and see clearly what it is. For example, I would like to know the type inferred for the the first array below: var array = [1,2,3]  // by default NSArray or array?
var array:[Int] = [1,2,3]
var array:NSArray = [1,2,3]
var array:Array<Any> = [1,2,3]
 I have seen answers for judging if a given variable is a kind of given type in this question, but I'll say it's quite different from what I want to ask.
@CODE:type() array var array = [1,2,3]  // by default NSArray or array?
var array:[Int] = [1,2,3]
var array:NSArray = [1,2,3]
var array:Array<Any> = [1,2,3] func show<T>(x:T) { println("\(x) is of type \(T)" }

@TITLE:Android: BLE how to read multiple Characteristics?
@CONTENT:Android BLE API methods for reading some characteristics are Asynchronous in nature and when you request some value, your GATT callback method is called. If you request multiple read characteristics values it just simply discards others until it doesn't entertained the first request. I didn't understand if that so why they made methods Async. If someone know which design pattern we should adapt to solve this problem please share. If you want to read some characteristics then you have to request it. // new value available will be notified in Callback Object

@TITLE:Printing with Attributes(Tray Control, Duplex, etcK) using javax.print library
@CONTENT:I've been trying for some time to determine a way to use the standard Java Print library to print files - specifically, PDF documents - with certain attributes - specifically, to certain trays or using duplex. There exists plenty of documentation on how this should be done, and indeed, I've researched and tried these methods. The typical way is something like this: public static void main (String [] args) {
    try {

        PrintService[] pservices = PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(null, null);

        //Acquire Printer
        PrintService printer = null;
        for (PrintService serv: pservices) {
            System.out.println(serv.toString());
            if (serv.getName().equals("PRINTER_NAME_BLAH")) {
                printer = serv;
            }
        }

        if (printer != null) {
            System.out.println("Found!");


            //Open File
            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("FILENAME_BLAH_BLAH.pdf");

            //Create Doc out of file, autosense filetype
            Doc pdfDoc = new SimpleDoc(fis, DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.AUTOSENSE, null);

            //Create job for printer
            DocPrintJob printJob = printer.createPrintJob();

            //Create AttributeSet
            PrintRequestAttributeSet pset = new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();

            //Add MediaTray to AttributeSet
            pset.add(MediaTray.TOP);

            //Add Duplex Option to AttributeSet
            pset.add(Sides.DUPLEX);

            //Print using Doc and Attributes
            printJob.print(pdfDoc, pset);

            //Close File
            fis.close();

        }

    }
    catch (Throwable t) {
        t.printStackTrace();
    }
}
 In short, you do the following Find the Printer Create a PrinterJob Create an AttributeSet Add Attributes to the AttributeSet, such as Tray and Duplex Call print on the printer job using the AttributeSet The problem here is that, despite being the documented way of doing this, as well as what I've found from several tutorials, this method... doesn't work. Now keep in mind, I know that doesn't sound very descript, but hear me out. I don't say that lightly... The official documentation for PrinterJob actually mentions that the AttributeSet is ignored in the default implementation. Source code seen here shows this to be true - the attributes are passed in and ignored entirely. So apparently, you need some sort of extended version of the class, which is possibly based on the specific printers and their capabilities? I attempted to write some test code that would tell me such capabilities - we have a large variety of printers set up at the office, large or small, simple or full of bells and whistles - not to mention several drivers on my computer just for pseudo-printer drivers that just create documents and simulate printers without going to any sort of hardware. The test code is as follows: public static void main (String [] args) {

    PrintService[] pservices = PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(null, null);

    for (PrintService serv: pservices) {
        System.out.println(serv.toString());

        printFunctionality(serv, "Trays", MediaTray.class);
        printFunctionality(serv, "Copies", Copies.class);
        printFunctionality(serv, "Print Quality", PrintQuality.class);
        printFunctionality(serv, "Color", ColorSupported.class);
        printFunctionality(serv, "Media Size", MediaSize.class);
        printFunctionality(serv, "Accepting Jobs", PrinterIsAcceptingJobs.class);
    }
}

private static void printFunctionality(PrintService serv, String attrName, Class<? extends Attribute> attr) {
    boolean isSupported = serv.isAttributeCategorySupported(attr);
    System.out.println("    " + attrName + ": " + (isSupported ? "Y" : "N"));
}
 The results I found were that every printer, without exception, returned that "copies" were supported, and all other attributes were not. Furthermore, every printer's capabilities were identical, regardless of how implausible that would seem. The inevitable question is multi-layered: How does one send in attributes in a way that they are registered? Additionally, how does one properly detect the capabilities of a printer? Indeed, is the PrinterJob class actually extended in a usable way at all, or are the Attributes always ignored? Examples I've found throughout The Internet seem to suggest to me that the answer to the latter question is "No, they are always ignored", which seems ridiculous to me (but increasingly more believable as I sift through hundreds of pages). Is this code that Sun simply set up but never got working to a completed state? If so, are there any alternatives?

    try {

@TITLE:Entity Framework spinup much slower on x64 vs x86
@CONTENT:My coworker posted this question yesterday: 7-second EF startup time even for tiny DbContext. After taking his code and moving it to a separate solution to isolate it as much as possible, I found that the containing project's platform target had a profound affect on the runtime of the EF startup process. When targeting x64, I saw that the test took ~7 seconds to spin up the first DbContext and <1 second to spin up the second DbContext (consistent with my coworker's findings who is also targeting x64). However when I switched the platform target to x86, the first DbContext spin up time was reduced by about 4 seconds down to 3.34633 seconds while the second DbContext took the same amount of time as the x64 case. Given this, it appears the Entity Framework is going through a much different initialization process when targeting a 64-bit system vs 32-bit system. Does anyone have any insight into what is going on under the hood to explain this?

@TITLE:Detect if dropdown navigation would go off screen and reposition it
@CONTENT:I've got your typical dropdown navigation, and I'm trying to make sure the drop menu links are always accessible and visible: <li><a href="#">Link 1</a>

        <li><a href="#">Link 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<!-- etc. -->
</ul>
 The CSS really isn't anything special (colors and backgrounds removed): .dropdown,
.dropdown li,
.dropdown ul {
    list-style:none;
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
}
.dropdown {
    position:relative;
    z-index:10000;
    float:left;
    width:100%;
}
.dropdown ul {
    position:absolute;
    top:100%;
    visibility:hidden;
    display:none;

}
.dropdown a {
    display:block;
    padding:1em 2em;
}
.dropdown ul li {
    width:100%;
}
 There are an unknown number of top level links (they are created by the user). The problem I'm having is that sometimes the drop menus (which go to the right) will go off screen if the top level link is too far to the right. I added this bit of CSS to compensate: .dropdown > li:last-child ul { /* ...or use a class on the last link for IE */
    right:0;
}
 Now the last one goes to the left instead of off screen, which is nice, but there are a few issues: I don't always need these styles for the last link since it isn't always at the edge of the screen (like if there are only 3 links). When the browser window is resized the links stack on top of each other (by design). Sometimes links in the middle of the sequence end up on the right edge, and their dropdowns are cut off. Sometimes the "next to last" link's menu will go outside the boundary as well. Resize the panel in this demo to see what I mean (the red area is considered "off screen") http://jsfiddle.net/G7qfq/ I've struggled with this annoyingly common problem for years and have never found a satisfactory solution. Is there any way to check if the drop menu would go off screen, and if so, add/remove a class name or something so I can keep it on screen with CSS? One clue I might use is that if a menu does go off screen, it always produces a vertical scroll bar at the bottom of the window, but I'm not sure how to use that knowledge. I tried the accepted answer to this question about detecting vertical scroll bars, but for some reason it always returns true, and always adds the "edge" class (maybe there's an issue with the timing?): $(".dropdown li").on('mouseenter mouseleave', function (e) {

    // Get the computed style of the body element
    var cStyle = document.body.currentStyle||window.getComputedStyle(document.body, "");

    // Check the overflow and overflowY properties for "auto" and "visible" values
    hasVScroll = cStyle.overflow == "visible" 
             || cStyle.overflowY == "visible"
             || (hasVScroll && cStyle.overflow == "auto")
             || (hasVScroll && cStyle.overflowY == "auto");

    if (hasVScroll) {
        $(this).addClass('edge');
    } else {
        $(this).removeClass('edge');
    }
});?
 Demo with the javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/G7qfq/2/ Really, I don't want to see a vertical scroll bar even for a split second so I'm not sure that's the way to go, plus there could be false positives (scroll bar for some other reason). I also tried the solution in this answer which I admit, I don't quite understand, and couldn't get it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/G7qfq/3/ $(".dropdown li").on('mouseenter mouseleave', function (e) {

    var elm = $('ul:first', this);
    var off = elm .offset();
    var t = off.top;
    var l = off.left;
    var h = elm.height();
    var w = elm.width();
    var docH = $(window).height();
    var docW = $(window).width();

    var isEntirelyVisible = (t > 0 && l > 0 && t + h < docH && l+ w < docW);

    if ( ! isEntirelyVisible ) {
        $(this).addClass('edge');
    } else {
        $(this).removeClass('edge');
    }
});?
 I assume the solution requires javascript, and I am using jQuery, but I haven't got a clue how to approach the problem. Any ideas?

@TITLE:SQL Server 2008 Service Broker tutorial X cannot receive the message (exception in transmission_status)
@CONTENT:I am learning how to use the Service Broker of SQL Server 2008 R2. When following the tutorial Completing a Conversation in a Single Database. Following the Lesson 1, I have successfully created the message types, contract, the queues and services. Following the Lesson 2, I have probably sent the message. However, when trying to receive the message, I get the NULL for the ReceivedRequestMsg instead of the sent content. When looking at the sys.transmission_queue, the transmission_status for the message says: An exception occurred while enqueueing a message in the target queue. Error: 15517, State: 1. Cannot execute as the database principal because the principal "dbo" does not exist, this type of principal cannot be impersonated, or you do not have permission. I have installed SQL Server using the Windows login like Mycomp\Petr. I am using that login also for the lessons. Can you guess what is the problem? What should I check and or set to make it working? Edited 2012/07/16: For helping to reproduce the problem, here is what I did. Can you reproduce the error if you follow the next steps? Firstly, I am using Windows 7 Enterprise SP1, and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, Developer Edition, 64-bit (ver. 10.50.2500.0, Root Directory located at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.SQL_PRIKRYL05\MSSQL). Following the tutorial advice, I have downloaded the AdventureWorks2008R2_Data.mdf sample database, and copied it into C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.SQL_PRIKRYL05\MSSQL\DATA\AdventureWorks2008R2_Data.mdf The SQL Server Management Studio had to be launched "As Administrator" to be able to attach the data later. Then I connected the SQL Server. Right click on Databases, context menu Attach..., button Add..., pointed to AdventureWorks2008R2_Data.mdf + OK. Then selected the AdventureWorks2008R2_Log.ldf from the grid below (reported as Not found) and pressed the Remove... button. After pressing OK, the database was attached and the AdventureWorks2008R2_log.LDF was created automatically. The following queries were used for looking at "Service Broker enabled/disabled", and for enabling (the Service Broker was enabled successfully for the database): USE master;
GO

SELECT name, is_broker_enabled FROM sys.databases;
GO

ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2008R2
      SET ENABLE_BROKER
      WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
GO

SELECT name, is_broker_enabled FROM sys.databases;
GO
 Then, following the tutorial, the queries below were executed to create the message types, the contract, the queues, and the services: USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
GO

CREATE MESSAGE TYPE
       [//AWDB/1DBSample/RequestMessage]
       VALIDATION = WELL_FORMED_XML;
CREATE MESSAGE TYPE
       [//AWDB/1DBSample/ReplyMessage]
       VALIDATION = WELL_FORMED_XML;
GO

CREATE CONTRACT [//AWDB/1DBSample/SampleContract]
      ([//AWDB/1DBSample/RequestMessage]
       SENT BY INITIATOR,
       [//AWDB/1DBSample/ReplyMessage]
       SENT BY TARGET
      );
GO

CREATE QUEUE TargetQueue1DB;

CREATE SERVICE
       [//AWDB/1DBSample/TargetService]
       ON QUEUE TargetQueue1DB
       ([//AWDB/1DBSample/SampleContract]);
GO

CREATE QUEUE InitiatorQueue1DB;

CREATE SERVICE
       [//AWDB/1DBSample/InitiatorService]
       ON QUEUE InitiatorQueue1DB;
GO
 So far, so good. Then the following queries are used to look at the queues (now empty when used): USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
GO

SELECT * FROM InitiatorQueue1DB WITH (NOLOCK);
SELECT * FROM TargetQueue1DB WITH (NOLOCK);
SELECT * FROM sys.transmission_queue;
GO
 The problem manifests when the message is sent: BEGIN TRANSACTION;

     FROM SERVICE
      [//AWDB/1DBSample/InitiatorService]
     TO SERVICE
      N'//AWDB/1DBSample/TargetService'

     MESSAGE TYPE

     (@RequestMsg);

SELECT @RequestMsg AS SentRequestMsg;

COMMIT TRANSACTION;

 When looking at the queues, the Initiator... and the Target... queues are empty, and the sent message can be found in sys.transmission_queue with the above mentioned error reported via the transmission_status.

@TITLE:How can I get Selenium Web Driver to wait for an element to be accessible, not just present?
@CONTENT:I am writing tests for a web application. Some commands pull up dialog boxes that have controls that are visible, but not available for a few moments. (They are greyed out, but webdriver still sees them as visible). How can I tell Selenium to wait for the element to be actually accessible, and not just visible?     try:
        print "about to look for element"
        element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda driver : driver.find_element_by_id("createFolderCreateBtn"))
        print "still looking?"
    finally: print 'yowp'
 Here is the code that I have tried, but it "sees" the button before it is usable and basically charges right past the supposed "wait". Note that I can stuff a ten second sleep into the code instead of this and the code will work properly, but that is ugly, unreliable, and inefficient. But it does prove that the problem is just that "click" command is racing ahead of the availability of the controls.
@CODE:try:
        print "about to look for element"
        element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda driver : driver.find_element_by_id("createFolderCreateBtn"))

@LINK:/questions/7048198/thread-safe-singletons-in-java
@TITLE:Thread Safe Singletons in Java
@CONTENT:The wikipedia article on Singletons mentions a few thread safe ways to implement the structure in Java. For my questions, let's consider Singletons that have lengthy initialization procedures and are acccessed by many threads at once. Firstly, is this unmentioned method thread-safe, and if so, what does it synchronize on? public class Singleton {
    private Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        //lots of initialization code
    }

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if(instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
 Secondly, why is the following implementation thread safe AND lazy in initialization? What exactly happens if two threads enter the getInstance() method at the same time? public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {
        //lots of initialization code
    }

    private static class SingletonHolder { 
        public static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.instance;
    }
}
 Finally, in the second example, what if one thread gets an instance first and another thread gets an instance and tries to perform actions on it before the constructor has finished in the first thread? Can you get into an unsafe state then?
@CODE:public class Singleton {
    private Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        //lots of initialization code
    }

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if(instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
} getInstance() public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {
        //lots of initialization code
    }

    private static class SingletonHolder { 
        public static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.instance;
    }

@TITLE:Removing a specific entry/row from Core-Data
@CONTENT:I'm using core data in my app, and i'm confused when it comes to removing certain rows or entries from the core data storage. I insert some products in to the storage like so: NSManagedObject *Product = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Product" inManagedObjectContext:context];
[Product setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:id] forKey:@"pid"];
[Product setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:quantity] forKey:@"pquantity"];
 This works fine for insertion. However, later in the app, I want to remove the entry where for example, the pid is 53. How would I go about removing only this row/entry? The equivalent SQL would be something like: DELETE from Product WHERE pid = '53'
 I would greatly appreciate some example code, as I can't seem to figure this one out. Thanks for any help.
@CODE:NSManagedObject *Product = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Product" inManagedObjectContext:context];
[Product setValue:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:id] forKey:@"pid"];

Essentially I need a couple of models, one controller and no views, plus some initialization, support for configuration parameters coming from the hosting app and a generator. Am I on the right way? What should I read to understand how to do that? Update: A very nice article with a lot af details can be found here. Essentially: Railtie is the core of the Rails Framework and provides several hooks to extend Rails and/or modify the initialization process. A Rails::Engine is nothing more than a Railtie with some initializers already set. And since Rails::Application and Rails::Plugin are engines, the same configuration described here can be used in all three.

@LINK:/questions/6384013/run-bash-commands-in-parallel-track-results-and-count
@TITLE:Run bash commands in parallel, track results and count
@CONTENT:I was wondering how, if possible, I can create a simple job management in BASH to process several commands in parallel. That is, I have a big list of commands to run, and I'd like to have two of them running at any given time. I know quite a bit about bash, so here are the requirements that make it tricky: The commands have variable running time so I can't just spawn 2, wait, and then continue with the next two. As soon as one command is done a next command must be run. The controlling process needs to know the exit code of each command so that it can keep a total of how many failed I'm thinking somehow I can use trap but I don't see an easy way to get the exit value of a child inside the handler. So, any ideas on how this can be done? Well, here is some proof of concept code that should probably work, but it breaks bash: invalid command lines generated, hanging, and sometimes a core dump. # need monitor mode for trap CHLD to work
set -m
# store the PIDs of the children being watched
declare -a child_pids

function child_done
{
    echo "Child $1 result = $2"
}

function check_pid
{
    # check if running
    kill -s 0 $1
    if [ $? == 0 ]; then
        child_pids=("${child_pids[@]}" "$1")
    else
        wait $1
        ret=$?
        child_done $1 $ret
    fi
}

# check by copying pids, clearing list and then checking each, check_pid
# will add back to the list if it is still running
function check_done
{
    to_check=("${child_pids[@]}")
    child_pids=()

    for ((i=0;$i<${#to_check};i++)); do
        check_pid ${to_check[$i]}
    done
}

function run_command
{
    "$@" &
    pid=$!
    # check this pid now (this will add to the child_pids list if still running)
    check_pid $pid
}

# run check on all pids anytime some child exits
trap 'check_done' CHLD

# test
for ((tl=0;tl<10;tl++)); do
    run_command bash -c "echo FAIL; sleep 1; exit 1;"
    run_command bash -c "echo OKAY;"
done

# wait for all children to be done
wait
 Note that this isn't what I ultimately want, but would be groundwork to getting what I want. Followup: I've implemented a system to do this in Python. So anybody using Python for scripting can have the above functionality. Refer to shelljob
@CODE:trap # need monitor mode for trap CHLD to work
set -m
# store the PIDs of the children being watched
declare -a child_pids

function child_done
{
    echo "Child $1 result = $2"

@TITLE:Color for the PROMPT (just the PROMPT proper) in cmd.exe and PowerShell?
@CONTENT:So in Bash you just configure PS1 to add colors to your prompt. I'm talking about the prompt proper, not the color of the foreground (text) or the background. And it's really easy in Bash and it helps a lot if you need to find your commands in a sea of messy text output. Can you achieve the same for cmd.exe, or as a fallback, for PowerShell? A colored prompt? I don't know if it could be done in the old days before Win32 by loading ANSI.SYS. I think that was just to make the foreground and the background colorful. But I might be wrong. And anyway, those days are gone, and in our modern times (I know), we're using cmd.exe, or PowerShell. I know both cmd.exe and PowerShell are capable of colored output. For cmd.exe, just run color /? to find out. But my question is not about the foreground and the background, that's all known to humankind - it's about just changing the prompt color for cmd.exe, probably via the PROMPT environment variable as via the PS1 variable for Bash? Is it possible? And no, Cygwin is not an alternative for this. I'm a Cygwin user with MinTTY and all, and I love it. But I still want my cmd.exe prompt colored, too.

        api.reinitialise();

        var api = $('#UploadList').data('jsp');
        api.reinitialise();

    case (liCount<=10 && liCount>5):
        setLayoutState('upload2Rows');
        var api = $('#UploadList').data('jsp');

        api.reinitialise();

@TITLE:Assignment of objects in VB6
@CONTENT:I am attempting to create two identical objects in VB6 by assignment statements; something like this... Dim myobj1 As Class1
Dim myobj2 As Class1

Set myobj1 = New Class1
myobj1.myval = 1
Set myobj2 = myobj1
 It has become apparent that this doesn't create two objects but rather two references to the same object, which isn't what I am after. Is there any way to create a second object in this sort of way, or do I have to copy the object one member at a time... Set myobj2 = new Class1
myobj2.mem1 = myobj1.mem1
...
 ? Edit 2 Scott Whitlock has updated his excellent answer and I have incorporated his changes into this now-working code snippet. Private Type MyMemento
     Value1 As Integer
     Value2 As String
End Type

Private Memento As MyMemento

Public Property Let myval(ByVal newval As Integer)
Memento.Value1 = newval
End Property

Public Property Get myval() As Integer
myval = Memento.Value1
End Property

Friend Property Let SetMemento(new_memento As MyMemento)

Public Function Copy() As Class1
     Dim Result As Class1
     Set Result = New Class1

 One then performs the assignment in the code thus... Set mysecondobj = myfirstobj.Copy

Also, Publish() converts cold to hot and Defer() converts hot to cold. But still, I feel I am missing the details. Here are some questions I'd like to have answered: Can you give a comprehensive definition for these terms? Does it ever make sense to call Publish on a hot observable or Defer on a cold? What are the aspects of Hot/Cold conversions - do you lose messages, for example? Are there differences between hot and cold definitions for IObservable and IEnumerable? What are the general principles you should take into account when programming for cold or hot? Any other tips on hot/cold observables?

@CONTENT:I'm using the built in navigation drawer to run my app. I can't quite figure out how to handle the back button. When it's pressed I want it to load the very first fragment again. Fragment1. So when the app launches you see Fragment1 launched. They can then click on Fragment 2-5 to go to other pages. Within all of these pages I want the back button to take the user back to Fragment1. The only place the user should be able to exit the app via the back button is Fragment1. SInce it's all handled by a FragmentActivity I tried messing with the backbutton there. I keep getting a force close error however: (01-11 14:09:33.114: E/AndroidRuntime(8292): android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #7: Error inflating class fragment)
 This is what I have so far: I've made sure to add the fragments to the back stack like this: fm.beginTransaction().replace(R.id.main, newFragment).addToBackStack("fragBack").commit();
 Back button: @Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    if (getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag("fragBack") != null) {

    }
    else {
        super.onBackPressed();
        return;
    }
    if (getSupportFragmentManager().getBackStackEntryCount() != 0) {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Test", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        Fragment frag = getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag("fragBack");
        FragmentTransaction transac = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().remove(frag);
                transac.commit();
    }

}
 Does anyone know what I need to do? Do I need to call onBackPressed in every fragment (if that's even possible) rather than the FragmentActivity that controls the drawer? In my past apps I've been OK with the back button closing the app regardless of which Fragment the user is on but the one I'm making now I want the back button to go back to Fragment1. Would really appreciate some help, thank you. onItemClick @Override

bool bContained2 = test2.Contains(test1);
 bContained1 = false but bContained2 = true. I would prefer not to loop through each list but instead use a Linq query to retrieve the data. bContained1 is the same condition for the Linq query that I have created below: List<string> test3 = test1.Where(w => !test2.Contains(w)).ToList();
 The query above works on an exact match but not partial matches. I have looked at other queries but I can find a close comparison to this with Linq. Any ideas or anywhere you can point me to would be a great help.

@LINK:/questions/12005790/how-to-receive-a-file-via-http-put-with-php
@TITLE:How to receive a file via HTTP PUT with PHP
@CONTENT:This is something that has been bugging me for a while.. I'm building of a RESTful API that has to receive files on some occasions. When using HTTP POST, we can read data from $_POST and files from $_FILES. When using HTTP GET, we can read data from $_GET and files from $_FILES. However, when using HTTP PUT, AFAIK the only way to read data is to use the php://input stream. All good and well, untill I want to send a file over HTTP PUT. Now the php://input stream doesn't work as expected anymore, since it has a file in there as well. Here's how I currently read data on a PUT request: (which works great as long as there are no files posted) $handle  = fopen('php://input', 'r');
$rawData = '';
while ($chunk = fread($handle, 1024)) {
    $rawData .= $chunk;
}

parse_str($rawData, $data);
 When I then output rawData, it shows -----ZENDHTTPCLIENT-44cf242ea3173cfa0b97f80c68608c4c
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image_01"; filename="lorem-ipsum.png"
Content-Type: image/png; charset=binary

testvalue
-----ZENDHTTPCLIENT-8e4c65a6678d3ef287a07eb1da6a5380
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="otherkey"

othervalue
 Does anyone know how to properly receive files over HTTP PUT, or how to parse files out of the php://input stream? ===== UPDATE #1 ===== I have tried only the above method, don't really have a clue as to what I can do else. I have gotten no errors using this method, besides that I don't get the desired result of the posted data and files. ===== UPDATE #2 ===== I'm sending this test request using Zend_Http_Client, as follows: (haven't had any problems with Zend_Http_Client so far) $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
$client->setConfig(array(
    'strict'       => false,
    'maxredirects' => 0,
    'timeout'      => 30)
);
$client->setUri( 'http://...' );
$client->setMethod(Zend_Http_Client::PUT);
$client->setFileUpload( dirname(__FILE__) . '/files/lorem-ipsum.png', 'image_01');
$client->setParameterPost(array('testkey' => 'testvalue', 'otherkey' => 'othervalue');
$client->setHeaders(array(
    'api_key'    => '...',
    'identity'   => '...',
    'credential' => '...'
));
 ===== SOLUTION ===== Turns out I made some wrong assumptions, mainly that HTTP PUT would be similar to HTTP POST. As you can read below, DaveRandom explained to me that HTTP PUT is not meant for transferring multiple files on the same request. I have now moved the transferring of formdata from the body to url querystring. The body now holds the contents of a single file. For more information, read DaveRandom's answer. It's epic.

@CONTENT:I need to pass a string to a program as its argument from the bash cli, e.g program "don't do this"
 The string may include any character like '$', '\', etc. and i don't want BASH to do any modification. So i think about using single quotes. However the following does not work:  program 'don\'t do this'            //escape doesn't work in single quote
 While the following two works:  program $'dont\'t do this'          //seems fine, but any other side effects?
 program 'dont'\''do this'           //breaking into 3 parts
 The first approach seems better in that it acquires less pre modification (put the dollar symbol in front and substitute every \ to \\), but i don't know what else the DOLLAR SIGN might do. I've really googled this but i can't find what i need.. Thanks in advance.

@TITLE:ImageField overwrite image file with same name
@CONTENT:I have model UserProfile with field avatar = models.ImageField(upload_to=upload_avatar). upload_avatar function names image file according user.id (12.png for example). But when user updates the avatar, new avatar name coincide with old avatar name and Django adds suffix to file name (12-1.png for example). There are way to overwrite file instead of create new file?

@TITLE:Sending multiple data parameters with jQuery AJAX
@CONTENT:I am sending an ajax request to a php file as shown here: function checkDB(code, userid)
{

  $.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/profile/check_code.php",
  data: 'code='+code+'userid='+userid,
  datatype: "html",
  success: function(result){

       if(result == 0)
        {
            $('#success').html( code + ' has been redeemed!');
            // alert('success');//testing purposes
        }
        else if(result == 2)
        {
            $('#err').html(  code + ' already exists and has already been redeemed....');
            //alert('fail');//testing purposes
        }else if(result == 1){
            $('#err').html(  code + ' redeem code doesnt exist');      
        }

        alert(result);      
      }
  })

}
 This is sent calling the function on submit, like so: <form method="post" class="sc_ajaxxx" id="sc_add_voucherx" name="sc_ajax"  
     onsubmit="checkDB(document.sc_ajax.sc_voucher_code.value, <?php echo $user_id ?>); return false;">
</form>
 The problem is that the user id php variable is not getting sent to the check_code.php page by ajax. or at least I cant seem to echo the id back to the page. Is this the correct way of passing multiple values to a server-side page? Without the userid passing over, it works fine just passing over the code. Thanks guys :)
@CODE:function checkDB(code, userid)
{

  $.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/profile/check_code.php",
  data: 'code='+code+'userid='+userid,
  datatype: "html",
  success: function(result){

       if(result == 0)
        {
            $('#success').html( code + ' has been redeemed!');
            // alert('success');//testing purposes
        }
        else if(result == 2)
        {
            $('#err').html(  code + ' already exists and has already been redeemed....');

        }else if(result == 1){
            $('#err').html(  code + ' redeem code doesnt exist');      
        }

        alert(result);      
      }
  })

} <form method="post" class="sc_ajaxxx" id="sc_add_voucherx" name="sc_ajax"  
     onsubmit="checkDB(document.sc_ajax.sc_voucher_code.value, <?php echo $user_id ?>); return false;">

@TITLE:PayPal IPN unique identifier
@CONTENT:I always assumed that txn_id sent with IPN message is unique. PayPal guidelines seem to support this idea - https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_admin_IPNIntro Avoid duplicate IPN messages. Check that you have not already processed the transaction identified by the transaction ID returned in the IPN message. You may need to store transaction IDs returned by IPN messages in a file or database so that you can check for duplicates. If the transaction ID sent by PayPal is a duplicate, you should not process it again. However I found that PayPal's eCheck payment IPN is sent twice with the same transaction ID. Once during initial payment with payment_status as "Pending" and again after couple days when eCheck is actually processes with payment_status as "Completed". I want to store both transactions, but still would like to avoid storing duplicates. There is another field in IPN called ipn_track_id and it's different for both transactions, but I can't find documentation for it, except this vague description: Internal; only for use by MTS and DTS Anyone else is using ipn_track_id to uniquely identify IPN messages?

@CONTENT:I have multiple, separate leiningen projects that ostensibly could depend on one-another. Example: ~/projects/mywebapp  (my own project)
~/projects/noir      (a clone of the github repo)
~/projects/clojureql (a clone of the github repo)
 I want to have them all compiled into the same JVM at the same time. I would like to run the git repos bleeding edge (pulling new commits/making my own commits) and not have to run lein jar or lein deps and certainly not have to restart the VM if I change any of the projects. Here's a use case: After running lein swank, from within emacs, I connect to the repl and compile a file from mywebapp (with C-c-k), which requires a file from noir. It finds the version of the file in my projects directory. Later, I open that file, edit it, and compile it (with C-c-k). Note that I'm not asking for auto-compiling when I do git pull. I just don't want to have to restart the JVM or do lengthy jar compiling processes. Is this possible in leiningen? How can I set this up?

@CONTENT:I am using Numpy to store data into matrices. Coming from R background, there has been an extremely simple way to apply a function over row/columns or both of a matrix. Is there something similar for python/numpy combination? It's not a problem to write my own little implementation but it seems to me that most of the versions I come up with will be significantly less efficient/more memory intensive than any of the existing implementation. I would like to avoid copying from the numpy matrix to a local variable etc., is that possible? The functions I am trying to implement are mainly simple comparisons (e.g. how many elements of a certain column are smaller than number x or how many of them have absolute value larger than y).

@TITLE:How to get a reversed String (unicode safe)
@CONTENT:Let us suppose we want to revert the following String "?e". The unicode for that is "\u0061\u0301\u0065". The naive aproach of reverting it would be char by char private static String reverseStringNaive(String s) {
    char[] characters = new char[s.length()];
    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int j = s.length() - i - 1;
        characters[j] = s.charAt(i); 
    }
    return new String(characters);
}
 which gives us "?a"(\u0065\u0301\u0061) when we hope to get "e?" (\u0065\u0061\u0301). The accute accent "?" should stick together with the "a", not change to the "e". The following code gives me the expected result for that String: private static String reverseString(String s) {
    char[] characters = new char[s.length()];
    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int j = s.length() - i - 1;
        if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(i)) || Character.isISOControl(s.charAt(i))) {
            characters[j] = s.charAt(i); 
        } else {
            characters[j] = s.charAt(i-1);
            characters[j+1] = s.charAt(i);
            i--;
        }
    }
    return new String(characters);
}
 I'm checking if each character is Letter, Digit or ISO Control. If not, I'm assuming it should stick together with the previous character. The question is, are there other things I should check or worry about? Is my aproach still naive?

@TITLE:How to copy/create derived class instance from a pointer to a polymorphic base class?
@CONTENT:I have been struggling with this kind of problem for a long time, so I decided to ask here. class Base {
  virtual ~Base();
};
class Derived1 : public Base { ... };
class Derived2 : public Base { ... };
...

// Copies the instance of derived class pointed by the *base pointer
Base* CreateCopy(Base* base);
 The method should return a dynamically created copy, or at least store the object on stack in some data structure to avoid "returning address of a temporary" problem. The naive approach to implement the above method would be using multiple typeids or dynamic_casts in a series of if-statements to check for each possible derived type and then use the new operator. Is there any other, better approach? P.S.: I know, that the this problem can be avoided using smart pointers, but I am interested in the minimalistic approach, without a bunch of libraries.
@CODE:class Base {
  virtual ~Base();
};
class Derived1 : public Base { ... };
class Derived2 : public Base { ... };
...

// Copies the instance of derived class pointed by the *base pointer
Base* CreateCopy(Base* base); typeid dynamic_cast new

@CONTENT:I have a table with 4 columns: ID, type, owner, description. ID is AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY and now I want to: ALTER IGNORE TABLE `my_table`
    ADD UNIQUE (`type`, `owner`);
 Of course I have few records with type = 'Apple' and owner = 'Apple CO'. So my question is which record will be the special one to stay after that ALTER TABLE, the one with smallest ID or maybe the one with biggest as the latest inserted?

@TITLE:EF Code First 4.1 doesn't support nvarchar(max) at all?
@CONTENT:I've spent decent amount of time on this problem and still can't figure out why EF team makes the life so hard using Code First. So here is some sample: My POCO: The way I want the thing to look like: public class Post
{
     public int Id {get; set;}
     public string Text {get; set;}
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Post>()
        .Property(p => p.Text)
        .HasColumnType("nvarchar(max)");   
}
 The only thing that works: public class Post
{
     public int Id {get; set;}

     [StringLength(4000)]
     public string Text {get; set;}
}
 The problem is that when in first case I try to insert anything it gives me: Validation failed for one or more entities and the second case doesn't fit my business model. Am I the only one with this problem? How do I deal with this thing?
@CODE:public class Post
{
     public int Id {get; set;}
     public string Text {get; set;}
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Post>()
        .Property(p => p.Text)
        .HasColumnType("nvarchar(max)");   
} public class Post
{
     public int Id {get; set;}

@TITLE:Deploying custom dll's in SharePoint 2010
@CONTENT:I'm new to SharePoint and trying to get my head around this. I have a simple Web Part project. I also have a custom Data layer project that uses the Microsoft Enterprise Library for data access. In the Web Part project, I am adding a reference to the Data layer project's assembly. I specified in the Package of the Web Part project that I want my Data layer's assembly to be deployed. I can verify this works by using standard ADO.NET classes and not the custom MS library. If I deploy to the SharePoint server (which I have 100% access to) using the Enterprise Library, I get the error message: "Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Data" What steps do I need to take to ensure this project and all future projects on the server can easily gain access to the Enterprise Library for data access? Thanks!

@TITLE:PHP - SimpleXML - AddChild with another SimpleXMLElement
@CONTENT:I'm trying to build a rather complex XML document. I have a bunch of sections of the XML document that repeats. I thought I'd use multiple string templates as base document for the sections and create instances of XML elements using simplexml_load_string. So I have one instance of SimpleXMLElement as the base document $root = simplexml_load_string($template_root); then I loop through some items in my database, create new SimpleXMLElement, something like this: for (bla bla bla): $item = simplexml_load_string($template_item); // do stuff with item // try to add item to the root document.. // Stuck here.. can't do $root->items->addChild($item) endfor; I can't call addChild because it just expects a tag name and value.. you can't addChild another SimpleXMLElement. Am I missing something here? seems really dumb that addChild can't take a SimpleXMLELement as a parameter. Is there any other way to do this? (apart from using a different xml lib)

@TITLE:500 Server error: Premature end of script headers:
@CONTENT:I have a website in php that works with a solr indexation server, based on CodeIgniter. We got a lot of new content, so we flushed the database, and had to reindex the content (about 168,000 elements). I created a script to index the contents by slices of 500 V when the script finishes, we launch the next indexing. It works perfectly on my local test environment, but on production I get this 500 error: [Thu Dec 02 ...] [error] [client IP] Premature end of script headers: index.php
 There is absolutely nothing in my php.log, just the apache error_log that returns it. I've seen it happen on other pages of the website once or twice, but it was during this indexing. Any ideas?

@TITLE:Makefile to put object files from source files different directories into a single, separate directory?
@CONTENT:I'm using UnitTest++ to allow me to create unit tests for some C++ code (that should build on Linux or Mac OS X). I have a directory structure like this: src
- Foo.cpp
- Bar.cpp
test
- FooTest.cpp
- BarTest.cpp
- Main.cpp
- Makefile
UnitTest++
- libUnitTest++.a
 And this Makefile (adapted from the UnitTest++ Makefile) works nicely (with GNU make): test = TestFooAndBar

src = ../src/Foo.cpp \
    ../src/Bar.cpp

test_src = Main.cpp \
    FooTest.cpp \
    BarTest.cpp

lib = ../UnitTest++/libUnitTest++.a

objects = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(src))
test_objects = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(test_src))


.PHONY: all
all: $(test)
    @echo Running unit tests...
    @./$(test)

$(test): $(lib) $(test_objects) $(objects)
    @echo Linking $(test)...
    @$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(test) $(test_objects) $(objects) $(lib)

%.o : %.cpp
    @echo $<
    @$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$<)
 But I want to put all the .o files in an "obj" subdirectory of the "test" directory. How do I modify this Makefile to do so? I've tried adding "obj/" to the objects and test_objects variables, but I can't figure out how to modify the %.o rule so it knows where the .o files are and refers to the correct .cpp files. Do I need to create two separate rules, one for each set of .cpp files? Would it be simpler if instead of defining the src and test_src variables, I just have the Makefile build a .o (into obj/) for all .cpp files (both in the same directory as the Makefile and in ../src/)?

@CONTENT:Is there a standard way to do this? Googling -- "approximate entropy" bits -- uncovers multiple academic papers but I'd like to just find a chunk of pseudocode defining the approximate entropy for a given bit string of arbitrary length. (In case this is easier said than done and it depends on the application, my application involves 16,320 bits of encrypted data (cyphertext). But encrypted as a puzzle and not meant to be impossible to crack. I thought I'd first check the entropy but couldn't easily find a good definition of such. So it seemed like a question that ought to be on StackOverflow! Ideas for where to begin with de-cyphering 16k random-seeming bits are also welcome...)

@TITLE:Are final static variables thread safe in Java?
@CONTENT:I've read around quite a bit but haven't found a definitive answer. I have a class that looks like this:     public class Foo() {

        private static final HashMap<String, HashMap> sharedData;

        private final HashMap myRefOfInnerHashMap;

        static {
           // time-consuming initialization of sharedData
           final HashMap<String, String> innerMap = new HashMap<String, String>;
           innerMap.put...
           innerMap.put...
           ...a

           sharedData.put(someKey, java.util.Collections.unmodifiableMap(innerMap));
        }

        public Foo(String key) {
            this.myRefOfInnerHashMap = sharedData.get(key);
        }

        public void doSomethingUseful() {
            // iterate over copy
            for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : this.myRefOfInnerHashMap.entrySet()) {
                ...
            }
        }
     }
 And I'm wondering if it is thread safe to access sharedData from instances of Foo (as is shown in the constructor and in doSomethingUseful()). Many instances of Foo will be created in a multi-threaded environment. My intention is that sharedData is initialized in the static initializer and not modified thereafter (read-only). What I've read is that immutable objects are inherently thread safe. But I've only seen this in what seems to be the context of instance variables. Are immutable static variables thread safe? The other construct I found was a ConcurrentHashMap. I could make sharedData of type ConcurrentHashMap but do the HashMaps it contains also have to be of type ConcurrentHashMap? Basically.. private static final ConcurrentHashMap<String, HashMap> sharedData;
 or private static final ConcurrentHashMap<String, ConcurrentHashMap> sharedData;
 Or would it be safer (yet more costly to simply clone())? this.myCopyOfData = sharedData.get(key).clone();
 TIA. (Static initializer has been edited to give more context.)

        private static final HashMap<String, HashMap> sharedData;

It seems that the easiest way to avoid tokens and file modifications in my installer script, is to ask the user for an install location, set this location as an environment variable (e.g JAVA_HOME), and have web.xml always reference that variable. Is there a way to reference an environment variable value from within web.xml? Google searches lead to the J2EE method of SETTING environment variables from ejb xml files. This is not what I'm looking for.

@TITLE:WinForms Interop, Drag & Drop from WinForms -> WPF
@CONTENT:I'm trying to drag data from the Winforms portion of my application on a WPF controls that's contained inside an "ElementHost". And it crashes when I try doing so. Trying the same thing but from Winforms to Winforms works fine. (See example code below) I need help on making this work... have any clues what I'm doing wrong? Thanks! Example: In the sample code below, I'm just trying to drag a custom MyContainerClass object created when initating the drag on the label control on a 1) System.Windows.Forms.TextBox (Winforms) and 2) System.Windows.TextBox (WPF, added to an ElementHost). Case 1) works fine but case 2) is crashing when trying to retrieve the drop data using GetData(). GetDataPresent("WindowsFormsApplication1.MyContainerClass") returns "true" so In theory, I should be able to retrive my drop data of that type like in Winforms. Here is the stack trace of the crash: 
"Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component" with the following stack trace:

@CONTENT:I am kind of confused on how Flush ( and NHibernate.ISession) in NHibernate works. From my code, it seems that when I saved an object by using ISession.Save(entity), the object can be saved directly to the database. However, when I update and object using ISession.SaveOrUpdate(entity) or ISession.Update(entity), the object in the database is not updated--- I need to call ISession.Flush in order to update it. The procedure on how I update the object is as follows: Obtain the object from the database by using ISession.Get(typeof(T), id) Change the object property, for example, myCar.Color="Green" Commit it back to the database by using ISession.Update(myCar) The myCar is not updated to database. However, if I call ISession.Flush afterwards, then it is updated. When to use Flush, and when not to use it?

@TITLE:NHibernate - Only retrieve specific columns when using Critera queries?
@CONTENT:I'm propositioning NHibernate for a project we're doing at my company and I'd like to know if NHibernate can be optimized to only retrieve specific columns on a table when using the Criteria query language. For example. Let's say I have a table with 30 columns on it and this is mapped to an object using NHibernate that is a 1-for-1 match against the table. However, for a particular function of the system I only care about two of those columns. Now, I know I can use HQL and do a CreateQuery that will accomplish this but that requires I create a constructor for each combination of fields I'd like to selectively retrieve. This could be a huge pain from a maintenance standpoint since I won't catch missing constructors till runtime. I like the Criteria query language since it produces parametrized SQL instead of straight SQL queries from HQL. I see there is an "Exclude" model for not including certain columns but in most cases I will include more columns than exclude. UPDATE: Thanks to the comment below I looked into projections and this still isn't quite the ideal situation for me. When using the following: var list = session .CreateCriteria(typeof (Task)) .SetProjection(Projections.ProjectionList().Add(Projections.Property("Id"))) .List(); I end up with the variable "list" just being ints, I'd prefer to have my full Task object but with all the fields set to their default values. Is this even possible? Everything I see so far says no. Thanks!

I need random access to the text file to seek to the beginning of each record after a user asks for it. I have to do it this way because the file is too large to be read in completely in memory (1GB+) with the other memory demands of the application. I've tried using the .NET StreamReader class to accomplish this (which provides very easy to use 'ReadLine' functionality, but there is no way to capture the true position of the file (the position in the BaseStream property is skewed due to the buffer the class uses).

@LINK:/questions/18154164/how-does-thread-abort-work
@TITLE:How does Thread.Abort() work?
@CONTENT:We usually throw exception when invalid input is passed to a method or when a object is about to enter invalid state. Let's consider the following example private void SomeMethod(string value)
{
    if(value == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException("value");
    //Method logic goes here
}
 In the above example I inserted a throw statement which throws ArgumentNullException. My question is how does runtime manages to throw ThreadAbortException. Obviously it is not possible to use a throw statement in all the methods, even runtime manages to throw ThreadAbortException in our custom methods too. I was wondering how do they do it? I was curious to know what is happening behind the scenes, I opened a reflector to open Thread.Abort and end up with this [MethodImplAttribute(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
private extern void AbortInternal();//Implemented in CLR
 Then I googled and found this How does ThreadAbortException really work. This link says that runtime posts APC through QueueUserAPC function and that's how they do the trick. I wasn't aware of QueueUserAPC method I just gave a try to see whether it is possible with some code. Following code shows my try. [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
static extern uint QueueUserAPC(ApcDelegate pfnAPC, IntPtr hThread, UIntPtr dwData);
delegate void ApcDelegate(UIntPtr dwParam);

Thread t = new Thread(Threadproc);
t.Start();
//wait for thread to start
uint result = QueueUserAPC(APC, new IntPtr(nativeId), (UIntPtr)0);//returns zero(fails)
int error = Marshal.GetLastWin32Error();// error also zero

private static void APC(UIntPtr data)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Callback invoked");
}
private static void Threadproc()
{
    //some infinite loop with a sleep
}
 If am doing something wrong forgive me, I have no idea how to do it. Again back to question, Can somebody with knowledge about this or part of CLR team explain how it works internally? If APC is the trick runtime follows what am doing wrong here?
@CODE:private void SomeMethod(string value)

    if(value == null)

@CONTENT:I've been looking around for a simple and small yet robust and fast (not comprehensive!) image library for C++ (C would suffice, if no C++ version is available). Main features I'm looking for are: Free (opensource is a plus) Built for speed No huge functional bloat (like ImageMagik, which is truly comprehensive but is a mammoth) Tiny memory footprint Only supports the absolute minimum of functions like load/save, resize, convert between formats. Nothing fancy Error recovery for "broken" files (unlike stb_image.c, which has pretty poor error recovery) MSVC and gcc friendly (I used CxImage for a number of years but with the latest version I'm having problems with MSVC 2010 and it would seem that active development and support for it has died out by now, so I'm about to drop it) Should support popular modern formats, like JPEG2000, either directly or via a use of general libraries like libpng Don't care if it's DirectX or OpenGL as I don't plan on using it to display the images - only to file-process them for a web site Having support for both static and dynamic linking is a plus Threading support is a huge plus Libraries I looked at and dismissed for one reason or another: CxImage (no active development on it anymore) ImageMagik - too huge (and slow) stb_image.c - bad error handling, doesn't support enough image formats DevIL (havn't dismissed yet, but haven't looked at it much either - just learnt of it a few minutes ago on a similar post on SO) - based on it's size and feature set it looks very promising for what I need though FreeImage (same as DevIL - will take a look at it shortly but it's a bit big in size to my taste) SOIL (same as stb_image.c) TimThumb - it's a PHP, not a C/C++ In short I just want something as tiny as possible and as fast as possible at the expense of just having the absolute bare minimum of functionality but I'm yet to find a suitable candidate thus far. Any suggestions from this community, please? But keep in mind the constraints I listed above - I don't think it's OK to throw an answer of a form "have you tried X?" where "X" doesn't meet half of my needs :) Edit: Looking a bit more into DevIL it would seem it could be what I need. It's light, tiny, robust. Now I just need to make sure it performs. Oh, and CImage (I forgot to mention it in the list) - didn't like it's performance (though I have to admit that the idea of template-only implementation is cute, to say the least)

@TITLE:Python Matplotlib Basemap overlay small image on map plot
@CONTENT:I am plotting data from an aircraft on a map and I would like to insert this 75px by 29px PNG image of an airplane at the coordinates of the latest data point on the plot. As far as I know and have read, pyplot.imshow() is the best way to accomplish this. However, I am getting hung up on step 1, getting the image to even display. Using a normal plot instead of Basemap, it is easy enough to get the image to appear using imshow, but when using Basemap, I can't get it to show up at all. See the example code. If I can get the image to display on the map, I am assuming that I can, by trial and error, set its position and some proper dimensions for it using the extent attribute of imshow(), with the plot coordinates converted from the map coordinates x,y = m(lons,lats). Here is the example code (to try it you may want to download the airplane image above). from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import Image
from numpy import arange

lats = arange(26,29,0.5)
lons = arange(-90,-87,0.5)

m = Basemap(projection='cyl',llcrnrlon=min(lons)-2,llcrnrlat=min(lats)-2,
            urcrnrlon=max(lons)+2,urcrnrlat=max(lats)+2,resolution='i')

x,y = m(lons,lats)
u,v, = arange(0,51,10),arange(0,51,10)
barbs = m.barbs(x,y,u,v)
m.drawcoastlines(); m.drawcountries(); m.drawstates()

img = Image.open('c130j_75px.png')
im = plt.imshow(img, extent=(x[-1],x[-1]+50000,y[-1],y[-1]+50000))
plt.show()
 Here's the resulting image, which doesn't contain a trace of the airplane. I have tried several different sizes using extent, thinking I may have just made it too small, but with no success. I also tried setting zorder=10, but also with no luck. Any help would be appreciated. Update: I can now get the image to at least appear by using m.imshow instead of plt.imshow, since the former passes in the map's axes instance, but the extent argument seems to have no effect on the dimensions of the image, as it always fills up the entire plot no matter how small I make extent dimensions, even if I set them to zero. How can I scale the airplane image appropriately and position it near the last data point? im = m.imshow(img, extent=(x[-1],x[-1]+5,y[-1],y[-1]+2))
@CODE:pyplot.imshow() extent imshow() x,y = m(lons,lats) from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import Image
from numpy import arange

lats = arange(26,29,0.5)
lons = arange(-90,-87,0.5)

m = Basemap(projection='cyl',llcrnrlon=min(lons)-2,llcrnrlat=min(lats)-2,
            urcrnrlon=max(lons)+2,urcrnrlat=max(lats)+2,resolution='i')

x,y = m(lons,lats)
u,v, = arange(0,51,10),arange(0,51,10)
barbs = m.barbs(x,y,u,v)
m.drawcoastlines(); m.drawcountries(); m.drawstates()

img = Image.open('c130j_75px.png')
im = plt.imshow(img, extent=(x[-1],x[-1]+50000,y[-1],y[-1]+50000))
plt.show() extent zorder=10 m.imshow plt.imshow extent extent im = m.imshow(img, extent=(x[-1],x[-1]+5,y[-1],y[-1]+2))

 I am trying to dump my data from the database with the command django-admin.py dumpdata
 My approach is to run cd ~/dev/django-project and then run source virtual_environment/bin/activate and then run django-admin.py dumpdata However, I am getting the following error: ImportError: Settings cannot be imported, because environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is undefined.
 I did some googling and found this page: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#designating-the-settings which tell me that When you use Django, you have to tell it which settings you're using. Do this by using an environment variable, DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. The value of DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE should be in Python path syntax, e.g. mysite.settings. Note that the settings module should be on the Python import search path. Following a suggestion at Setting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE under virtualenv? I appended the lines export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="blossom.settings"
echo $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
 to virtual_environment/bin/activate. Now, when I run the activate command in order to activate the virtual environment, I get output reading: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE set to blossom.settings
 This looks good to me, but now the problem I have is that running django-admin.py dumpdata
 returns the following error: ImportError: Could not import settings 'blossom.settings' (Is it on sys.path?): No module named blossom.settings
 What am I doing wrong? How can I check thesys.path? How is this supposed to work? Thanks.

@CONTENT:Forgive me, this has been driving me insane, and I'll try to post something legible through my seething anger. I've seen a couple of posts on here on how to check if the screen is locked, but none of it has been working for me. It all detects if the actual screen is off or not (not if it's locked). I have a game in which music plays. When the lock button is pressed, it continues to play. I originally had the music stopping in OnStop, but the application would restart after getting locked, so the music would eventually start up again. Then, I added KeyboardHidden|orientation to the manifest. This makes it so it doesn't restart the app, but OnStop doesn't seem to get called anymore. I've tried using PowerManager to see if the screen is on/off, which works, but doesn't help. (I can get the music to stop there, but as soon as you hit the lock button again, the music starts right back up)

@TITLE:WPF ComboBox performance problems by binding a large collections
@CONTENT:I'm trying to bind a large collection to a ComboBox and I faced performance problems when opening ComboBox's popup. I searched internet and found that using VirtualizingStackPanel as a items panel template might help, but it helped only partially. If I bind a large collection to a ComboBox, I could open popup very quickly, that's ok, but if after that I bind another collection to a ComboBox and try to open popup again, it becomes very slow. Same is happening if you open popup for an empty ComboBox, then bind large collection and try to open popup again - it takes some seconds before popup opens. Here is the XAML: <ComboBox Name="cbBlah">
    <ComboBox.ItemsPanel>
        <ItemsPanelTemplate>
            <VirtualizingStackPanel />
        </ItemsPanelTemplate>
    </ComboBox.ItemsPanel>
</ComboBox>
 and the sample code for binding to reproduce the problem: var list = new List<string>();
for (var i = 0; i < new Random().Next(9000, 10000); i++)
    list.Add(i.ToString());
cbBlah.ItemsSource = list;
 I tried to make virtualizing stack panel to look like this: <VirtualizingStackPanel VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing="True" VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode="Recycling" />
 but it doesn't help, seems VirtualizationMode is ignored so popup opens very fast only first time and then, each time after binding changes, it's very slow. UPDATE: I thought about not binding new collection every time, but bind an ObservableCollection once and then just changing its content. Same thing, as soon as content of collection changes, opening a popup still takes several seconds :(
@CODE:<ComboBox Name="cbBlah">
    <ComboBox.ItemsPanel>
        <ItemsPanelTemplate>
            <VirtualizingStackPanel />
        </ItemsPanelTemplate>
    </ComboBox.ItemsPanel>
</ComboBox> var list = new List<string>();
for (var i = 0; i < new Random().Next(9000, 10000); i++)
    list.Add(i.ToString());
cbBlah.ItemsSource = list; <VirtualizingStackPanel VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing="True" VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode="Recycling" />

@TITLE:Java ConcurrentHashMap is better than HashMap performance wise?
@CONTENT:I was just reading the book Clean Code and came across this statement: When Java was young Doug Lea wrote the seminal book[8] Concurrent Programming in Java. Along with the book he developed several thread-safe collection, which later became part of the JDK in the java.util.concurrent package. The collections in that package are safe for multithreaded situations and they perform well. In fact, the ConcurrentHashMap implementation performs better than HashMap in nearly all situations. It also allows for simultaneous concurrent reads and writes, and it has methods supporting common composite operations that are otherwise not thread safe. If Java 5 is the deployment environment, start with ConcurrentHashMap Note that in the above quote I used "[n]", where n is some number, to indicate the places where the author provided references, and as you can see he did not provide any reference for the bold part. Not that I don't believe this statement, but I would love to know the supporting evidences of this statement. So, does anyone know any resources that shows the performance statistics for both ConcurrentHashMap and HashMap? Or can anyone explain to me why ConcurrentHashMap is faster than HashMap? I probably will look into ConcurrentHashMap's implementation at work when I'm taking a break, but for now I would like to hear the answers from fellow SOers.

    base(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["leConnString"].ToString(), mappingSource)
    {
        OnCreated();
    }
 However whenever i modify or add a table into the dbml, it will start to auto replace that code into this  public leDataContext() : 
            base("Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;AttachDbFilename=\"D:\\My Projects\\App_Data\\le.mdf\";Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;User Instance=True", mappingSource)
    {
        OnCreated();
    }
 i have expanded the "Connection" option. Set "Application Settings" to False
@CODE:public leDataContext() : 
    base(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["leConnString"].ToString(), mappingSource)
    {
        OnCreated();
    } public leDataContext() : 
            base("Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;AttachDbFilename=\"D:\\My Projects\\App_Data\\le.mdf\";Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;User Instance=True", mappingSource)

@TITLE:Java ConcurrentHashMap is better than HashMap performance wise?
@CONTENT:I was just reading the book Clean Code and came across this statement: When Java was young Doug Lea wrote the seminal book[8] Concurrent Programming in Java. Along with the book he developed several thread-safe collection, which later became part of the JDK in the java.util.concurrent package. The collections in that package are safe for multithreaded situations and they perform well. In fact, the ConcurrentHashMap implementation performs better than HashMap in nearly all situations. It also allows for simultaneous concurrent reads and writes, and it has methods supporting common composite operations that are otherwise not thread safe. If Java 5 is the deployment environment, start with ConcurrentHashMap Note that in the above quote I used "[n]", where n is some number, to indicate the places where the author provided references, and as you can see he did not provide any reference for the bold part. Not that I don't believe this statement, but I would love to know the supporting evidences of this statement. So, does anyone know any resources that shows the performance statistics for both ConcurrentHashMap and HashMap? Or can anyone explain to me why ConcurrentHashMap is faster than HashMap? I probably will look into ConcurrentHashMap's implementation at work when I'm taking a break, but for now I would like to hear the answers from fellow SOers.

Scenario is like: Our application is using 60K of memory with list of records displaying in a Grid. When user click on a record it opens a form myform.showDialog, show the details. Memory jumps from 60 to 105M Now we close the form myform to get back to grid, and dispose that form and set it to null. Memory remains at 105M. Now if we again perform step 2, it would jump from 105M to 150M and so on. Can some one tell how can we free up the memory when we close the myForm? Any help in this regard would be highly appreciated. We have already tried GC.Collect() etc. but no result.

Upon reading this article Enterprise Integration, and with little to no experience I am wondering if BizTalk has is a ESB or is it just a EAI (Hub/Spokes or Bus)? I found this NServiceBus and Biztalk, describing BizTalk as a central message broker. Taking other ESB frameworks into account (NServiceBus and Rhino Service Bus).

@TITLE:Transaction comes back after finishTransaction: has been called on it
@CONTENT:I am using in-app purchase for an iPhone app. I have a class that acts as SKProductsRequestDelegate and SKPaymentTransactionObserver, and it's all working fine in the currently released version available on iTunes. However, after recently adding a new non-consumable product and testing it within the Sandbox environment, I'm now encountering a strange problem. Every time I launch the app, the purchase I made yesterday reappears in the transactions list passed to me by paymentQueue:updatedTransactions:, despite the fact that I had called [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] finishTransaction:transaction] already (several times). It's undead! In my paymentQueue:updatedTransactions: implementation, I have: for (SKPaymentTransaction* transaction in transactions) 
    switch (transaction.transactionState)
    {
        case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased:
        case SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored:
        {
            ....
                DDLog(@"Transaction for %@ occurred originally on %@.", transaction.payment.productIdentifier, transaction.originalTransaction.transactionDate);
                ....
 I then process the purchase, download the user content and finally, in another method, do this: for (SKPaymentTransaction* transaction in [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] transactions])         
            if (([transaction.payment.productIdentifier isEqualToString:theParser.currentProductID]) &&
                 ((transaction.transactionState==SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased) || (transaction.transactionState==SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored))
               )
            {
                DDLog(@"[[ Transaction will finish: product ID = %@; date = %@ ]]", transaction.payment.productIdentifier, transaction.transactionDate);
                [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] finishTransaction:transaction];
            }
 As you may have noticed, I'm not holding on to the original transaction object for the sake of simplicity, and it's relatively easy to find it later from the call to [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] transactions]. Regardless, I do indeed see the expected output; that the transaction is completed and that it precisely matches the product ID and date of the original transaction. However, next time I run the app the whole things starts over! It's like the iTunes Store was never notified that the transaction completed, or refuses to acknowledge it.

Then do a recursive search. I tried one another way to do this too : Using FSO (obj.GetFolder(path).Size). There's not much of difference in time in both these approaches. Now the problem is, I have tens of thousands of files in a particular folder and its taking like atleast 2 minute to find the folder size. Also, if I run the program again, it happens very quickly (5 secs). I think the windows is caching the file sizes. Is there any way I can bring down the time taken when I run the program first time??

When I resize my UIView using a standard animation block, the UIView itself and its CALayer resize just fine. The mask, however, is applied instantly, which leads to some drawing issues. I've tried animating the mask's resizing using a CABasicAnimation but didn't have any luck getting the resizing animated. Can I somehow achieve an animated resizing effect on the mask? Do I need to get rid of the mask, or will I have to change something about the way I currently draw the mask (using - (void)drawInContext:(CGContextRef)ctx). Cheers, Alex

@CONTENT:I've found a few answers for this using mySQL alone, but I was hoping someone could show me a way to get the ID of the last inserted or updated row of a mysql DB when using PHP to handle the inserts/updates. Currently I have something like this, where column3 is a unique key, and there's also an id column that's an autoincremented primary key: $query ="INSERT INTO TABLE (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE SET column1=value1, column2=value2, column3=value3";
mysql_query($query);

$my_id = mysql_insert_id();
 $my_id is correct on INSERT, but incorrect when it's updating a row (ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE). I have seen several posts with people advising that you use something like INSERT INTO table (a) VALUES (0) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id) 
 to get a valid ID value when the ON DUPLICATE KEY is invoked-- but will this return that valid ID to the PHP mysql_insert_id() function?
@CODE:$query ="INSERT INTO TABLE (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE SET column1=value1, column2=value2, column3=value3";

@TITLE:Implementing a voting system without requiring registration
@CONTENT:I'd like to implement a voting system on my site, without having to force them to create an account. They would ultimately be voting up/down a piece of content which has a unique ID. I know that I could store entries in a table with IP/ID, but what if there are more than one user coming from the same IP? Is there a way to uniquely identify visitors without it being tied to their external ip? If created a GUID, store it in a cookie on that machine, could it be retrieved later on that same computer with the same IP? A different IP? Any thoughts on these questions, or any insight to a better approach would be greatly appreciated.

@TITLE:Never delete entries? Good idea? Usual?
@CONTENT:I am designing a system and I don't think it's a good idea to give the ability to the end user to delete entries in the database. I think that way because often then end user, once given admin rights, might end up making a mess in the database and then turn to me to fix it. Of course, they will need to be able to do remove entries or at least think that they did if they are set as admin. So, I was thinking that all the entries in the database should have an "active" field. If they try to remove an entry, it will just set the flag to "false" or something similar. Then there will be some kind of super admin that would be my company's team who could change this field. I already saw that in another company I worked for, but I was wondering if it was a good idea. I could just make regular database backups and then roll back if they commit an error and adding this field would add some complexity to all the queries. What do you think? Should I do it that way? Do you use this kind of trick in your applications?

@TITLE:How to reduce size of SQL Server table that grew from a datatype change
@CONTENT:I have a table on SQL Server 2005 that was about 4gb in size. (about 17 million records) I changed one of the fields from datatype char(30) to char(60) (there are in total 25 fields most of which are char(10) so the amount of char space adds up to about 300) This caused the table to double in size (over 9gb) I then changed the char(60) to varchar(60) and then ran a function to cut extra whitespace out of the data (so as to reduce the average length of the data in the field to about 15) This did not reduce the table size. Shrinking the database did not help either. Short of actually recreating the table structure and copying the data over (that's 17 million records!) is there a less drastic way of getting the size back down again?

@TITLE:Error using PHP cURL with SSL certificates
@CONTENT:I'm trying to write a PHP script using cURL that can authorize a user through a page that uses an SSL certificate, in addition to username and password, and I can't seem to get past the SSL cert stage. In this case, curl_setopt($handle, CURLOPT_VERIFYPEER, 0) unfortunately isn't an option. The certificate is a required part of authentication, otherwise I get the error mentioned in this other similar SO post. I've tried a few command-line runs with cURL: > curl --url https://website This returns the (60) SLL certificate problem error. If I adjust the command to include the --cacert option: > curl --url https://website --cacert /path/to/servercert.cer It works just fine; the auth website is returned. However, I've tried the following PHP code: $handle = curl_init();
$options = array( 
                  CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => false,
                  CURLOPT_HEADER         => true,
                  CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION => false,
                  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => '0',
                  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => '1',
                  CURLOPT_CAINFO         => '/path/to/servercert.cer',
                  CURLOPT_USERAGENT      => 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)',
                  CURLOPT_VERBOSE        => true,
                  CURLOPT_URL            => 'https://website'
           );

curl_setopt_array($handle, $options);
curl_exec($handle);
if (curl_errno($handle)) {
  echo 'Error: ' . curl_error($handle);
}
curl_close($handle);
 I would have thought the code was essentially analogous to the shell commands, but instead I'm greeted with the following error message: Error: error setting certificate verify locations: CAfile: /path/to/servercert.cer CApath: none I've read all the literature I can find (particularly on php.net and curl.haxx) and can't seem to find anything that fixes this problem. Any suggestions? EDIT: I have tried chmod 777 servercert.cer with no success. However, in executing the PHP script with the above code from the command line instead of the browser via php test.php, it works perfectly. Any explanation for why it doesn't work in the browser? EDIT 2: These drive-by downvotes on the only souls brave enough to answer this question are getting old. Either contribute something meaningful or pass on by, please.

I need to compare a user-provided string against the whole database and retrieve an identical string if it exists or otherwise return the closest fuzzy match(es) (60% similarity or better). The search time should ideally be under one second. My idea is to use edit distance for comparing each db string to the search string after narrowing down the candidates from the db based on their length. However, as I will need to perform this operation very often, I'm thinking about building an index of the db strings to keep in memory and query the index, not the db directly. Any ideas on how to approach this problem differently or how to build the in-memory index?

@TITLE:Font weight turns lighter on Mac/Safari
@CONTENT:On my last website, the text is perfect naturally on chrome and firefox without touching font-smoothing or anything else. But on Mac / Safari 7 the text appears well then turns immediately thinner (too much thinner / not nice to read). After doing some research [cf http://www.usabilitypost.com/2012/11/05/stop-fixing-font-smoothing/] and some tests playing with -webkit-font-smoothing    
 It looks like Safari display the text first with : -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;
 Then just after you got the flickering effect, when it is turning font to : -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
 So it seems to me that I had no choice but to force -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;
 to make my website consistent on all browsers. I am using font-face Avenir Std Roman. Some explanations to that Safari problem ? Any better solutions ? Could my font be part of the problem ? Thanks.

@TITLE:ASP.Net Identity how to set target DB?
@CONTENT:I am using the ASP.NET Identity Sample from the Asp-Team, and i am trying to change the database for the IdentityDbContext... I tried it with the constructor public MyDbContext() : base("MyConnectionString") { } // base is IdentityDbContext
 like with a DbContext class. That works well until i try to Register a User... await IdentityStore.CreateLocalUser(user, model.Password)
 returns false... no error, nothing. Any ideas how to fix that? Edit: Filename is Models\AppModel.cs, there is the MyDbContext class originally it was public class MyDbContext : IdentityDbContext<MyUser, UserClaim, UserSecret, UserLogin, Role, UserRole>
{
}
 i changed it to public class MyDbContext : IdentityDbContext<MyUser, UserClaim, UserSecret, UserLogin, Role, UserRole>
{
    public MyDbContext() : base("MyConnectionString") { }
}
 the connection string is working because i have other projects using the same, and they run fine. <connectionStrings>

@TITLE:Windows Azure SQL Database - Identity Auto increment column skips values
@CONTENT:Currently working on an ASP.Net MVC 4 application using Entity Framework 5. Used CodeFirst for initial development phase. But have now disabled the Automatic Migrations and designing new tables directly using SSMS and writing POCO. Everything is working good. Recently, identified a weird issue in Production. The records in one of the initially designed tables skipped auto-increment identity value by more than 900 numbers. This has happened 3 times within last 3 months. Debugged the application locally but could not reproduce. There isn't any pattern or trend observed. Model: public class Enquiry
{
    [Key]
    [DatabaseGeneratedAttribute(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
    public Int64 EnquiryId { get; set; }

 All this code has been working fine so far except the identity value getting skipped sporadically by large gaps of almost 1000 numbers. Has anybody come across such kind of issue? Please share your thoughts.

@TITLE:Error inflating class fragment - duplicate id/illegalargumentexception?
@CONTENT:I'm trying make an app that I'm building take a search term from the main activity, return results, and then have the results be clickable such that a detail could be viewed from each results. I'm doing this by using a MainActivity, a ResultsActivity, and PlaceActivity and then a ListFragmentClickable (which extends ListFragment). If the handset is oriented in portrait mode, the results list should be viewable, with the details being viewed only if a result is clicked. If the handset is landscape, a detail window should pop up to the right of the list when an item is selected. At runtime, I get an error that reads "error inflating class fragment". I have no idea what is causing it, and I'd love help in getting rid of it. My ListFragmentClickables are called by my ResultsActivity, which is here: public class ResultsActivity extends FragmentActivity implements ListFragmentClickable.OnItemSelectedListener{

private ArrayAdapter<String> mAdapter;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_results_view);

    //Receive searchTerm from MainActivity
    Intent intent = getIntent();
    String searchTerm = intent.getStringExtra(MainActivity.SEARCH_TERM);

    mAdapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, R.layout.item_label_list);

    FragmentManager     fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
    FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();

    FactualResponderFragment responder = (FactualResponderFragment) fm.findFragmentByTag("RESTResponder");
    if (responder == null) {
        responder = new FactualResponderFragment();
        ft.add(responder, "RESTResponder");
    }

    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putString("search_term", searchTerm);
    responder.setArguments(bundle);

    ft.commit();
}

public ArrayAdapter<String> getArrayAdapter() {
    return mAdapter;
}

@Override //creates a DetailFragment when a list item is selected
public void onItemSelected(String link) {
    DetailFragment fragment = (DetailFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.detailFragment);
    if (fragment != null && fragment.isInLayout()) {
          fragment.setText(link);
    } else {
      Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), PlaceActivity.class);
          intent.putExtra(PlaceActivity.EXTRA_URL, link);
      startActivity(intent);
    }
}
 } Here's the ListFragmentClickable class: public class ListFragmentClickable extends ListFragment{

  private OnItemSelectedListener listener;


  public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) { 
      View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.activity_results_view, container, false);
      return view;
  }

  @Override
      public void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) {
          updateDetail(); //see bottom
      }

  public interface OnItemSelectedListener {
      public void onItemSelected(String link);
  }

  @Override
  public void onAttach(Activity activity) {
      super.onAttach(activity);
      if (activity instanceof OnItemSelectedListener) {
          listener = (OnItemSelectedListener) activity;
      } else {
          throw new ClassCastException(activity.toString()
            + " must implemenet ListFragmentClickable.OnItemSelectedListener");
      }
  }


 public void updateDetail() {
        // Create fake data
    String newTime = String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    // Send data to Activity
    listener.onItemSelected(newTime); //should direct PlaceActivity!!
  }
}
 Here's my layout file for the ResultsActivity (activity_results_activity.xml): <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"

@TITLE:Why ASP.NET MVC default Model Binder is slow? It's taking a long time to do its work
@CONTENT:In a current project the client asked for the possibility of answering a questionnaire in two ways: using a Wizard (one question at a time) and Listing (all questions at once) in a single form. Both ways are already implemented. The questions are loaded from the database per Manual's chapter using AJAX (this is super fast). The biggest chapter at the moment has 230 questions (each with 4 HTML input fields - input/text, select, etc). If the user selects such Chapter to answer in the Listing format, the <form> will contain at about 920 fields to be posted to the server. I'm doing an AJAX POST request passing the data with jQuery's serialize method: data: $("#questions :input").serialize()
 This serialization takes 207.143ms to complete. I got this value debugging with Firebug in Firefox: console.profile();
$("#questions :input").serialize();
console.profileEnd();
 Again this is super fast... The problem comes when hydrating the data received on the following action method: public async Task<ActionResult> ListSaveAsync(IEnumerable<AnswerViewModel> questions)
 As you see, the posted data is data bound to an IEnumerable<AnswerViewModel> questions. AnswerViewModel has only 4 fields to store each answer. The thing is that it takes a considerable amount of time (precisely 10 seconds) after clicking the Save button to hit a breakpoint on this action method, that is, those 10 seconds are being spent in the model binder presumably. An important thing to mention is that I'm using Steve Sanderson's @Html.BeginCollectionItem helper to help when materializing the ViewModel collection properties from the HTTP POST. See how the data gets in the ViewModel (Keys): Do you know what I can try to do to optimize this? I thought about 4 workarounds: Save back only the modified questions. To do this I'd need to store each answer value in a data-attribute when loading the listing and compare it with the actual value when submitting the <form> as this guy suggests here. Create AnswerViewModel JavaScript objects on the client side and pass them to the action method. Would this alleviate the Model Binder? Roll my own model binder... but I really don't know if it would be faster than the default one that comes with ASP.NET MVC. From what I've read the default model binder does a lot of reflection to set the values/hydrate the action's model parameter and this could be the bottleneck. Use FormCollection and enumerate through the posted data getting each value by key and performing validation manually as shown here. What else do you suggest? Update 1 I went with option 3 and implemented a custom Model Binder: AnswerModelBinder : IModelBinder and used it in that specific action method: public async Task<ActionResult> ListSaveAsync(
             [ModelBinder(typeof(AnswerModelBinder))]List<AnswerViewModel> questions)
 Now what took 10 seconds to complete takes only 2 seconds. Looks like the default model binder validation checks [ ModelState ] has a big impact on performance. Update 2 I just experienced it once again: having a List<Guid> as an action parameter and passing only 59 strings through a $.getJson call was taking ~3 seconds to hit a breakpoint in the 1st line of the action method. Changing the parameter type to List<string> made the whole thingy work in the blink of an eye. An interesting fact is that inside the action method I did this: List<Guid> userIds = resources.Select(Guid.Parse).ToList();
 and it transforms the resources List<string> to a List<Guid> instantaneously. For sure there's something buggy with ASP.NET model binder. I just would like to know what it is... :)

@TITLE:Zooming UIImageView inside UIScrollView with autolayout
@CONTENT:I have a UIImageView embedded inside a UIScrollView, prior to iOS 6 and autolayout I used the following snippet inside the controller's viedDidLoad method to display a scrollable and zoomable image. self.scrollView.contentSize = self.imageView.image.size;
self.imageView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.imageView.image.size.width, self.imageView.image.size.height);
 But now the constraints set in the storyboard are used instead. I've found this question Embed ImageView in ScrollView with Auto Layout on iOS 6 and some others here in SO stating that constraints are loaded/enforced after viewDidLoad, and that moving my previous snippet to viewDidAppear would fix this issue but zooming does not work properly and it seems that the sizes of the scrollView and the imageView are reset to the storyboard's constraint after a pinch-to-zoom gesture. I'm just guessing, but I think maybe if there's some way to override the scrollView's and imageView's vertical and horizontal space constraints in code that might work. Anyone else having this issues?

@TITLE:ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord when using ActiveAdmin and Friendly_id
@CONTENT:I started using ActiveAdmin recently in a project and almost everything works great but I'm having a problem when using it in combination with the friendly_id gem. I'm getting ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord thrown for my forms [i believe] because of the friendly_id attribute whose ID is readonly: {"utf8"=>"??",
"_method"=>"put",
"authenticity_token"=>"Rc5PmUYZt3BiLvfPQr8iCPPXlbfgjoe/n+NhCwXazNs=",
"space"=>{"name"=>"The Kosmonaut",
"address"=>"8 Sichovykh Striltsiv 24",
"email"=>"info@somedomain.com"},
"commit"=>"Update Space",
"id"=>"the-kosmonaut"}  <--- culprit
 I'm guessing the last line is the culprit as it's a readonly attribute, it's not in my form but rather in the PATH http://localhost:5000/manage/spaces/the-kosmonaut/edit How can I fix this from trying to update the ID? Form from in ActiveAdmin looks like this:   form do |f|
    f.inputs "Details" do
      f.input :name
      f.input :address
      f.input :email
      f.input :phone
      f.input :website
    end
    f.inputs "Content" do
      f.input :description
      f.input :blurb
    end
    f.buttons
  end
 UPDATE: This doesn't work either so it's not the friendly_id? I tried using @watson's suggestion which should have worked but still got the same error ;-( {"utf8"=>"??",
 "_method"=>"put",
 "authenticity_token"=>"Rc5PmUYZt3BiLvfPQr8iCPPXlbfgjoe/n+NhCwXazNs=",
 "space"=>{"name"=>"The Kosmonaut 23"},
 "commit"=>"Update Space",
 "id"=>"6933"}
 http://localhost:5000/manage/spaces/6933/edit When I check the record in the console with record.readonly? it returns false UPDATE UPDATE: removing the scope_to fixes the problem. scope_to :current_user, :unless => proc{ current_user.admin? }
 Only problem is I need the scope_to to prevent users from seeing records they do not own. My guess is (as I'm assuming scope_to normally works with has_many) that my HABTM association causes some weirdness? Ie Users <-- HABTM --> Spaces?

@TITLE:Disable Cleartype (text anti-aliasing) in IE9
@CONTENT:It's well documented (e.g. here) that IE9 ignores the OS-wide settings for font smoothing (aka anti-aliasing). Even if font-smoothing and ClearType are disabled in Windows, IE still shows anti-aliased fonts, which some users struggle to read, especially at small font sizes. How can I disable all font anti-aliasing (ClearType or otherwise) in IE9? More details: Our company builds a web application which uses a lot of small fonts. With the release of IE9, some of our users have complained that IE9's default anti-aliasing makes our small fonts fuzzy or blurry. So we need to help our users who've installed IE9 and who want to turn off anti-aliasing. Also, personally, I have trouble reading small, anti-aliased fonts, so I'd like a solution for my own use, even for sites I don't control. In IE8 I could uncheck the "Always use ClearType for HTML" and then disable ClearType in the OS and IE8 would show all fonts aliased. But in IE9, this option is missing. After some research about the problem, here's what I've learned: the core issue is that IE relies on DirectWrite for text rendering and does not support any of the newer rendering options which would draw text without anti-aliasing and respect the user's OS-wide default choices. Making things worse, if you disable ClearType in the OS, in some cases IE will fall back to DirectWrite's default non-cleartype anti-aliasing which is even fuzzier than ClearType.

@TITLE:How to handle OpenSSL SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ / WANT_WRITE on non-blocking sockets
@CONTENT:The OpenSSL library allows to read from an underlying socket with SSL_read and write to it with SSL_write. These functions maybe return with SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE depending on their ssl protocol needs (for example when renegotiating a connection). I don't really understand what the API wants me to do with these results. Imaging a server app that accepts client connections, sets up a new ssl session, makes the underlying socket non-blocking and then adds the filedescriptor to a select/poll/epoll loop. If a client sends data, the main loop will dispatch this to a ssl_read. What has to be done here if SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE is returned? WANT_READ might be easy, because the next main loop iteration could just lead to another ssl_read. But if the ssl_read return WANT_WRITE, with what parameters should it be called? And why doesn't the library issue the call itself? If the server wants to send a client some data, it will use ssl_write. Again, what is to be done if WANT_READ or WANT_WRITE are returned? Can the WANT_WRITE be answered by repeating the very same call that just was invoked? And if WANT_READ is returned, should one return to the main loop and let the select/poll/epoll take care of this? But what about the message that should be written in the first place? Or should the read be done right after the failed write? Then, what protects against reading bytes from the application protocol and then having to deal with it somewhere in the outskirts of the app, when the real parser sits in the mainloop?

I think the problem can probably be solved by using opensource NLP libraries but its obviously more complicated than simple part of speech tagging. So if someone can instead tell the algorithm for it by using an existing opensource NLP library, that would be good too. Also let me know if you know a library/toolkit that uses data mining to solve this problem. Although it will be difficult to get sufficient data for training purposes, I will be able to use stack exchange data for training.

@TITLE:Improving pure Python prime sieve by recurrence formula
@CONTENT:I am trying to optimize further the champion solution in prime number thread by taking out the complex formula for sub-list length. len() of the same subsequence is too slow as len is expensive and generating the subsequence is expensive. This looks to slightly speed up the function but I could not yet take away the division, though I do the division only inside the condition statement. Of course I could try to simplify the length calculation by taking out the optimization of starting marking for n instead of n*n... I replaced division / by integer division // to be compatible with Python 3 or from __future__ import division
 Also I would be interesting if this recurrence formula could help to speed up the numpy solution, but I have not experience of using numpy much. If you enable psyco for the code, the story becomes completely different, however and Atkins sieve code becomes faster than this special slicing technique. import cProfile

@TITLE:WIX: Giving Permissions to a folder
@CONTENT:I've read all related topics and haven't found a full answer to my problem. I would like to give full permissions to SYSTEM and Read & Execute permissions to Users group to a folder under Program Files. Nothing more, nothing less. I know there are 3 ways to give permissions to a folder using WIX, none of them are really good for me and I'll explain why: 1) Regular Permission element:     <CreateFolder Directory="Test">
      <Permission User="SYSTEM" GenericAll="yes"/>
      <Permission User="Users" Domain="[LOCAL_MACHINE_NAME]" 
      GenericRead="yes" Read="yes" GenericExecute="yes" ChangePermission="yes"/>
    </CreateFolder>
 Problem: It fails on foreign OS since it doesn't knows the "Users" keyword. I tried it with SID as well. Beside that I need to place the Permission element under each file in the Test directory (but if this was the only case, I would have managed) 2) WixUtilsExtension PermissionEx element:     <CreateFolder Directory="Test">
      <util:PermissionEx User="SYSTEM" GenericAll="yes"/>
      <util:PermissionEx User="Users" Domain="[LOCAL_MACHINE_NAME]" 
      GenericRead="yes" Read="yes" GenericExecute="yes" ChangePermission="yes"/>
    </CreateFolder>
 Problem: The folder also keeps the default permissions of the Program Files folder. I can not allow that. 3) PermissionEx with Sddl: Problem: This element is only available when installing with MSI 5.0. I'm using installer 3.01. I'll be happy to get any solution, including solutions with custom actions...
@CODE:<CreateFolder Directory="Test">

@TITLE:trigger config transformation in TFS 2010 or msbuild
@CONTENT:I'm attempting to make use of configuration transformations in a continuous integration environment. I need a way to tell the TFS build agent to perform the transformations. I was kind of hoping it would just work after discovering the config transform files (web.qa-release.config, web.production-release.config, etc...). But it doesn't. I have a TFS build definition that builds the right configurations (qa-release, production-release, etc...) and I have some specific .proj files that get built within these definitions and those contain some environment specific parameters eg: <PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)'=='production-release' ">
    <TargetHost Condition=" '$(TargetHost)'=='' ">qa.web</TargetHost>

<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)'=='qa-release' ">

 I know from the output that the correct configurations are being built. Now I just need to learn how to trigger the config transformations. Is there some hocus pocus that I can add to the final .proj in the build to kick off the transform and blow away the individual transform files?

@TITLE:Superscript / subscript in hyperlink in WPF
@CONTENT:I'm trying to make a Hyperlink that contains text with super- and/or subscripts. I've found two ways to do this, and both of them suck. Solution #1: use Typography.Variants. This gives a terrific superscript... for some fonts. <StackPanel>
  <TextBlock FontFamily="Palatino Linotype" FontSize="30">
    <Hyperlink>R<Run Typography.Variants="Superscript">2</Run></Hyperlink>
    (Palatino Linotype)
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock FontFamily="Segoe UI" FontSize="30">
    <Hyperlink>R<Run Typography.Variants="Superscript">2</Run></Hyperlink>
    (Segoe UI)
  </TextBlock>
</StackPanel>
 Looks beautiful in Palatino Linotype; but for fonts that don't support variants, it's simply ignored, no emulation is done, and the text is full-size, at-baseline, 100% normal. I would prefer to allow my end-users to select the font they want to use, and still have super/subscripts work. Solution #2: use BaselineAlignment. This raises or lowers the text appropriately, though unlike solution #1, I have to decrease the font size manually. Still, it's effective for all fonts. The problem is the Hyperlink's underline. <TextBlock FontSize="30" FontFamily="Palatino Linotype">
  <Hyperlink>
    R<Run BaselineAlignment="Superscript" FontSize="12pt">2</Run>
  </Hyperlink>
</TextBlock>
 The underline is raised and lowered along with the text, which looks pretty wretched. I'd rather have a continuous, unbroken underline under the whole Hyperlink. (And before anyone suggests a Border, I'd also like the Hyperlink to be able to word-wrap, with all of the words underlined, including the first row.) Is there any way to make superscript and subscript work in WPF, in any font, without looking laughably bad when underlined?

@TITLE:Programatically disable/enable network interface
@CONTENT:I'm trying to come up with a solution to programatically enable/disable the network card - I've done a ton of research and nothing seems to be a workable solution in both XP and Vista environments. What I'm talking about is if you went into the Control Panel 'Network Connections', right clicked on one and picked either enable or disable. Ideally I'd like to use a library, but if worse comes to worse I supposed I could call out to a commandline app, but that's absolute worst case. Here's what I've tried so far and where/why they failed: This previous post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83756/how-to-programmatically-enabledisable-network-interfaces-windows-xp Lists a couple of methods - the first is using netsh, which appears to be the same as using the IPHelper function SetIfEntry(). The problem with this is that it sets the interface as Administratively enabled or disable, not the normal enabled/disabled so it doesn't actually shut down the NIC. Another solution proposed is using WMI and in particular Win32_NetworkAdapter class, which has an Enable and Disable method: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394216(VS.85).aspx Great right? Works fine in Vista, those methods don't exist in a normal XP install... Another suggestion is to use DevCon, which really uses the SetupAPI, in particular SetupDiSetClassInstallParams() with the DICS_ENABLE. After spending countless hours with this wonderful class, and trying to disable/enable the device both at the global level as well as the specific configuration level (and every combination), it doesn't consistently work either - sometimes working fine, but other times disabling the device in the Device Manager, but still leaving it up and operational in the Network Connections. I then tried using the INetConnection interface, specifically INetConnection->Connect/Disconnect: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365084(VS.85).aspx But I was never able to get this to have any effect on the connections on either my Vista or XP test boxes. Finally, I found this C# script called ToggleNic: http://channel9.msdn.com/playground/Sandbox/154712/ Which looks like it's going through the Shell somehow to effectively cause the right-click behavior. The limitation (at least of this implementation) is that it doesn't work (without modification) on non-English systems, which I need mine to work with. To be fair, this solution looks like the most viable, but my familiarity with C# is low and I couldn't find if the API it's using is available in C++. Any help or insights would be greatly appreciated - or ideas on how to accomplish what the togglenic script does in C++. Thanks!

Also, why do we gain on performance if instead of doing a = b / c
 we do d = 1 / c
a = b * d
 ? Edit: Basically I was asking because someone asked me to distribute a value among contenders based on the assignment of weights. I did all this in integers and was later asked to convert to float, which caused a slowdown in performance. I was just interested in knowing how would C or C++ do these operations that would cause the slowness.

@CONTENT:I have a VS2008 application that includes a service project (I'll call it ServiceProject). I have the installation project (InstallationProject) set to RemovePreviousVersions. Additionally, I have Custom Actions set for InstallationProject, to Install, Commit, Rollback, and Uninstall the Primary output from ServiceProject. Sometimes when I build new versions of the installer, I can install without an error. Often, when I get to the point of setting up the service (entering a username and password into the installer) - it fails with the error, "The specified service already exists". I don't know why it's inconsistent, though I've considered that maybe there is some kind of signature for the service and if the service is unmodified, it is able to remove it successfully, but with modifications, it doesn't recognize the service. However, I rarely make modifications to the service, so I doubt that's it. How can I make my installer successfully update the service without this error? My work-around is to manually go into Control Panel, uninstall the former application, then run the installer.

@TITLE:HtmlAgilityPack Drops Option End Tags
@CONTENT:I am using HtmlAgilityPack. I create an HtmlDocument and LoadHtml with the following string: <select id="foo_Bar" name="foo.Bar"><option selected="selected" value="1">One</option><option value="2">Two</option></select>
 This does some unexpected things. First, it gives two parser errors, EndTagNotRequired. Second, the select node has 4 children - two for the option tags and two more for the inner text of the option tags. Last, the OuterHtml is like this: <select id="foo_Bar" name="foo.Bar"><option selected="selected" value="1">One<option value="2">Two</select>
 So basically it is deciding for me to drop the closing tags on the options. Let's leave aside for a moment whether it is proper and desirable to do that. I am using HtmlAgilityPack to test HTML generation code, so I don't want it to make any decision for me or give any errors unless the HTML is truly malformed.

/user/user_id/items/
/user/user_id/items/item_id
 CRUD on each if makes sense. For example, /user POST creates a new user, GET fetches all users. /user/user_id GET fetches just that one user. Items are user specific so I put them under user_id, which is a particular user. Now to make Express routing modular I made a few router instances. There is a router for user, and a router for the item. var userRouter = require('express').Router();
userRouter.route('/')
  .get(function() {})
  .post(function() {})
userRouter.route('/:user_id')
  .get(function() {})

var itemRouter = require('express').Router();
itemRouter.route('/')
  .get(function() {})
  .post(function() {})
itemRouter.route('/:item_id')
  .get(function() {})

app.use('/users', userRouter);

// Now how to add the next router?
// app.use('/users/', itemRouter);
 URL to item is descendents of the URL hierarchy of the user. Now how do I get URL with /users whatever to userRouter but the more specific route of /user/*user_id*/items/ to the itemRouter? And also, I would like user_id to be accessible to itemRouter as well, if possible.

 But in chrome when I make a POST request I get the Not Allowed error: My request looks like this: var request = $.ajax({
            async: true,
            url: apiEndpoint + 'api/login',

            contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
            dataType: 'json'
        })
 apiEndpoint is on localhost but on a different port - the client and api projects are in different solutions. The POST request eventually makes its way to the server, but I always get an error related to OPTIONS and I never get a cookie saved to the client because of it. I spent the last couple hours trying to get CORS with WebAPI working: https://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=CORS%20support%20for%20ASP.NET%20Web%20API But some assembly versioning issues led to me yanking everything out - hopefully there's a simpler solution.

@LINK:/questions/16992339/why-is-postgresql-array-access-so-much-faster-in-c-than-in-pl-pgsql
@TITLE:Why is PostgreSQL array access so much faster in C than in PL/pgSQL?
@CONTENT:I have a table schema which includes an int array column, and a custom aggregate function which sums the array contents. In other words, given the following: CREATE TABLE foo (stuff INT[]);

INSERT INTO foo VALUES ({ 1, 2, 3 });
INSERT INTO foo VALUES ({ 4, 5, 6 });
 I need a "sum" function that would return { 5, 7, 9 }. The PL/pgSQL version, which works correctly, is as follows: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION array_add(array1 int[], array2 int[]) RETURNS int[] AS $$
DECLARE
    result int[] := ARRAY[]::integer[];
    l int;
BEGIN
  ---
  --- First check if either input is NULL, and return the other if it is
  ---
  IF array1 IS NULL OR array1 = '{}' THEN
    RETURN array2;
  ELSEIF array2 IS NULL OR array2 = '{}' THEN
    RETURN array1;
  END IF;

  l := array_upper(array2, 1);

  SELECT array_agg(array1[i] + array2[i]) FROM generate_series(1, l) i INTO result;

  RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
 Coupled with: CREATE AGGREGATE sum (int[])
(
    sfunc = array_add,
    stype = int[]
);
 With a data set of about 150,000 rows, SELECT SUM(stuff) takes over 15 seconds to complete. I then re-wrote this function in C, as follows: #include <postgres.h>
#include <fmgr.h>
#include <utils/array.h>

Datum array_add(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS);
PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(array_add);

/**
 * Returns the sum of two int arrays.
 */
Datum
array_add(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
  // The formal PostgreSQL array objects:
  ArrayType *array1, *array2;

  // The array element types (should always be INT4OID):
  Oid arrayElementType1, arrayElementType2;

  // The array element type widths (should always be 4):
  int16 arrayElementTypeWidth1, arrayElementTypeWidth2;

  // The array element type "is passed by value" flags (not used, should always be true):
  bool arrayElementTypeByValue1, arrayElementTypeByValue2;

  // The array element type alignment codes (not used):
  char arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode1, arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode2;

  // The array contents, as PostgreSQL "datum" objects:
  Datum *arrayContent1, *arrayContent2;

  // List of "is null" flags for the array contents:
  bool *arrayNullFlags1, *arrayNullFlags2;

  // The size of each array:
  int arrayLength1, arrayLength2;

  Datum* sumContent;
  int i;
  ArrayType* resultArray;


  // Extract the PostgreSQL arrays from the parameters passed to this function call.
  array1 = PG_GETARG_ARRAYTYPE_P(0);
  array2 = PG_GETARG_ARRAYTYPE_P(1);

  // Determine the array element types.
  arrayElementType1 = ARR_ELEMTYPE(array1);
  get_typlenbyvalalign(arrayElementType1, &arrayElementTypeWidth1, &arrayElementTypeByValue1, &arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode1);
  arrayElementType2 = ARR_ELEMTYPE(array2);
  get_typlenbyvalalign(arrayElementType2, &arrayElementTypeWidth2, &arrayElementTypeByValue2, &arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode2);

  // Extract the array contents (as Datum objects).
  deconstruct_array(array1, arrayElementType1, arrayElementTypeWidth1, arrayElementTypeByValue1, arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode1,
&arrayContent1, &arrayNullFlags1, &arrayLength1);
  deconstruct_array(array2, arrayElementType2, arrayElementTypeWidth2, arrayElementTypeByValue2, arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode2,
&arrayContent2, &arrayNullFlags2, &arrayLength2);

  // Create a new array of sum results (as Datum objects).
  sumContent = palloc(sizeof(Datum) * arrayLength1);

  // Generate the sums.
  for (i = 0; i < arrayLength1; i++)
  {
    sumContent[i] = arrayContent1[i] + arrayContent2[i];
  }

  // Wrap the sums in a new PostgreSQL array object.
  resultArray = construct_array(sumContent, arrayLength1, arrayElementType1, arrayElementTypeWidth1, arrayElementTypeByValue1, arrayElementTypeAlignmentCode1);

  // Return the final PostgreSQL array object.
  PG_RETURN_ARRAYTYPE_P(resultArray);
}
 This version takes only 800 ms to complete, which is.... much better. (Converted to a stand-alone extension here: https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode/tree/master/postgresql/array_sum) My question is, why is the C version so much faster? I expected an improvement, but 20x seems a bit much. What's going on? Is there something inherently slow about accessing arrays in PL/pgSQL? I'm running PostgreSQL 9.0.2, on Fedora Core 8 64-bit. The machine is a High-Memory Quadruple Extra-Large EC2 instance.

@TITLE:Error with ggplot2 mapping variable to y and using stat=bin
@CONTENT:I am using ggplot2 to make a histogram: geom_histogram(aes(x=...), y="..ncount../sum(..ncount..)")
 and I get the error: Mapping a variable to y and also using stat="bin".
  With stat="bin", it will attempt to set the y value to the count of cases in each group.
  This can result in unexpected behavior and will not be allowed in a future version of ggplot2.
  If you want y to represent counts of cases, use stat="bin" and don't map a variable to y.
  If you want y to represent values in the data, use stat="identity".
  See ?geom_bar for examples. (Deprecated; last used in version 0.9.2)
 What causes this in general? I am confused about the error because I'm not mapping a variable to y, just histogram-ing x and would like the height of the histogram bar to represent a normalized fraction of the data (such that all the bar heights together sum to 100% of the data.) edit: if I want to make a density plot geom_density instead of geom_histogram, do I use ..ncount../sum(..ncount..) or ..scaled..? I'm unclear about what ..scaled.. does.

@TITLE:When is doubly linked list more efficient than singly linked list?
@CONTENT:In an interview today I got asked the question. Apart from answering reversing the list and both forward and backward traversal there was something "fundamental" in it that the interviewer kept stressing. I gave up and of course after interview did a bit of research. It seems that insertion and deletion are more efficient in doubly linked list than singly linked list. I am not quite sure how it can be more efficient for a doubly linked list since it is obvious that more references are required to change. Can anybody explain the secret behind? I honestly did a quite a bit of research and failed to understand with my main trouble being the fact that a O(n) searching is still needed for the double linked list.

@TITLE:Dynamically serving a matplotlib image to the web using python
@CONTENT:This question has been asked in a similar way here but the answer was way over my head (I'm super new to python and web development) so I'm hoping there's a simpler way or it could be explained differently. I'm trying to generate an image using matplotlib and serve it without first writing a file to the server. My code is probably kind of silly, but it goes like this: import cgi
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
import cStringIO #I think I will need this but not sure how to use

...a bunch of matplotlib stuff happens....
pyplot.savefig('test.png')

print "Content-type: text/html\n"
print """<html><body>
...a bunch of text and html here...
<img src="test.png"></img>
...more text and html...
</body></html>
"""
 I think that instead of doing pyplot.savefig('test.png'), I am supposed to create a cstringIO object and then do something like this: mybuffer=cStringIO.StringIO()
pyplot.savefig(mybuffer, format="png")
 But I am pretty lost from there. All the examples I've seen (e.g. http://lost-theory.org/python/dynamicimg.html) involve doing something like print "Content-type: image/png\n"
 and I don't get how to integrate that with the HTML I'm already outputting.
@CODE:import cgi
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
import cStringIO #I think I will need this but not sure how to use

...a bunch of matplotlib stuff happens....
pyplot.savefig('test.png')

print "Content-type: text/html\n"
print """<html><body>
...a bunch of text and html here...
<img src="test.png"></img>

            InnerException: 
 It appears that the server has closed the connection prematurely due to inactivity on the connection. If I instead give a pulse to the server, even one byte at a time, then I never get this exception and I can continue to transfer data indefinitely. I've constructed a very simple example application to demonstrate this which uses basicHttpBinding with Streamed transferMode and I insert an artificial delay from within a custom stream implementation on the client that delays for 130 seconds. This simulates something similar to a buffer under-run condition in which the stream provided in my service call from the client is not feeding the data to the WCF infrastructure quick enough to satisfy some sort of unidentifiable timeout value that appears to be around the 130 second mark. Using the WCF service tracing tools I'm able to find an HttpException with the a message that reads "The client is disconnected because the underlying request has been completed. There is no longer an HttpContext available." From the IIS Express trace log file I see an entry that says "The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request. (0x800703e3)" I've configured both server and client timeouts to use a value well over the 130 second mark just to rule them out. I've tried idleTimeout in IIS Express and a host of ASP.NET related timeout values too in order to discover where this issue is coming from but so far no luck. The best information I can find so far is a comment in the FireFox issue tracker by a developer that describes a similar problem working outside of the WCF architecture. For this reason I'm guessing the issue may be more related specifically to IIS7 or possibly Windows Server. Custom binding on server Web.config <binding name="myHttpBindingConfiguration"
         closeTimeout="02:00:00"
         openTimeout="02:00:00"
         receiveTimeout="02:00:00"
         sendTimeout="02:00:00">

    binding.MaxReceivedMessageSize = _maxReceivedMessageSize;
    binding.MaxBufferSize = 65536;

 In response to wals idea to try to see if I get any different results by self hosting my service I want to add that I did so and found that I get the same results as when hosting in IIS. What does this mean? My guess is that this means the issue is either in WCF or in the underlying networking infrastructure in Windows. I'm using Windows 7 64 bit and we've discovered this issue by running various clients and running the service portion on a Windows 2008 Server. Update 2013-01-15 I found some new clues thanks to DarkWanderer once I realized that WCF uses HTTP.sys underneath in self-hosting scenarios on Windows 7. This got me looking into what I could configure for HTTP.sys and also what type of issues people are reporting that for HTTP.sys that sound similar to what I'm experiencing. This lead me to a log file located at C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR\httperr1.log which appears to log specific types of HTTP issues on the part of HTTP.sys. In this log I see the following type of log entry each time I run my test. 2013-01-15 17:17:12 127.0.0.1 59111 127.0.0.1 52733 HTTP/1.1 POST /StreamingService.svc - - Timer_EntityBody - So it's down to finding what conditions could cause a Timer_EntityBody error and what settings in IIS7 or elsewhere may have a bearing on when and if that error occurs. From the official IIS webiste: The connection expired before the request entity body arrived. When it is clear that a request has an entity body, the HTTP API turns on the Timer_EntityBody timer. Initially, the limit of this timer is set to the connectionTimeout value. Each time another data indication is received on this request, the HTTP API resets the timer to give the connection more minutes as specified in the connectionTimeout attribute. Trying to modify the connectionTimeout attribute as the reference above suggests for in applicationhost.config for IIS Express doesn't seem to make any difference. Perhaps IIS Express ignores this configuration and uses a hard coded value internally? Trying something on my own I discovered that there are new netsh http commands added to show and add timeout values so giving that I go I came up with the following command but unfortunately doing so didn't seem to have any effect on this error either. netsh http add timeout timeouttype=IdleConnectionTimeout value=300

@TITLE:Android UnsatisfiedLinkError with OpenCV 2.4.2
@CONTENT:just trying to do a simple openCV android program. Downloaded and installed OpenCV for Android following the instructions here and added the OpenCV Library 2.4.2 as a library project for my own android project like the instructions state. However when I compile the standard "Hello World Program", as follows, it fails if I include the Mat mat = new Mat(); line, but succeeds otherwise. package com.example;

import org.opencv.core.Mat;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class HelloAndroidActivity extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        Mat mat = new Mat();
    }
}
 Here's the stack trace it prints out:     07-23 09:59:43.835: E/AndroidRuntime(8222): FATAL EXCEPTION: main

 Two things to note: I am not directly using anything native in this code (like some other questions on here) and the old OpenCV 2.3.x library worked just fine before using the same method. Both Android projects have the same target and supported API settings.

@TITLE:OpenMP performance
@CONTENT:Firstly, I know this [type of] question is frequently asked, so let me preface this by saying I've read as much as I can, and I still don't know what the deal is. I've parallelized a massive outer for loop. Number of loop iterations varies, typically between 20-150, but the loop body does a huge amount of work, calling on a lot of local intensive linear algebra routines (as in, the code is part of the source and not an external dependency). Within the loop body there is 1000+ calls to these routines, but they're all totally independent of one another, so I figured it would be a prime candidate for parallelism. The loop code is C++, but it calls a lot of subroutines written in C. Code looks like this; <declare and initialize shared variables here>
#ifdef _OPENMP
#pragma omp parallel for                            \
  private(....)\
  shared(....)              \
  firstprivate(....) schedule(runtime)
#endif
  for(tst = 0; tst < ntest; tst++) {

     // Lots of functionality (science!)
     // Calls to other deep functions which manipulate private variables only
     // Call to function which has 1000 loop iterations doing matrix manipulation
     // With no exaggeration, there are probably millions 
     // of for-loop iterations in this body, in the various functions called. 
     // They also do lots of mallocing and freeing
     // Finally generated some calculated_values

     shared_array1[tst] = calculated_value1;
     shared_array2[tst] = calculated_value2;
     shared_array3[tst] = calculated_value3;

 } // end of parallel and for

// final tidy up
 There shouldn't, I believe, be any synchronization at all - the only time the threads access a shared variable are the shared_arrays, and they access unique points in those arrays, indexed by tst. Thing is, when I up the number of threads (on a multicore cluster!) The speeds we're seeing (where we invoke this loop 5 times) are as follows;               Elapsed time   System time
 Serial:        188.149          1.031
 2 thrds:       148.542          6.788
 4 thrds:       309.586        424.037       # SAY WHAT?
 8 thrds:       230.290        568.166  
16 thrds:       219.133        799.780 
 Things which may be noticeable are the massive jump in System time between 2 and 4 threads, and the fact the elapsed time doubles as we move from 2 to 4, and then slowly decreases. I've tried with a huge range of OMP_SCHEDULE parameters but no luck. Is this related to the fact each thread is using malloc/new and free/delete a lot? This has consistently been run with 8GBs memory - but I'm guessing that's not a problem. Frankly, the huge rise in system time makes it look like the threads might be blocking, but I have no idea why that would happen. UPDATE 1 I really thought the false sharing was going to be the problem, so re-wrote the code so that the loops store their calculated values in thread-local arrays, and then copy these arrays across to the shared array at the end. Sadly this didn't have any impact, though I almost don't believe it myself. Following @cmeerw's advice, I ran strace -f, and after all the initialization there are just millions of lines of [pid 58067] futex(0x35ca58bb40, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1 <unfinished ...>

 Anyone have any ideas what means? Looks like the threads are context switching way too often, or just blocking and unblocking? When I strace the same implementation with OMP_NUM_THREADS set to 0 I get none of this at all. For some comparison, the logfile generated when 1 thread is used is 486 KB , and the log file generated when 4 threads are used is 266 MB. In other words, the parallel version invokes an extra 4170104 lines of log file... UPDATE 2 As suggested by Tom, I tried binding threads to specific processors to no avail. We're in OpenMP 3.1, so I set the environment variable using export OMP_PROC_BIND=true. Same size logfile and same timeframe. UPDATE 3 The plot thickens. Having only profiled on the cluster so far, I installed GNU GCC 4.7 via Macports and compiled (with openMP) on my Macbook for the first time (Apple's GCC-4.2.1 throws up a compiler bug when OpenMP is enabled, which is why I hadn't compiled and run it in parallel locally until now). On the Macbook, you see basically the trend you'd expect                 C-code time
 Serial:         ~34 seconds
 2 thrds:        ~21 seconds
 4 thrds:        ~14 seconds
 8 thrds:        ~12 seconds
16 thrds:         ~9 seconds
 We see dimishing returns towards the ends, though this is hardly surprising as a couple of the data sets we're iterating over on this test data have <16 members (so, we're generating 16 threads for, say a for-loop with 7 iterations). So, now the question remains - WHY does the cluster's performance degrade so badly. I'm going to try on a different quadcore linuxbox tonight. The cluster compiles with GNU-GCC 4.6.3, but I can't believe that in itself is going to make such a difference? Neither ltrace nor GDB are installed on the cluster (and I can't get them on for various reasons). If my linuxbox gives cluster-like performance I'll run the corresponding ltrace analysis there. UPDATE 4 Oh my. I duel booted my Macbook Pro into Ubuntu (12.04) and re-ran the code. It all runs (which is somewhat reassuring) but I see the same, weird bad-performance behavior I see on the clusters, and the same run of millions of futex calls. Given the only difference between my local machine in Ubuntu and in OSX is software (and I'm using the same compiler and libraries - presumably there aren't different glibc implementations for OSX and Ubuntu!) I'm now wondering if this is something to do with how Linux schedules/distributes threads. Any case, being on my local machine makes everything a million times easier, so I'm going to go ahead and ltrace -f it and see what I can find. I wrote a work around for the clusters which forks() off a separate process, and gives a perfect 1/2 in the runtime, so it's definitely possible to get the parallelism going...

 How can I make that so when I click on the #myelement one more time (when the element is showed already) it will hide the #another-element like this: $('#another-element').hide("slide", { direction: "right" }, 1000);? So basicly, it should work exactly like a slideToggle but with the show/hide functions. Is that possible?

@TITLE:Using Dropbox API to upload a file with Android
@CONTENT:How can I upload a File (graphic, audio and video file) with Android using the Dropbox API to Dropbox? I followed the tutorial on the Dropbox SDK Android page and could get the sample to work. But now instead of a String I want to upload an actual File object and am struggling. The sample code works without any problems and looks like this:     String fileContents = "Hello World!";
ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(fileContents.getBytes());
try {
    Entry newEntry = mDBApi.putFile("/testing_123456.txt", inputStream, fileContents.length(), null, null);
} catch (DropboxUnlinkedException e) {
    Log.e("DbExampleLog", "User has unlinked.");
} catch (DropboxException e) {
    Log.e("DbExampleLog", "Something went wrong while uploading.");
}   
 But when I try to change it and upload an actual file with this code:     File tmpFile = new File(fullPath, "IMG_2012-03-12_10-22-09_thumb.jpg");

// convert File to byte[]
ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);
oos.writeObject(tmpFile);
bos.close();
oos.close();
byte[] bytes = bos.toByteArray();

ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);
try {
    Entry newEntry = mDBApi.putFile("/IMG_2012-03-12_10-22-09_thumb.jpg", inputStream, tmpFile.length(), null, null);
} catch (DropboxUnlinkedException e) {
    Log.e("DbExampleLog", "User has unlinked.");
} catch (DropboxException e) {
    Log.e("DbExampleLog", "Something went wrong while uploading.");
}
 I have no success getting a DropboxException error. I think something where I try to convert the File object to the byte-stream must be wrong but this is just an assumption. Other than the String example there is nothing else documented on the Dropbox page for Android. Thanks for any help.
@CODE:String fileContents = "Hello World!";

@LINK:/questions/8785459/anonymous-table-or-varray-type-in-oracle
@TITLE:Anonymous TABLE or VARRAY type in Oracle
@CONTENT:In Oracle, I would sometimes like to create constructs such as these ones SELECT * FROM TABLE(STRINGS('a', 'b', 'c'))
SELECT * FROM TABLE(NUMBERS(1, 2, 3))
 Obviously, I can declare my own types for the above. I can choose between TABLE and VARRAY. For example: CREATE TYPE STRINGS AS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(100);
CREATE TYPE NUMBERS AS VARRAY(100) OF NUMBER(10);
 In this particular case, another solution is to write things like SELECT 'a' FROM DUAL UNION ALL
SELECT 'b' FROM DUAL UNION ALL
SELECT 'c' FROM DUAL
 But I may have more complex examples where I will really need a TABLE / VARRAY type. So what if my SQL is running on an unknown system where I cannot create types because I may not have the necessary grants? So my question is: Does Oracle know "anonymous" TABLE / VARRAY types that are available on any Oracle instance? Similar to Postgres / H2 / HSQLDB's simple ARRAY types? UPDATE: I am mostly running this SQL from Java, if this is relevant. No need to explain PL/SQL to me, I'm really just looking for anonymous SQL array types (i.e. "anonymous" standalone stored types). If they don't exist at all, the answer is NO
@CODE:SELECT * FROM TABLE(STRINGS('a', 'b', 'c'))
SELECT * FROM TABLE(NUMBERS(1, 2, 3)) TABLE VARRAY CREATE TYPE STRINGS AS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(100);
CREATE TYPE NUMBERS AS VARRAY(100) OF NUMBER(10); SELECT 'a' FROM DUAL UNION ALL
SELECT 'b' FROM DUAL UNION ALL
SELECT 'c' FROM DUAL TABLE VARRAY TABLE VARRAY ARRAY

A retry after a short delay is all that is needed, but when it occurs, I would like to report the process that prevented the access. Is it feasible when a sharing violation occurs for my program to enumerate all the file handles in use, inspect the filename, and if it matches the name of my data file, retrieves the process name associated with that handle?

Now the problem is in paging related stuff.I am able to stop paging by detecting childs inside the viewpager according to this thread android: ViewPager and HorizontalScrollVIew, but how can I can enable that back when user touches outside of that view. I have used following code for CustomViewPager. public class CustomViewPager extends ViewPager {

        private boolean enabled;
        private int childId;

        }

        @Override

            this.enabled = enabled;
        }

@CONTENT:I'm having a similar issue to The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot support operations that write to the log file, but I have a follow-up question. The answer there references Using TRY...CATCH in Transact-SQL, which I'll come back to in a second... My code (inherited, of course) has the simplified form: SET NOCOUNT ON

END CATCH

RETURN 0
 I think I have enough information to just play with it and figure it out myself... unfortunately reproducing the error is proving damn near impossible. So I'm hoping that asking here will help clarify my understanding of the problem and solution. This stored procedure is, intermittently, throwing errors like this one: error importing results for backtest 9649 error_number: 3930 error_message: The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot support operations that write to the log file. Roll back the transaction. error_severity: 16 error_state 1 error_line: 217 So obviously the error is coming from the 2nd catch block Based on what I've read in Using TRY...CATCH in Transact-SQL, I think what's happening is that when the exception is thrown, the use of XACT_ABORT is causing the transaction to be "terminated and rolled back"... and then the first line of the BEGIN CATCH is blindly attempting to roll back again. I don't know why the original developer enabled XACT_ABORT, so I'm thinking the better solution (than removing it) would be to use XACT_STATE() to only roll back if there is a transaction (<>0). Does that sound reasonable? Am I missing something? Also, the mention of logging in the error message makes me wonder: Is there another problem, potentially with configuration? Is our use of RAISEERROR() in this scenario contributing to the problem? Does that get logged, in some sort of case where logging isn't possible, as the error message alludes to?

@TITLE:How can Mac OS X games receive low-level keyboard input events?
@CONTENT:Games need low-level access to keyboard input. On Windows, there's DirectInput. But what technology do Mac OS X game developers use? Obviously, there's enough Mac games which get keyboard input just right, without the drawbacks of the commonly known solutions: Solution #1: Use keyUp / keyDown events -(void)keyUp:(NSEvent*)event;
-(void)keyDown:(NSEvent*)event;
 Inacceptable drawback: keyDown events are repeated based on the system preference settings for "key repeat rate" and "key repeat delay". This causes an initial keyDown event followed by a pause before it starts repeating at a rate defined by a system preference setting. This solution can not be used for continuous key events. I wonder if the key repeat behavior can be disabled? I suppose that you could read the first keyDown key, then remember the "key with keyCode x is down" state in your class until the keyUp event is received for that key, thus bypassing the repeat delay and repeat rate issues. Solution #2: Use Quarts Event Taps See Quartz Event Services Reference. It seems to be sufficiently low-level. Inacceptable drawback: requires Assistive Devices to be enabled in system preferences under Universal Access - Keyboard. While this may be on by default, there is no guarantee that it might be turned off on some systems. I also read that Quartz event taps require the app to run as root, but found no confirmation for this. Solution #3: Carbon Events / IOKit HID The Carbon Event Manager Reference is marked as legacy and should not be used for new development. Inacceptable Drawback: no one knows how long the Carbon events will continue to be supported in future Mac OS versions. Apart from Carbon being a legacy framework, this still seems to be the best solution. But are there any other drawbacks for using Carbon Events? Questions: Which technology do Mac OS X game developers use for receiving low-level keyboard input events? If they use one of the above technologies, how do they work around the drawbacks I mentioned? UPDATE: I eventually turned to using the regular NSEvent messages and wrapped them in a neat API for polling the keyboard states.

 the getMaxCapacity() function return number entered * 30 for now; Here is the scenario when 1: I paste 3, it will not change (i still see the alert) 2: Then when i paste 5, it will be 90(3 * 30) 3: Then if i paste 10 it will be 150(5 * 30), and so on.

Is there any advice that I need to know about when setting this up to run on IIS? A guy from work said that my web application MUST be in the wwwroot directory for IIS to work properly. My understanding of this is that if I created a virtual directory (web application can then be in any directory) then I should be ok? Also, are there decent books that I can purchase that can help me in understanding IIS better? This does not have to be specific to ASP.NET MVC. The only thing that I know how to do in IIS is to create a virtual directory :) How would I then debug the application when it is running in IIS?

Whilst the quality of the designs I create with CSS is subjective, much of the coding is purely functional / layout and I am interested in any way to automate the testing of my page. My question can be split into two parts Does anyone have any existing techniques or suggestions for automatically testing CSS or HTML, particularly with regard cross-browser compatibility? As CSS can be roughly divided into properties that control layout and those that control design, is automated testing only viable for layout (it can't be possible to automatically and valuably test that a colour is correct, for example)? If so, what sort of CSS values might be suitable for boolean acceptance tests? Here are my initial examples of boolean layout values that could be tested - there must be others? Does a pop-up appear above other content (z-index) Does a footer clear all other content (float) Thanks for your help.

@CONTENT:The scene: A purchased web application, with regular updates from the vendor. We then, heavily customize the look and sometimes add our own functionality or fix a bug before the vendor gets to it. For version control, we have been using Subversion following their Vendor Branch model each time we received a new release. This has the added benefit that we have a, version controlled, vanilla copy of their system. The problem: We would like to switch to Mercurial and will likely follow the stable/default branching pattern. Mercurial makes perfect sense if we were to only receive a single release from our vendor and start developing it from there. But, for whatever reason, I am having trouble wrapping my mind around how to handle future releases from the vendor.

@CONTENT:i looked at the example on http://solitarygeek.com/java/developing-a-simple-java-application-with-spring/comment-page-1#comment-1639 because i'm just getting started with spring. And, i'm trying to figure out why the service layer is needed in the first place in the example he provides. if you took it out, then in your client, you could just do: UserDao userDao = new UserDaoImpl();
Iterator users = userDao.getUsers();
while (K) {
K
}
 It seems like the service layer is simply a wrapper around the DAO. Can someone give me a case where things could get messy if the service layer were removed? I just dont see the point in having the service layer to begin with. thanks!

@TITLE:Hide StatusBar from MPMoviePlayerController
@CONTENT:I've been struggling with a very annoying problem all day long and I hope I could find help on this board. I'm using an MPMoviePlayerController to play a fullscreen movie on iPad and I can't figure how to remove the status bar which is always displayed despite all my efforts to make it go to hell. Here is the code of the method I use to display the movie : -(void)launchVideoFromButton:(id)sender{

         NSString *videoPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"movie01" ofType:@"m4v"];
         NSURL *videoPathURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:videoPath];
         moviePlayer = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:videoPathURL];

         [self.view addSubview:moviePlayer.view];

         moviePlayer.shouldAutoplay = YES;
         moviePlayer.movieSourceType = MPMovieSourceTypeFile;


         [moviePlayer setFullscreen:YES animated:YES];
         moviePlayer.controlStyle = MPMovieControlStyleFullscreen;

         NSNotificationCenter *notificationCenter = [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter];
         [notificationCenter addObserver:self selector:@selector(moviePlayerEvent:) name:MPMoviePlayerLoadStateDidChangeNotification object:moviePlayer];

    }



    -(void)moviePlayerEvent:(NSNotification*)aNotification{

         [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation:NO];
         NSLog(@"%i", [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarHidden);

    }
 In the console, I can see that moviePlayerEvent is fired when the movie appears but the statusbar is still there : [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation:NO] seems to be inoperant. I've been trying to use the other MPMoviePlayerController notifications with no luck. Could anyone help me on that one? Thanks in advance.

Having an ORM with no Poco support, e.g. mappings are done with attributes like the DataObjects.Net Orm, is not an issue for me, as also with Poco-supported Orms and theirs generated proxy entities, you have to be aware that entities are actually DAO objects bound to some context/session, e.g. serializing is a problem, etc..

@TITLE:Filtering by entity key name in Google App Engine on Python
@CONTENT:On Google App Engine to query the data store with Python, one can use GQL or Entity.all() and then filter it. So for example these are equivalent gql = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE age >= 18"
db.GqlQuery(gql)
 and query = User.all()
query.filter("age >=", 18)
 Now, it's also possible to query things by key name. I know that in GQL you do it like this gql = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE __key__ >= Key('User', 'abc')"
db.GqlQuery(gql)
 But how would you now use filter to do the same? query = User.all()
query.filter("__key__ >=", ?????)
@CODE:gql = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE age >= 18"
db.GqlQuery(gql) query = User.all()
query.filter("age >=", 18) gql = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE __key__ >= Key('User', 'abc')"
db.GqlQuery(gql) query = User.all()

 and all(a.count(char) == b.count(char) for char in a)
 but the first one is slower when (for example) the first char of a is nowhere in b, and the second is slower when they are actually permutations. Is there any better (either in the sense of more Pythonic, or in the sense of faster on average) way to do it?

As an example, lets say there are 100 images on a page and that these images are named "01.jpg", "02.jpg", "03.jpg", etc. If image "42.jpg" is replaced, is there any way to replace it in the cache so that "42.jpg" will automatically display the new image on successive page loads? I can't use the META tag method, because I need everuthing that ISN"T replaced to remain cached, and I can't use the timestamp method, because I don't want ALL of the images to be reloaded every time the page loads. I've racked my brain and scoured the Internet for a way to do this (preferrably via javascript), but no luck. Any suggestions?

@LINK:/questions/26385984/recursive-pattern-in-regex
@TITLE:Recursive pattern in regex
@CONTENT:This is very much related to Regular Expression to match outer brackets however, I specifically want to know how or whether it's possible to do this regex's recursive pattern? I'm yet to find a python example using this strategy so think this ought to be a useful question! I've seen some claims that recursive patterns can be used to match balanced parenthesis, but no examples using python's regex package (Note: re does not support recursive pattern, you need to use regex). One claim is that syntax is b(?:m|(?R))*e where: b is what begins the construct, m is what can occur in the middle of the construct, and e is what can occur at the end of the construct I want to extract matches for the outer braces in the following: "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}"
["1, {2, 3}", "4, 5"]  # desired
 Note that this is easy to do the same for inner braces: re.findall(r"{([^{}]*)}", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")
['2, 3', '4, 5']
 (In my example I was using finditer (over match objects), see here.) So I had hoped that the following, or some variation, would work: regex.findall(r"{(:[^{}]*|?R)}", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")
regex.findall(r"({(:[^{}]*|?R)})", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")
regex.findall(r"({(:.*|(?R))*})", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")
regex.findall(r"({(:.*)|(?R)*})", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")
regex.findall(r"({(:[^{}])|(?R)})", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")
 but I'm scuppered by either [] or error: too much backtracking. Is it possible to extract match objects for the outer parenthesis using regex's recursion? Obviously, I run the risk of being shot down with: don't parse html with regex do this with pyparse write a proper lexer & parser e.g. using ply I want to emphasis this is about how to use the recursive pattern (which if my understanding is correct, takes us outside of regular language parsing, so may can actually be possible!). If it can be done, this ought to be a cleaner solution.
@CODE:b(?:m|(?R))*e b m e "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}"
["1, {2, 3}", "4, 5"]  # desired re.findall(r"{([^{}]*)}", "{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}")

@TITLE:Laravel 4 CSRF form submit through Ajax call
@CONTENT:I'm new to both Stackoverflow and Laravel 4, I am trying to submit a form through jquery ajax. I serializeArray() the form and use json to submit it. In laravel, in the routes I check the csrf token submitted, the go to my controller for process inputs. The csrf check doesn't work when the _token input is in an array as with serializeArray(). I have to get the _token value and submit is as a seperate ajax data. I'm wondering if there is a way to tell csrf filter where ever its running to check the input array for hte field _token and use that? here is my code: routes.php Route::post('searchAjax', array('before' => 'csrf', 
                                'uses' => 'SearchController@searchAjax'));
 This is where I wan't it to read the array form[0]['_token] but I don't know how to tell it to do that. index.js
    var form = $('#search').serializeArray();
var token = $('#search > input[name="_token"]').val();
$.ajax({
    type: 'post',
    url: 'searchAjax',
    dataType: 'json',
    data: { _token: token, form: form },

            //alert(key)
        }
        //alert(data.message);
    }
});
 I want to get rid of { _token: token, form: form } in the ajax call and just have 'form' that is an array with _token in it already. here is the html: <form id="search" class="form-horizontal" accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://testing:998/search" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" value="6GBbv9LmnOdL8UcOsm8DDJ4Bfi6eGcQRlC9SPdL4" name="_token">

@TITLE:explicit type casting example in java
@CONTENT:I have come across this example on http://www.javabeginner.com/learn-java/java-object-typecasting and in the part where it talks about explicit type casting there is one example which confuses me. The example: class Vehicle {

    String name;
    Vehicle() {
        name = "Vehicle";
    }
}

class HeavyVehicle extends Vehicle {

    HeavyVehicle() {
        name = "HeavyVehicle";
    }
}

class Truck extends HeavyVehicle {

    Truck() {
        name = "Truck";
    }
}

class LightVehicle extends Vehicle {

    LightVehicle() {
        name = "LightVehicle";
    }
}

public class InstanceOfExample {

    static boolean result;
    static HeavyVehicle hV = new HeavyVehicle();
    static Truck T = new Truck();
    static HeavyVehicle hv2 = null;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        result = hV instanceof HeavyVehicle;
        System.out.print("hV is an HeavyVehicle: " + result + "\n");
        result = T instanceof HeavyVehicle;
        System.out.print("T is an HeavyVehicle: " + result + "\n");
        result = hV instanceof Truck;
        System.out.print("hV is a Truck: " + result + "\n");
        result = hv2 instanceof HeavyVehicle;
        System.out.print("hv2 is an HeavyVehicle: " + result + "\n");
        hV = T; //Sucessful Cast form child to parent
        T = (Truck) hV; //Sucessful Explicit Cast form parent to child
    }
}
 In the last line where T is assigned the reference hV and typecast as (Truck), why does it say in the comment that this is a Successful Explicit Cast from parent to child? As I understand casting (implicit or explicit) will only change the declared type of object, not the actual type (which shouldn't ever change, unless you actually assign a new class instance to that object's field reference). If hv was already assigned an instance of a HeavyVehicle class which is a super class of the Truck class, how can then this field be type cast into a more specific subclass called Truck which extends from the HeavyVehicle class? The way I understand it is that casting serves the purpose of limiting access to certain methods of an object (class instance). Therefore you can't cast an object as a more specific class which has more methods then the object's actual assigned class. That means that the object can only be cast as a superclass or the same class as the class from which it was actually instantiated. Is this correct or am I wrong here? I am still learning so I am not sure if this is the correct way of looking at things. I also understand that this should be an example of downcasting, but I am not sure how this actually works if the actual type doesn't have the methods of the class to which this object is being downcasted. Does explicit casting somehow change the actual type of object (not just the declared type), so that this object is no longer an instance of HeavyVehicle class but now becomes an instance of Truck class?
@CODE:class Vehicle {

    String name;
    Vehicle() {
        name = "Vehicle";
    }
}

class HeavyVehicle extends Vehicle {

    HeavyVehicle() {
        name = "HeavyVehicle";
    }
}

class Truck extends HeavyVehicle {

    Truck() {
        name = "Truck";
    }
}

class LightVehicle extends Vehicle {

    LightVehicle() {
        name = "LightVehicle";
    }
}

public class InstanceOfExample {

    static boolean result;
    static HeavyVehicle hV = new HeavyVehicle();
    static Truck T = new Truck();
    static HeavyVehicle hv2 = null;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        result = hV instanceof HeavyVehicle;
        System.out.print("hV is an HeavyVehicle: " + result + "\n");
        result = T instanceof HeavyVehicle;
        System.out.print("T is an HeavyVehicle: " + result + "\n");
        result = hV instanceof Truck;
        System.out.print("hV is a Truck: " + result + "\n");
        result = hv2 instanceof HeavyVehicle;
        System.out.print("hv2 is an HeavyVehicle: " + result + "\n");
        hV = T; //Sucessful Cast form child to parent
        T = (Truck) hV; //Sucessful Explicit Cast form parent to child

@TITLE:Proximity sensor on Galaxy S4 (Air Gestures)
@CONTENT:The new Samsung Galaxy S4 have and interesting new type of gestures called "Air Gesture" that use an infrared sensor to process users hand movement in front of the screen, adding a "pre-touch"/"proximity" event, in wich the fingers are detected before the touch. I'd like to use this "Floating Touch" event in one of my apps. I searched both on Google and in the Samsung Developers Center, but I coudnt find any API or information about that. Are the API available or is too early? Does someone have any link/info? http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxys4/lifetask.html#page=airview
