@TITLE:Scroll a new item in a ItemsControl into view
@CONTENT:I have an ItemsControl that is databound to a ObservableCollection. I have this method in the code behind which adds a new model to the list. I would then like to scroll the new item (at the bottom of the list) into view. I think the size of the ItemsControl is not yet updated when I am querying the size, since the ActualHeight before and after the addition of the model is the same. The effect of this code is to scroll to a point slightly above the new item. How would I know what the new ActualHeight is going to be? Here is my code:         ViewModel.CreateNewChapter();
        var height = DocumentElements.ActualHeight;
        var width = DocumentElements.ActualWidth;
        DocumentElements.BringIntoView(new Rect(0, height - 1, width, 1));
@CODE:ItemsControl ObservableCollection ItemsControl ActualHeight ActualHeight ViewModel.CreateNewChapter();
        var height = DocumentElements.ActualHeight;
        var width = DocumentElements.ActualWidth;

@TITLE:Need authoritative source for why you shouldn't throw or catch java.lang.Exception
@CONTENT:I've got a coding standards meeting in just over an hour and I need a quick answer to this one. Common wisdom among experienced Java programmers is that you don't throw or catch java.lang.Exception (with rare exceptions - no pun intended). The reason you don't do this is that the statement catch (java.lang.Exception ex) {...}
 will also catch unchecked Exceptions, and in most cases this is not what is intended. We already have a lot of legacy code written by existing team members where they catch a subclass of java.lang.Exception, log an error, and rethrow the subclass as java.lang.Exception. I need to convince them that They need to stop writing code like this. Existing code that uses this anti-pattern needs to be fixed Number 2 means a fair amount of refactoring. It will shorten the argument at the meeting if I can show an article or blog entry by one of the Java community heavyweights that makes this point (i.e. Joshua Bloch, James Gosling). My google-fu hasn't turned up anything so far. Does anyone know of an article or blog by a respected Java guru that says that you shouldn't throw or catch java.lang.Exception? Quick answers are much appreciated. Dean

@TITLE:When to use brackets and when to use the period in Objective-C
@CONTENT:I'm a new iPhone/Objective-C developer and as I'm going through different tutorials and open source code, I am having a bit of a problem understanding when to use the square brackets "[ ]" and when to use the period " . " for accessing properties/methods of an object. For example, this code: - (void)setSelected:(BOOL)selected animated:(BOOL)animated {

  [super setSelected:selected animated:animated];

  UIColor *backgroundColor = nil;
  if (selected){
    backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
  } else {
    backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

  self.todoTextLabel.highlighted = selected;
  self.todoTextLabel.opaque = !selected;

  self.todoPriorityLabel.backgroundColor = backgroundColor;
  self.todoPriorityLabel.highlighted = selected;
  self.todoPriorityLabel.opaque = !selected;
}
 Why does [UIColor clearColor] get brackets, but todoTextLabel.backgroundColor get the period? Could someone explain this easily for me?
@CODE:- (void)setSelected:(BOOL)selected animated:(BOOL)animated {

  [super setSelected:selected animated:animated];

  UIColor *backgroundColor = nil;

@TITLE:What the best way to get paragraphs in a WPF textblock? (newline chars?)
@CONTENT:I have some text which has "\r\n" newline markers. I would like to have the newlines in a WPF textblock. I've tried replacing "\r\n" with "& # 13;" (without the spaces), which worked when I set the Text property in XAML, but doesn't seem to work when setting from the C# code-behind. So...what's the standard way to convert "\r\n" to newlines in a WPF textblock? Thx in advance!

It works fine, but in terms of coding can anyone confirm that it's a reasonable way to go?         //  assign the message, replacing "\r\n" with WPF line breaks
        string[] splitter = new string[] { "\r\n" };

@TITLE:Am I using the right approach to monitor the tasks I want to perform when a handle is created?
@CONTENT:Is there a generally-accepted best practice for creating an event handler that unsubscribes itself? E.g., the first thing I came up with is something like: // Foo.cs

// ...
Bar bar = new Bar(/* add'l req'd state */);
EventHandler handler = new EventHandler(bar.HandlerMethod);

bar.HandlerToUnsubscribe = handler;

eventSource.EventName += handler;
// ...
 // Bar.cs

class Bar
{
    /* add'l req'd state */

    // .ctor

    public EventHandler HandlerToUnsubscribe { get; set; }

    public void HandlerMethod(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        // Do what must be done w/ add'l req'd state
        ((EventSourceType)sender).EventName -= this.HandlerToUnsubscribe;
    }
}
 To say that this feels hackish/bad is an understatement. It's tightly coupled with a temporal dependency (HandlerToUnsubscribe must be assigned the exact value at the exact right time). I feel like I must be playing the part of a complicator in this case--- is there something stupid or simple that I'm missing? Context: I'm creating a binding between the UI and a proprietary commanding infrastructure in Winforms (using the useful ICommand in System.Windows.Input). One aspect of the binding infrastructure is that users who create a binding between a UI command component (like a toolbar button or menu item) have the option to listen to the command's CanExecuteChanged event and then update the UI's state based on that-- typically setting the Enabled property to true or false. The technique generally works quite well, but there are ways for the event to be fired prior to a ui component's handle having been created. I'm trying to guarantee that the provided handler isn't run unless the handle has been created. Resultantly, I'm considering providing a general helper class ("Bar") that will aid implementation. The goal of Bar is to check to see if the appropriate handle exists. If so, great! If not, it will subscribe to appropriate IsHandleCreated event so that the supplied handlers get run when the handle eventually is created. (This is important b/c the client may set their bindings in the UI's .ctor, before a handle exists.) I want this subscription to be completely transparent, however, and so I also want each event handler to automatically unsubscribe itself from IsHandleCreated once it's finished running. I'm still at a point where I'm trying to figure out if this is a good idea, so I haven't generalized the concept yet-- I've only implemented it directly against ToolStripItems in this case to verify that the idea is sound. I'm not sold on it yet, though. I understand that I also have the option of simply mandating that bindings can only be created once the UI's handle has been created, in the OnLoad event of a form (e.g.). I know that can work, I've done it in the past. I'd like to see if I can ease that particular requirement in this case though. If it's even practical.
@CODE:// Foo.cs

// ...
Bar bar = new Bar(/* add'l req'd state */);
EventHandler handler = new EventHandler(bar.HandlerMethod);

bar.HandlerToUnsubscribe = handler;

eventSource.EventName += handler;
// ... // Bar.cs

class Bar
{
    /* add'l req'd state */

    // .ctor

    public EventHandler HandlerToUnsubscribe { get; set; }

    public void HandlerMethod(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        // Do what must be done w/ add'l req'd state
        ((EventSourceType)sender).EventName -= this.HandlerToUnsubscribe;
    }
} HandlerToUnsubscribe ICommand CanExecuteChanged true false Bar Bar IsHandleCreated IsHandleCreated

@TITLE:Passing Multiple Json Objects as data using jQuery's $.ajax()
@CONTENT:I am POSTing data to an MVC controller and I'm attempting to maintain state as well for optimistic concurrency. I'm currently posting back a JSON request, but would be open to workable alternatives? I am already posting a name/value collection with the following command: $.ajax({
    url: g_appPath + "/Rounding.aspx/Round/" + $("#OfferId").val(),
    type: 'POST',
    dataType: 'html',
    data: $.toJSON(data), // <-- data = name/value array

    success: doSubmitSuccess
});
 I also have an (encrypted) array of id's and timestamps that I want to pass back so the server can decrypt it, then validate that data is still fresh before it saves it. It is very important that the data object are separate and are not a child of one or the other or in a wrapper array (because of reflective deserialization at the server end). It is also important to note that I want to do this asynchronously and not as a form submit. My question is: Is there any way I can post back 2 JSON objects using 'application/json' as the content type? My other question is: Is there a better / another way I could be doing this? thanks in advance! UPDATE: I solved my problem, by changing the contentType parameter to default and instead sending the stringified ajax data as separate named parameters in the querystring. When you use contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8', this pushes the data into the body of the request, rather than the querystring. My new $.ajax() post now looks like this: $.ajax({
    url: g_appPath + "/Rounding.aspx/Round/" + $("#OfferId").val(),
    type: 'POST',
    dataType: 'html',
    data: "RoundingData=" + $.toJSON(data) + "&StateData=" + $.toJSON(stateData),
    // --removed! contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
    beforeSend: doSubmitBeforeSend,
    complete: doSubmitComplete,
    success: doSubmitSuccess
});
 This question really arose because of my inexperience with this type of data operation, and I hope someone looking for this in the future might stumble across this. thanks! Dan

@TITLE:How to print a NSInteger value from an NSManagedObject using NSLog
@CONTENT:When I try to print an integer value to the console that is retrieved from an NSManagedObject, it displays a 6 or 8 digit value (the object ID?). However, if I use the debugger 'Print Description to Console' is shows up as the single digit value I expect. For example, I assign the object 'sequence' to an NSInteger and then display using an NSLog format string: MyProcess *myProcess = [array objectAtIndex:i];
NSInteger sequence = [[NSNumber numberWithInteger:(NSInteger)myProcess.sequence] intValue];
NSLog(@"sequence = %d",myProcess.sequence);
 Console output is: 2009-10-06 16:11:05.871 MyProcess[33185:20b] sequence = 565256
 But when I try 'Print to Console' from the debugger, I see the value 1: <MyStoryImage: 0x3f59a80> (entity: MyObject; id: 0x3f2d540 <x-coredata://FF21959A-  4B67-4587-A25F-66A7B8139DFA/MyProcess/p2> ; data: {
sequence = 1;
<x-coredata://FF21959A-4B67-4587-A25F-66A7B8139DFA/MyProcess/p1>;
})
 Your help is appreciated!

@TITLE:linux/gcc: ldd functionality from inside a C/C++ program
@CONTENT:Is there a simple and efficient way to know that a given dynamically linked ELF is missing a required .so for it to run, all from the inside of a C/C++ program? I need a program with somewhat similar functionality as ldd, without trying to execute the ELF to find out the (met/unmet) dependencies in the system. Perhaps asking the ld-linux.so utility via some library? (I'm a newbie in this part of linux =) NOTE: reading the source code of ldd was not very helpful for my intentions: it seems that ldd is in fact forking another process and executing the program. If it's not possible to know that a program has unmet dependencies without executing it, is there some way to, at least, quickly list the .so's required for that ELF all from within my program? Thanks in advance =)

@TITLE:How can I search multiple files for a string in Perl?
@CONTENT:My question is probably simple but I'm a complete newbie. I want to search the contents of multiple text files for a particular phrase and then display the lines of the finds on screen. I've already learnt how to deal with a single file. For example, if I want to search for a word, say "Okay" in a text file named "wyvern.txt" in the root directory of F. The following code works: #!/usr/bin/perl

$file = 'F:\wyvern.txt';
open(txt, $file);
while($line = <txt>) {
  print "$line" if $line =~ /Okay/;
}
close(txt);
 But what should I do if I want to search for the same phrase in two text files, say "wyvern' and "casanova" respectively? or how about all the files in the directory "novels" in the root directory of F. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance Mike Edit: Haha, I finally figured out how to search all the files in a directory for a pattern match:) The following code works great: #!/usr/bin/perl  
@files = <F:/novels/*>;
foreach $file (@files) {
open   (FILE, "$file");
while($line= <FILE> ){
print "$line" if $line =~ /Okay/;
}
close FILE; 
}
@CODE:#!/usr/bin/perl

$file = 'F:\wyvern.txt';
open(txt, $file);
while($line = <txt>) {
  print "$line" if $line =~ /Okay/;
}
close(txt); #!/usr/bin/perl  
@files = <F:/novels/*>;
foreach $file (@files) {
open   (FILE, "$file");
while($line= <FILE> ){
print "$line" if $line =~ /Okay/;
}
close FILE; 
} $file

@TITLE:visual studio 2008 crazy debugger skipping!
@CONTENT:What the hell could be causing this.... I'm developing my C# 3.5 ASP.NET MVC web app, same as I do all day every day. Not doing anything clever, just standard methods on classes calling other methods... I build my project, fire up a url in Chrome, and get the response I expect. I attach the debugger to w3wp.exe, set a breakpoint and f5 in Chrome. The debugger stops at the breakpoint as I'd expect.... I hit f11 to step through the code, and it will move to the next line/part line, do it a few times and it will randomly skip to an arbitrary line in the execution path!!! The line it skips to is a line that would have been executed, it doesn't skip to any old line, it just decides to miss out a whole bunch of lines in between??!!! I've never seen this before, how the hell do I debug what's going on??? For a while I thought perhaps Chrome is making two requests, and the debugger isnt really skipping, its just swapping between request threads making it look like its jumping about, but thats not it! If i set a breakpoint on every single line i can partially prevent it, but take the following: 1. public string Method()
2. {
3.     string s;
4.     s = OtherMethod();
5.     return s;
6. 
7. }
 the type of behaviour im seeing (with a breakpoint on every line above) is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (i.e. it wont step into OtherMethod(); Other behaviour im seeing is 1,2,3 and then thats it, off back to wherever called Method() or even further away :s Thanks
@CODE:1. public string Method()
2. {
3.     string s;
4.     s = OtherMethod();
5.     return s;

@LINK:/questions/1491037/mapping-stdmap-to-python
@TITLE:Mapping std::map to Python
@CONTENT:Sometimes it makes sense to have a key-ordered dictionary. In C++, this is often implemented with a Red-black tree. But any self-balancing binary search tree will do (fwiw, Knuth is particularly clear on this subject). The best solution I've been able to come up with so far is to take R. McGraw's AVL-tree type and create a wrapper class that basically implements the STL map interface (also counting on the handy ordering of pairs (two element tuples) in Python). Such a tuple basically corresponds to std::map::value_type. Yes, there's Python's bisect module, and while that is logarithmic at insertion time in the same way that self-balancing binary trees are logarithmic at insertion time (right?), frankly I just want an object. Called OrderedDict or something (and no, the Python 3.1 OrderedDict doesn't qualify -- that's for 'insertion-time' ordering -- and frankly what insertion-time ordering has to do with ordering is not quite obvious). Note, a key-ordered dictionary is highly useful in many industries (in finance for instance, it's ordinary to keep track of price books of data, which are basically ordered dictionaries of price -> quantity, aggregated order information, etc.). If anyone has any other ideas, that's great. All I know is I just got five million times smarter by Alex Martelli's 'answers' here. So I thought I'd ask.

@CONTENT:I am after a string format to efficiently represent a set of indices. For example "1-3,6,8-10,16" would produce [1,2,3,6,8,9,10,16] Ideally I would also be able to represent infinite sequences. Is there an existing standard way of doing this? Or a good library? Or can you propose your own format? thanks! Edit: Wow! - thanks for all the well considered responses. I agree I should use ':' instead. Any ideas about infinite lists? I was thinking of using "1.." to represent all positive numbers. The use case is for a shopping cart. For some products I need to restrict product sales to multiples of X, for others any positive number. So I am after a string format to represent this in the database.

@TITLE:Why is host aborting connection?
@CONTENT:I'm teaching myself Python networking, and I recalled that back when I was teaching myself threading, I came across this page, so I copied the scripts, updated them for Python 3.1.1 and ran them. They worked perfectly. Then I made a few modifications. My goal is to do something simple: The client pickles an integer and sends it to the server. The server receives the pickled integer, unpickles it, doubles it, then pickles it and sends it back to the client. The client receives the pickled (and doubled) integer, unpickles it, and outputs it. Here's the server: import pickle
import socket
import threading

class ClientThread(threading.Thread):
	def __init__(self, channel, details):
		self.channel = channel
		self.details = details
		threading.Thread.__init__ ( self )

	def run(self):
		print('Received connection:', self.details[0])
		request = self.channel.recv(1024)
		response = pickle.dumps(pickle.loads(request) * 2)
		self.channel.send(response)
		self.channel.close()
		print('Closed connection:', self.details [ 0 ])

server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind(('', 2727))
server.listen(5)

while True:
	channel, details = server.accept()
	ClientThread(channel, details).start()
 And here is the client: import pickle
import socket
import threading

class ConnectionThread(threading.Thread):
	def run(self):
		client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
		client.connect(('localhost', 2727))

		for x in range(10):
			client.send(pickle.dumps(x))
			print('Sent:',str(x))
			print('Received:',repr(pickle.loads(client.recv(1024))))

		client.close()

for x in range(5):
	ConnectionThread().start()
 The server runs fine, and when I run the client it successfully connects and starts sending integers and receiving them back doubled as expected. However, very quickly it exceptions out: Exception in thread Thread-2:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python30\lib\threading.py", line 507, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "C:\Users\Imagist\Desktop\server\client.py", line 13, in run
    print('Received:',repr(pickle.loads(client.recv(1024))))
socket.error: [Errno 10053] An established connection was aborted by the softwar
e in your host machine
 The server continues to run and receives connections just fine; only the client crashes. What's causing this? EDIT: I got the client working with the following code: import pickle
import socket
import threading

class ConnectionThread(threading.Thread):
	def run(self):
		for x in range(10):
			client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
			client.connect(('localhost', 2727))
			client.send(pickle.dumps(x))
			print('Sent:',str(x))
			print('Received:',repr(pickle.loads(client.recv(1024))))
			client.close()

for x in range(5):
	ConnectionThread().start()
 However, I still don't understand what's going on. Isn't this just opening and closing the socket a bunch of times? Shouldn't there be time limitations to that (you shouldn't be able to open a socket so soon after closing it)?
@CODE:import pickle
import socket
import threading

class ClientThread(threading.Thread):

@TITLE:Question about storing array in a std::vector in C++
@CONTENT:I am unclear about the following. First, this code compiles fine: #include <vector>

typedef struct{
	int x1,x2,x3,x4;
}  ints;

typedef std::vector<ints> vec;

int main(){
	vec v;
	ints a = {0,1,2,3};

 The following code is near identical: #include <vector>

typedef std::vector<int[4]> vec;

int main(){
	vec v;
	int a[4] = {0,1,2,3};
	v.push_back(a);
}
 but it throws the extremely length error output I will include at the end. Why does the compiler treat these two programs so differently? It is definitely not intuitive. Here is the compiler error that is thrown on my system that is using g++ to compile: [mattg@pigott Test]$ g++ test2.cpp -o test2

 ORIGINAL QUESTION: I'm taking on the simple task of converting an alphanumeric phone number to a string of digits. For example, 1-800-HI-HAXOR would become 1-800-44-42967. My initial attempt was to create a nasty switch statement, but I'd love a more elegant, and efficient solution. Here's what I've got: for(char c : inLetters.toLowerCase().toCharArray())
{
    switch(c)
    {
    case '0':                                         result+="0"; break;
    case '1':                                         result+="1"; break;
    case '2': case 'a': case 'b': case 'c':           result+="2"; break;
    case '3': case 'd': case 'e': case 'f':           result+="3"; break;
    case '4': case 'g': case 'h': case 'i':           result+="4"; break;
    case '5': case 'j': case 'k': case 'l':           result+="5"; break;
    case '6': case 'm': case 'n': case 'o':           result+="6"; break;

@TITLE:How to make easy_install execute custom commands in setup.py?
@CONTENT:I want my setup.py to do some custom actions besides just installing the Python package (like installing an init.d script, creating directories and files, etc.) I know I can customize the distutils/setuptools classes to do my own actions. The problem I am having is that everything works when I cd to the package directory and do "python setup.py install", but my custom classes don't seem to be executed when I do "easy_install mypackage.tar.gz". Here's my setup.py file (create an empty myfoobar.py file in the same dir to test): import setuptools
from setuptools.command import install as _install

class install(_install.install):
    def initialize_options(self):
        _install.install.initialize_options(self)

    def finalize_options(self):
        _install.install.finalize_options(self)

    def run(self):
        # Why is this never executed when tarball installed with easy_install?
        # It does work with: python setup.py install

    description = 'Test package',
    author = 'Someone',
    py_modules = ['myfoobar'],
    cmdclass = {'install': install},

 The same thing happens even if I import "setup" and "install" from distutils. Any ideas how I could make easy_install execute my custom classes? To clarify, I don't want to use anything extra, like Buildout or Paver.

@TITLE:How to find kth largest number in pairwise sums like setA + setB?
@CONTENT:Here are two integers set, say A and B and we can get another set C, in which every element is sum of element a in A and element b in B. For example, A = {1,2}, B = {3,4} and we get C = {4, 5, 6} where 4=1+3A 5=1+4=2+3, 6=2+4 Now I want to find out which number is the kth largest one in set C, for example 5 is 2nd largest one in above example. Is there a efficient solution? I know that pairwise sums sorting is an open problem and has a n^2 lower time bound. But since only kth largest number is needed, maybe we can learn from the O(n) algorithm of finding median number in an unsorted array. Thanks.

@TITLE:Access Violation Exception/Crash from C++ callback to C# function
@CONTENT:So I have a native 3rd party C++ code base I am working with (.lib and .hpp files) that I used to build a wrapper in C++/CLI for eventual use in C#. I've run into a particular problem when switching from Debug to Release mode, in that I get an Access Violation Exception when a callback's code returns. The code from the original hpp files for callback function format: typedef int (*CallbackFunction) (void *inst, const void *data);
 Code from the C++/CLI Wrapper for callback function format: (I'll explain why I declared two in a moment) public delegate int ManagedCallbackFunction (IntPtr oInst, const IntPtr oData);
public delegate int UnManagedCallbackFunction (void* inst, const void* data);
 --Quickly, the reason I declared a second "UnManagedCallbackFunction" is that I tried to create an "intermediary" callback in the wrapper, so the chain changed from Native C++ > C# to a version of Native C++ > C++/CLI Wrapper > C#...Full disclosure, the problem still lives, it's just been pushed to the C++/CLI Wrapper now on the same line (the return). And finally, the crashing code from C#: public static int hReceiveLogEvent(IntPtr pInstance, IntPtr pData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("in hReceiveLogEvent...");
        Console.WriteLine("pInstance: {0}", pInstance);
        Console.WriteLine("pData: {0}", pData);

        // provide object context for static member function
        helloworld hw = (helloworld)GCHandle.FromIntPtr(pInstance).Target;
        if (hw == null || pData == null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("hReceiveLogEvent: received null instance pointer or null data\n");
            return 0;
        }

        // typecast data to DataLogger object ptr
        IntPtr ip2 = GCHandle.ToIntPtr(GCHandle.Alloc(new DataLoggerWrap(pData)));
        DataLoggerWrap dlw = (DataLoggerWrap)GCHandle.FromIntPtr(ip2).Target;

        //Do Logging Stuff

        Console.WriteLine("exiting hReceiveLogEvent...");
        Console.WriteLine("pInstance: {0}", pInstance);
        Console.WriteLine("pData: {0}", pData);
        Console.WriteLine("Setting pData to zero...");
        pData = IntPtr.Zero;
        pInstance = IntPtr.Zero;
        Console.WriteLine("pData: {0}", pData);
        Console.WriteLine("pInstance: {0}", pInstance);

        return 1;
    }
 All writes to the console are done and then we see the dreaded crash on the return: Unhandled exception at 0x04d1004c in helloworld.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x04d1004c. If I step into the debugger from here, all I see is that the last entry on the call stack is: > "04d1004c()" which evaluates to a decimal value of: 80805964 Which is only interesting if you look at the console which shows: entering registerDataLogger

 Now, I know that between debug and release some things are quite different in the Microsoft world. I am, of course worried about byte padding and initialization of variables, so if there is something I am not providing here, just let me know and I'll add to the (already long) post. I also think the managed code may NOT be releasing all ownership and then the native C++ stuff (which I don't have the code for) may be trying to delete or kill off the pData object, thus crashing the app. More full disclosure, it all works fine (seemingly) in Debug mode! A real head scratch issue that would appreciate any help!
@CODE:typedef int (*CallbackFunction) (void *inst, const void *data); public delegate int ManagedCallbackFunction (IntPtr oInst, const IntPtr oData);

@CONTENT:I've been trying to get NSServices working for my application recently with no success. I have set it up according to the documentation but it does not appear in the services menu ( however it does appear in the keyboard shortcuts section of the System Preferences as a service menu item) Anyway I set the service in my app controller like this: [NSApp setServicesProvider:self];
 The method exposed is: - (void) addDownloadService:(NSPasteboard *)pboard

Anyone any ideas why it might not be working? Thanks Colin

For example, let's say that I have a ScriptManager on a MasterPage: If I have a Web Content Form that contains an UpdatePanel, does it need a ScriptManagerProxy? If I have a Web Content Form that contains a User Control and that User Control has an UpdatePanel in it, does the User Control need a ScriptManagerProxy? If I have a Web Content Form that contains an UpdatePanel and a UserControl that also contains an UpdatePanel, does the Web Content Form and/or the User Control require a ScriptManagerProxy? Thanks.

@TITLE:Marshalling BSTRs from C++ to C# with COM interop
@CONTENT:I have an out-of-process COM server written in C++, which is called by some C# client code. A method on one of the server's interfaces returns a large BSTR to the client, and I suspect that this is causing a memory leak. The code works, but I am looking for help with marshalling-out BSTRs. Simplifying a bit, the IDL for the server method is HRESULT ProcessRequest([in] BSTR request, [out] BSTR* pResponse);
 and the implementation looks like: HRESULT MyClass::ProcessRequest(BSTR request, BSTR* pResponse)
{
    USES_CONVERSION;
    char* pszRequest = OLE2A(request);
    char* pszResponse = BuildResponse(pszRequest);
    delete pszRequest;
    *pResponse = A2BSTR(pszResponse);
    delete pszResponse;
    return S_OK;
}
 A2BSTR internally allocates the BSTR using SysAllocStringLen(). In the C# client I simply do the following: string request = "something";
string response = "";
myserver.ProcessRequest(request, out response);
DoSomething(response);
 This works, in that request strings get sent to the COM server and correct response strings are returned to the C# client. But every round trip to the server leaks memory in the server process. The crt leak detection support is showing no significant leaks on the crt heap, so I'm suspecting the leak was allocated with IMalloc. Am I doing anything wrong here? I have found vague comments that 'all out parameters must be allocated with CoTaskMemAlloc, otherwise the interop marshaller won't free them' but no details. Andy

@TITLE:How to wait for a Java applet to finish loading on Safari?
@CONTENT:This doesn't work in Safari: <html>

<applet id="MyApplet" code="MyAppletClass" archive="MyApplet.jar">
<script type="text/javascript">
   alert(document.getElementById('MyApplet').myMethod);

 myMethod is a public method declared in MyAppletClass. When I first load the page in Safari, it shows the alert before the applet has finished loading (so the message box displays undefined) . If I refresh the page, the applet has already been loaded and the alert displays function myMethod() { [native code] }, as you'd expect. Of course, this means that the applet methods are not available until it has loaded, but Safari isn't blocking the JavaScript from running. The same problem happens with <body onLoad>. What I need is something like <body onAppletLoad="doSomething()">. How do I work around this issue? Thanks PS: I'm not sure if it's relevant, but the JAR is signed.

Since Firefox 3.x, we run into the following error when clicking a nav button that would generate a new frame for the TOC: Error: Permission denied for <file://> to get property Location.href from <file://>.
 I understand that this is due to security measures within FF 3.x that were not in 2.x, in that the document.domain does not match, so it's assuming this is cross-site scripting and is denying access. Is there a way to get around this issue? Perhaps just a switch to turn off/on within Firefox? A bit of JavaScript code to get around it?

@LINK:/questions/1265792/visual-studio-2005-security-updates-and-crt-dll-versions-in-manifest
@TITLE:Visual Studio 2005 security updates and CRT DLL versions in manifest
@CONTENT:Recent Visual Studio 2005 security updates may be causing problems for us. We build and internally distribute SDKs written in C++. These SDKs are a collection of header files and static libraries only. After installing the security updates our SDKs now depend on the newer versions of the MSVC CRT DLLs. These SDKs are used downstream in projects which produce EXE files. If one of these EXE files is built with a mix of SDKs (some from before the security updates, some from after), then the EXE file produced makes reference to two sets of MSVC runtime DLLs. E.g: <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
    <dependency>
        <dependentAssembly>
            <assemblyIdentity type="win32" name="Microsoft.VC80.CRT" version="8.0.50727.4053" processorArchitecture="amd64" publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b">
            </assemblyIdentity>
        </dependentAssembly>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <dependentAssembly>
            <assemblyIdentity type="win32" name="Microsoft.VC80.CRT" version="8.0.50727.762" processorArchitecture="amd64" publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b">
            </assemblyIdentity>
        </dependentAssembly>
    </dependency>
</assembly>
 Does this mean that at runtime this EXE will be using both versions of the DLL? Does this mean we must distribute both versions of the MSVC Runtime DLLs with this EXE? Is there a simple way to avoid this problem without forcing all SDKs to be built with the Visual Studio 2005 security patches in place? (This would be undesirable for some of the older and quite stable SDKs that we don't want to rebuild unnecessarily) Is is possible to simply rewrite the manifest file on either the SDKs or the final EXE file so that only one version of the MSVC CRT DLLs are mentioned? My understanding is that the relevant updates are as follows: Security update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1: KB971090 http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155934 Security update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1: KB971092 http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=155933 I have discovered two other questions which are similar: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1238376/vc-kb971090-and-selecting-visual-c-runtime-dll-dependencies http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1238741/does-the-latest-visual-studio-2005-security-update-cause-c-runtime-library-issues

@TITLE:Reading audio buffer data with AudioQueue
@CONTENT:I am attempting to read audio data via AudioQueue. When I do so, I can verify that the bit depth of the file is 16-bit. But when I get the actual sample data, I'm only seeing values from -128 to 128. But I'm also seeing suspicious looking interleaved data, which makes me pretty sure that I'm just not reading the data correctly. So to begin with, I can verify that the source file is 44100, 16-bit, mono wav file. My buffer is allocated thusly: 
char *buffer= NULL;
buffer = malloc(BUFFER_SIZE);
assert(buffer);
 All the relevant values are set and used in: 
AudioFileReadPackets(inAudioFile,false,&bytesRead,NULL,packetNum,&numPackets,buffer);   	
 As a test, just so that I can see the data retrieved, I run: 
for(int i=0;i<BUFFER_SIZE;i++){
  NSLog(@"%i", buffer[i]);
}
 Now, I know my source file peaks all over the place, but the values I see only max at -128 and 128. Being as this is a 16-bit file, I would expect that the values would instead be -32768 to 32768. In addition, there seems to be two patterns in the data. Here's an example of the data returned: 
70
-13
31
-11
-118
-9
-15
-7
116
-4
31
-1
28
1
84
2
-123
3
-97
4
110
5
54
6
126
 Now take a look at every other row starting with the second row: -13. See how it increases, not evenly, but at least smoothly? The odd-numbered rows aren't anywhere near that smooth. My first thought would be that this is interleaved stereo data, but no, it's only one channel, so there shouldn't be any interleaving, right? My best guess is that I'm just reading the data incorrectly, so the sample data is being spanned across two returns. Any idea how to read it correctly? Thanks for reading through the whole question, and for any insight you can offer.

@TITLE:How to remove gray background on MDI parent form?
@CONTENT:What I'm trying to do is draw some glass on a form marked as an mdi container. However as soon as the IsMdiContainer is set, the form adds an MdiClient to it's list of Controls. At this point something happens to the parent form - almost like a dark gray panel is being docked to the entire form onto which the MdiClient is being placed on. I then do is the following to move the MdiClient control out of the way a bit:     foreach(var c in Controls)
    {
        if(c is MdiClient)
        {
            var client = (MdiClient)c;
            client.BackColor = Color.Red;
            client.Dock = DockStyle.None;
            client.Size = new Size(this.Width-100, this.Height);
            break;
        }
    }
 This then makes the actual MdiClient area smaller so we can see what is behind it (the bit which hosts the children forms) and it is blatantly obvious that the parent form is not painting or something. As can be seen here: http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/8605/mdiglassproblem.png I now need to somehow get the area behind the MdiClient (dark gray part which is rendered white on the glass section) to go away. Any ideas? PS - Glass is being rendered using DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea method in Vista.

@TITLE:JavaScript scrollTo method does nothing?
@CONTENT:So I am desperatley trying to get some scrolling functionality to work on a page. After not having a luck I decide to just stick window.scrollTo(0, 800); on my page to see if I could get any scrolling to happen. Nothing does happen. I have an accordion that expands and then I want to scroll to a specific element with in it. But for now I would be happy to just see the thing scroll at all. Anyone run into this? Thanks!

@CONTENT:Using the Android SDK, there doesn't seem to be any way to set the style on a table row. I want to do the equivalent of: <TableRow

row.setStyle(R.style.TableRow_classic);
 Does anyone know how to find this?

@CONTENT:I've found some strange code... //in file ClassA.h:

 Obviously since Consumer.cpp only included ClassA.h and not ClassA.cpp the compiler will not be able to see that the parameter has a default value. When would the declared default value of ClassA::Enable in the signature of the method implementation have any effect? Would this only happen when the method is called from within files that include the ClassA.cpp?

 I need a sql query which would calculate and show the total amount per day. So for 3rd of Feb 2009, the total would be 699.98 I need to display Total Order Amount per day in a Chart If it would be easier to do it with PHP, do mention it as well. UPDATE: I would like to clarify that I needed the Total Amount Per Day in the Present Month. I forgot to mention that in my initial question. So i udpated Peter's query to get Total No. of Orders + Total Amount per Day in this Month. Please, let me know if it needs any correction or is there a better and shorter way of doing it.

@LINK:/questions/1126388/slow-string-concatenation-over-large-input
@TITLE:Slow string concatenation over large input
@CONTENT:I've written an n-ary tree ADT which works fine. However, I need to store its serialization in a variable a calling class. eg. 	DomTree<String> a = Data.createTreeInstance("very_large_file.xml");
	String x = a.toString();
 I've written method which serves the purpose exactly how I need it, but on very large inputs it takes forever (20mins on a 100MB xml file) - I have timed the methods and building the tree from the xml file is quick, but calling toString() as shown above is very slow. @Override
public String toString(){
	return printTree(this);
}

public String printTree(AbstractTree<E> tree){
	if (tree.isLeaf()){
		return tree.getNodeName();
	}else{
		String tStr = tree.getNodeName() + "(";

		int i = 0;
		Iterator<AbstractTree<E>> child = tree.getChildren().iterator();
	    while (i < tree.getChildren().size() - 1){

	    	tStr += printTree(child.next()) + ", ";
	    	i++;
	    }
	    tStr += printTree(child.next()) + ")";

		return tStr;	
	}
}
 I'm guessing it is to do with the way the string is built up rather than how the tree is traversed? Is there a better way to do this? UPDATE: Following the example of Skaffman, the following code give outOfMemoryError for very large input. @Override
public String toString(){
    StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();
    printTree(this, buffer);
    return buffer.toString();
 } public String printTree(AbstractTree<E> tree, StringBuilder buffer){
	if (tree.isLeaf()){
		return tree.getNodeName();
	}else{
		buffer.append(tree.getNodeName());
		buffer.append("(");

		int i = 0;
		Iterator<AbstractTree<E>> child = tree.getChildren().iterator();
	    while (i < tree.getChildren().size() - 1){

	    	buffer.append(printTree(child.next(), buffer));
	    	buffer.append(", ");
	    	i++;
	    }
	    buffer.append(printTree(child.next(), buffer)); 
	    buffer.append(")");

		return buffer.toString();	
	}
}
 UPDATE: Works perfectly now, using Skaffmans example
@CODE:DomTree<String> a = Data.createTreeInstance("very_large_file.xml");
	String x = a.toString(); @Override
public String toString(){
	return printTree(this);
}

public String printTree(AbstractTree<E> tree){
	if (tree.isLeaf()){
		return tree.getNodeName();
	}else{
		String tStr = tree.getNodeName() + "(";

		int i = 0;
		Iterator<AbstractTree<E>> child = tree.getChildren().iterator();
	    while (i < tree.getChildren().size() - 1){

	    	tStr += printTree(child.next()) + ", ";
	    	i++;
	    }
	    tStr += printTree(child.next()) + ")";

		return tStr;	
	}
} @Override
public String toString(){
    StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();
    printTree(this, buffer);
    return buffer.toString(); public String printTree(AbstractTree<E> tree, StringBuilder buffer){
	if (tree.isLeaf()){
		return tree.getNodeName();
	}else{
		buffer.append(tree.getNodeName());
		buffer.append("(");

		int i = 0;
		Iterator<AbstractTree<E>> child = tree.getChildren().iterator();
	    while (i < tree.getChildren().size() - 1){

	    	buffer.append(printTree(child.next(), buffer));
	    	buffer.append(", ");
	    	i++;
	    }
	    buffer.append(printTree(child.next(), buffer)); 
	    buffer.append(")");

		return buffer.toString();

@TITLE:oo question - mixing controller logic and business logic
@CONTENT:I'm not sure if I'm using "standard" terms, but this is a basic OO question I'm trying to resolve. I'm coding a windows form. I don't want logic in the form event handler, so I just make a call to a custom object from there. At the custom object, there are two sets of logic. The "controller" logic, which decides what needs to get done and when. The actual business logic that does what needs to be done (for example a control that performs a math operation and returns results, etc.). My question is, does OO architecture allow for having both of these in a single object? Or is it recommended to split them out into a "controller" object and a "business logic" object? Is there a design pattern I should refer to for this? For the time being, I've started down the route of combining them into one object. This object has a "start" method which contains the controller logic. This method then calls other methods of the object as needed, and ultimately returns results to the caller of the object.

@LINK:/questions/897525/haskell-style-efficiency
@TITLE:Haskell style/efficiency
@CONTENT:So I was working on a way to lazily generate primes, and I came up with these three definitions, which all work in an equivalent way - just checking whether each new integer has a factor among all the preceding primes: primes1 :: [Integer]
primes1 = mkPrimes id [2..]
  where mkPrimes f (x:xs) = 
          if f (const True) x 
          then 
            let g h y = y `mod` x > 0 && h y in
            x : mkPrimes (f . g) xs
          else
            mkPrimes f xs

primes2 :: [Integer]
primes2 = mkPrimes id (const True) [2..]
  where mkPrimes f f_ (x:xs) = 
          if f_ x 
          then 
            let g h y = y `mod` x > 0 && h y in
            x : mkPrimes (f . g) ( f $ g $ const True) xs
          else
            mkPrimes f f_ xs

primes3 :: [Integer]
primes3 = mkPrimes [] [2..]
  where mkPrimes ps (x:xs) = 
          if all (\p -> x `mod` p > 0) ps
          then 
            x : mkPrimes (ps ++ [x]) xs
          else
            mkPrimes ps xs
 So it seems to me primes2 should be a little faster than primes1, since it avoids recomputing f_ = f (const True) for every integer (which I think requires work on the order of the number of primes we've found thus far), and only updates it when we encounter a new prime. Just from unscientific tests (running take 1000 in ghci) it seems like primes3 runs faster than primes2. Should I take a lesson from this, and assume that if I can represent a function as an operation on an array, that I should implement it in the latter manner for efficiency, or is there something else going on here?

@TITLE:Is there a way to define variables of two different types in a for loop initializer?
@CONTENT:You can define 2 variables of the same type in a for loop: int main() {
  for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < 10; i += 1, j = 2*i) {
    cout << j << endl;
  }
}
 But it is illegal to define variables of different types: int main() {
  for (int i = 0, float j = 0.0; i < 10; i += 1, j = 2*i) {
    cout << j << endl;
  }
}
 Is there a way to do this? (I don't need to use i inside the loop, just j.) If you have totally hacked and obscure solution, It's OK for me. In this contrived example I know you could just use double for both variables. I'm looking for a general answer. Please do not suggest to move any of the variables outside of for body, probably not usable for me as one is an iterator that has to disappear just after the loop and the for statement is to be enclosed in my foreach macro: #define foreach(var, iter, instr) {                  \
    typeof(iter) var##IT = iter;                     \
    typeof(iter)::Element var = *var##IT;            \
    for (; var##_iterIT.is_still_ok(); ++var##IT, var = *var#IT) {  \
      instr;                                         \
    }                                                \
  }
 It can be used thus: foreach(ii, collection, {
  cout << ii;
}). 
 But I need something that will be used like that: foreach(ii, collection)
  cout << ii;
 Please do not introduce any runtime overhead (but it might be slow to compile).

@TITLE:Are there any alternatives to implementing Clone in Java?
@CONTENT:In my Java project, I have a vector of various types of Traders. These different types of traders are subclasses of the Trader class. Right now, I have a method that takes a Trader as an argument and stores it 50 or so times in the vector. I am having problems because storing the same object 50 times is just storing 50 references of the same object. I need to store 50 copies of the object. I've researched about implementing Clone, but I don't want the programmers defining a type of Trader to have to worry about making their class cloneable. Also, as pointed out by this page, implementing clone creates all sorts of problems. I don't think a copy constructor would work either because if I defined one in the Trader class, it would not know the type of Trader it was copying and just make a generic Trader. What can I do? Edit: I am not really wanting to make exact copies of a certain object. What I am really trying to do is to add a certain number of Traders to the vector. The problem is that the user needs to specify in an argument which type of Trader he wants to add. Here is an example of what I am trying to do: (although my syntax is completely imaginary) public void addTraders(*traderType*)
{
    tradervect.add(new *traderType*())

@CONTENT:Further to this question: Algorithm for determining a file・s identity Recap: I'm looking for a cheap algorithm for determining a files identity which works the vast majority of the time. I went ahead and implemented an algorithm that gives me a "pretty unique" hash per file. The way my algorithm works is: For files smaller than a certain threshold I use the full files content for the identity hash. For files larger than the threshold I take random N samples of X size. I include the filesize in the hashed data. (meaning all files with different sizes result in a different hash) Questions: What values should I choose for N and X (how many random samples should I take of which size?) I went with 4 samples of 8K each and am not able to stump the algorithm. I found that increasing the amount of samples quickly decreases the speed of the algorithm (cause seeks are pretty expensive) The maths one: how non-different do my files need to be for this algorithm to blow up. (2 different files with same length end up having the same hash) The optimization one: Are there any ways I can optimize my concrete implementation to improve throughput (I seem to be able to do about 100 files a second on my system). Does this implementation look sane? Can you think of any real world examples where this will fail. (My focus is on media files) Relevant information: The algorithm I implemented Thanks for your help!

But if it's a NullReferenceException, if I try to use a member of e inside TakeRandom(), NullReferenceException will be thrown anyway.

@TITLE:Are Delphi strings immutable?
@CONTENT:As far as I know, strings are immutable in Delphi. I kind of understand that means if you do: string1 := 'Hello';
string1 := string1 + " World";
 first string is destroyed and you get a reference to a new string "Hello World". But what happens if you have the same string in different places around your code? I have a string hash assigned for identifying several variables, so for example a "change" is identified by a hash value of the properties of that change. That way it's easy for me to check to "changes" for equality. Now, each hash is computed separately (not all the properties are taken into account so that to separate instances can be equal even if they differ on some values). The question is, how does Delphi handles those strings? If I compute to separate hashes to the same 10 byte length string, what do I get? Two memory blocks of 10 bytes or two references to the same memory block? Clarification: A change is composed by some properties read from the database and is generated by an individual thread. The TChange class has a GetHash method that computes a hash based on some of the values (but not all) resulting on a string. Now, other threads receive the Change and have to compare it to previously processed changes so that they don't process the same (logical) change. Hence the hash and, as they have separate instances, two different strings are computed. I'm trying to determine if it'd be a real improvement to change from string to something like a 128 bit hash or it'll be just wasting my time. Edit: Version of Delphi is Delphi 7.0

 And this is an instance class which gets incremented (each time a customer - an instance object - makes a purchase), is this variable thread safe?

What I'm lacking in the thinking dept is that this variable will be working with different customer objects (e.g. John, Paul, etc) so is thread safe but this is flawed thinking and a bit of inexperience in concurrent programming. This sounds very naive, but then I don't have a lot of experience in concurrent coding like I do in general, synchronous coding. EDIT: Also, the function call getFromDb() isn't part of the question and I don't expect anyone to guess on its thread safety as it's just a call to indicate the value is assigned from a function which gets data from the db. :) EDIT 2: Also, getFromDb's thread safety is guaranteed as it only performs read operations.

@TITLE:ServiceProcessInstaller fails with ：No mapping between account names and security IDs was done；
@CONTENT:I have an installer class using ServiceProcessInstaller. In the installer class in the constructor I add it to installers: serviceProcessInstaller = new ServiceProcessInstaller();
serviceInstaller = new ServiceInstaller();

// Add Both Installers to Project Installers Collection to be Run
Installers.AddRange(new Installer[]
                                {

                                });
 and in Install method I set the username and password: public override void Install(IDictionary stateSaver)
{
    .... open the form, bla bla bla
    serviceProcessInstaller.Password = accountForm.txtPassword.Text;
    serviceProcessInstaller.Username = accountForm.txtServiceAccount.Text;
    serviceProcessInstaller.Account = ServiceAccount.User;
}
 when I try to run it however, I get the very descriptive error message: "No mapping between account names and security IDs was done". What am I doing wrong? EDIT: I tested that this error happens only when I install this component using msi package. It works just fine when I run InstallUtil against it.

@TITLE:C# convert string into its byte[] equivalent
@CONTENT:At this point most people will be thinking "Ah ill post this..:" byte[] dataB= System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data);
 However.. the problem I have is i need the exact value of the bytes with no encoding just the pure value for each byte. For example if the value of the string is (0xFF32) i want it to convert it too {255,50}. he reason for this is I have a file format I am attempting to read which stores int's as bytes saves them and then reads them when the program opens. This is what I have so far: ...
dialog.InitialDirectory =
    Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop) +
    "/Test";

dialog.Title="Open File";

if (dialog.ShowDialog(this) == DialogResult.OK)

    reader.Close();
    byte[] fileC = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data);
    File_Read(dialog.FileName,fileC);
}
...
 So when I try and read the file it converts the file convents of say 0xFF into 0x3F because 0xFF is greater then 127 and 0x3F is a ?. Sorry if i seem a bit confusing :) Thanks, Michael

@TITLE:Byte order with a large array of characters in C
@CONTENT:Hey guys, question from a C/Networking newbie... I'm doing some socket programming in C and trying to wrestle with byte order problems. My request (send) is fine but when I receive data my bytes are all out of order. I start with something like this... char * aResponse= (char *)malloc(512);
int total = recv(sock, aResponse, 511, 0);
 When dealing with this response, each 16bit word seems to have it's bytes reversed (I'm using UDP). I tried to fix that by doing something like this...     unsigned short * _netOrder= (unsigned short *)aResponse;
    unsigned short * newhostOrder= (unsigned short *)malloc(total);
    for (i = 0; i < total; ++i)
    {
	     newhostOrder[i] = ntohs(_netOrder[i]);
    }
 This works ok when I'm treating the data as a short, however if I cast the pointer to a char again the bytes are reversed. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!
@CODE:char * aResponse= (char *)malloc(512);
int total = recv(sock, aResponse, 511, 0); unsigned short * _netOrder= (unsigned short *)aResponse;

@CONTENT:I have an application that reads lines from a file and runs its magic on each line as it is read. Once the line is read and properly processed, I would like to delete the line from the file. A backup of the removed line is already being kept. I would like to do something like file = open('myfile.txt', 'rw+')
for line in file:

   file.truncate(line)
 This seems like a simple problem, but I would like to do it right rather than a whole lot of complicated seek() and tell() calls. Maybe all I really want to do is remove a particular line from a file. After spending far to long on this problem I decided that everyone was probably right and this it just not a good way to do things. It just seemed so elegant solution. What I was looking for was something akin to a FIFO that would just let me pop lines out of a file.

@TITLE:Good zlib implementation in .NET?
@CONTENT:I'm building an network application that needs to be able to switch from normal network traffic to a zlib compressed stream, mid stream. My thoughts on the matter involve boolean switch that when on will cause the network code to pass all the data through a class that I can feed IEnumerable<byte> into, and then pull out the decompressed stream, passing that on to the already existing protocol parsing code. Things I've looked at: ZLib.NET - It seems a little... Ecclectic, and not quite what I want. Would still make a decent start to build off though. (Jon Skeet's comments here hardly inspire me either.) SharpZipLib - This doesn't seem to support zlib at all? Can anyone confirm or deny this? I would very much prefer and all managed solution, but let's have at it... are there any other implementations of this library out there in .NET, that might be better suited to what I want to do, or should I take ZLib.NET and build off that as a start? PS: Jon's asked for more detail, so here it is. I'm trying to implement MCCP 2. This involves a signal being sent in the network stream, and everything after this signal is a zlib compressed data stream. There's links to exactly what they mean by that in the above link. Anyway, to be clear, I'm on the recieving end of this (client, not server), and I have a bunch of data read out of the network stream already, and the toggle will be in the middle of this (in all likelyhood atleast), so any solution needs to be able to have some extra data fed into it, before it takes over the NetworkStream (or I manually feed in the rest of the data).

@CONTENT:I ran into a situation today where Java was not invoking the method I expected -- Here is the minimal test case: (I'm sorry this seems contrived -- the 'real world' scenario is substantially more complex, and makes much more sense from a "why the hell would you do that?" standpoint.) I'm specifically interested in why this happens, I don't care about redesign suggestions. I have a feeling this is in Java Puzzlers, but I don't have my copy handy. See the specific question in commends within Test<T>.getValue() below: public class Ol2 {  

    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Test<Integer> t = new Test<Integer>() {  
            protected Integer value() { return 5; }  
        };  

        System.out.println(t.getValue());  
    }  
}  


abstract class Test<T> {  
    protected abstract T value();  

    public String getValue() {  
        // Why does this always invoke makeString(Object)?  
        // The type of value() is available at compile-time.
        return Util.makeString(value());  
    }  
}  

class Util {  
    public static String makeString(Integer i){  
        return "int: "+i;  
    }  
    public static String makeString(Object o){  
        return "obj: "+o;  
    }  
}
 The output from this code is: obj: 5
@CODE:public class Ol2 {  

    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Test<Integer> t = new Test<Integer>() {

@CONTENT:I am binding an Image.Source property to the result of the property shown below. public BitmapSource MyImageSource

 For some reason this is failing during the rendering of the image (Deep in the PresentationCore assembly). I am certain the image is not corrupt as I can successfully show the same image w/o the binding <Image Name="FooImage" Source="/logo.png" />
 I have to bind the image source in code because I will eventually be creating the image stream from a base64 string. Anyone know if this is a bug w/ WPF? or am I doing something incorrectly?

@LINK:/questions/396168/circular-dependencies-in-ruby
@TITLE:Circular Dependencies in Ruby
@CONTENT:Let's say we have two classes, Foo and Foo Sub, each in a different file, foo.rb and foo_sub.rb respectively. foo.rb: require "foo_sub"
class Foo
    def foo
        FooSub.SOME_CONSTANT
    end
end
 foo_sub.rb: require "foo"
class FooSub < Foo
    SOME_CONSTANT = 1
end
 This isn't going to work due to the circular dependency - we can't define either class without the other. There are various solutions that I've seen. Two of them I want to avoid - namely, putting them in the same file and removing the circular dependency. So, the only other solution I've found is a forward declaration: foo.rb: class Foo
end
require "foo_sub"
class Foo
    def foo
        FooSub.SOME_CONSTANT
    end
end
 foo_sub.rb require "foo"
class FooSub < Foo
    SOME_CONSTANT = 1
end
 Unfortunately, I can't get the same thing to work if I have three files: foo.rb: class Foo
end
require "foo_sub_sub"
class Foo
    def foo
        FooSubSub.SOME_CONSTANT
    end
end
 foo_sub.rb: require "foo"
class FooSub < Foo
end
 foo_sub_sub.rb: require "foo_sub"
class FooSubSub < FooSub
    SOME_CONSTANT = 1
end
 If I require foo_sub.rb, then FooSub is an uninitialized constant in foo_sub_sub.rb. Any ideas how to get around this without putting them in the same file nor removing the circular dependency?
@CODE:require "foo_sub"
class Foo
    def foo
        FooSub.SOME_CONSTANT
    end
end require "foo"
class FooSub < Foo
    SOME_CONSTANT = 1
end class Foo
end
require "foo_sub"
class Foo
    def foo
        FooSub.SOME_CONSTANT
    end
end require "foo"
class FooSub < Foo
    SOME_CONSTANT = 1
end class Foo
end
require "foo_sub_sub"
class Foo

@TITLE:Big integer field in django models
@CONTENT:In short: How do you specify a BIGINT in Django models? In a current project I am doing using Django (0.97-svn release), I've all the integer fields in all the models defined as IntegerField. It was working immaculately during the development cycle where I was using SQLite for the DB backend. However, as soon as I rolled off to MySQL, I noticed that for one of the IntegerFields, MySQL was truncating data---apparently, for reasons still unknown to me, SQLite didn't complain. I looked at the schema and found out that an IntegerField in Django is represented as an INT(11) field in MySQL. Naturally, the reason MySQL was truncating data was because the data was more than 11-digit in length. To workaround, I had to manually update the column to, in this case, be a BIGINT(20). Django and MySQL coexist peacefully with that. But whenever I reset the application in which rests the model containing that BIGINT, Django again creates it as an INT(11). I've looked at Django docs, and not found anything. Have I overlooked something? Thanks.

So is there a way to set a variable to be the current date when it is compiled? I could have a batch file that would compile it and deploy the new exe to the distribution server. Thanks

@CONTENT:I am trying to understand the process of declaration and assignment of a primitive type at the back stage. int i; i = 3; For 1), on the memory stack, it assigns a space for storing an int type value named i For 2), it assigns the value 3 to the space preserved above Is there a memory address there? From my impression, memory address is always associated with the objects on the heap? Update: Regarding the replies: So, for every variable on the stack, they are all assigned a memory address as well just like the objects on the heap. Am I correct? But for Java, this is not the case?

@TITLE:Big integer field in django models
@CONTENT:In short: How do you specify a BIGINT in Django models? In a current project I am doing using Django (0.97-svn release), I've all the integer fields in all the models defined as IntegerField. It was working immaculately during the development cycle where I was using SQLite for the DB backend. However, as soon as I rolled off to MySQL, I noticed that for one of the IntegerFields, MySQL was truncating data---apparently, for reasons still unknown to me, SQLite didn't complain. I looked at the schema and found out that an IntegerField in Django is represented as an INT(11) field in MySQL. Naturally, the reason MySQL was truncating data was because the data was more than 11-digit in length. To workaround, I had to manually update the column to, in this case, be a BIGINT(20). Django and MySQL coexist peacefully with that. But whenever I reset the application in which rests the model containing that BIGINT, Django again creates it as an INT(11). I've looked at Django docs, and not found anything. Have I overlooked something? Thanks.

@CONTENT:I'm writing a C# app using the WebBrowser control, and I want all content I display to come from embedded resources - not static local files, and not remote files. Setting the initial text of the control to an embedded HTML file works great with this code inspired by this post: browser.DocumentText=loadResourceText("myapp.index.html");

I found similar questions here and here, but neither is asking exactly what I mean, namely referring to embedded resources in the exe, not files.

@LINK:/questions/271218/rename-nodes-with-xslt
@TITLE:Rename nodes with XSLT
@CONTENT:I am trying something very simple, but for some reason it does not work. Basically, I need to rename some nodes in an XML document. Thus, I created an XSLT file to do the transformation. Here is an example of the XML: EDIT: Addresses and Address elements occur at many levels. This is what caused me to have to try and apply an XSLT. The Visual Studio typed dataset feature, which creates typed datasets from XSD files does not permit you to have nested references to the same table. Thus, having Businesses/Business/Addresses and Businesses/Business/Contact/Addresses causes the Load() to fail. This is a known issue, and all they tell you is something like "Don't have nested table references...edit your XSD to stop having that." Unfortunately, this means that we have to apply XSLT to make the XML conform to the "hacked" XSD, since the files are coming from a third party vendor. So, we are very close with the help rendered here. The last couple of things are these: 1.) How can I use the namespace reference in the match attribute of the xsl:template in order to specify that I want to rename Businesses/Business/Addresses to BusinessAddresses, but rename Businesses/Business/Contacts/Contact/Addresses to ContactAddresses? 2.) How can I stop the XSLT from cluttering every new element with explicit namespace references? It is causing extreme bloat in the output. I created a namespace called "steel", and was having good success with: <xsl:template match="steel:Addresses>
  <xsl:element name="BusinessAddresses>
</xsl:template>
 The obvious problem here is that it renames ALL of the Addresses elements to BusinessAddresses, even though I want some of them named ContactAddresses, and so on. The needless addition of explicit namespace references to all of the renamed nodes is also troublesome. I tried this sort of thing, but as soon as I add slashes to the match attribute, it is a a syntax error in the XSLT, like so: <xsl:template match="steel:/Businesses/Business/Addresses">
 I feel very close, but need some guidance on how to mix both the namespace usage and a way to use the slashes to select ANY nodes under specific paths. <?xml version="1.0"?>
<Businesses>
  <Business>
    <BusinessName>Steel Stretching</BusinessName>
    <Addresses>
      <Address>
        <City>Pittsburgh</City>

      <Address>
        <City>Lancaster</City>
      </Address>
    </Addresses>
  </Business>
</Businesses>
 I need to rename Addresses to BusinessAddresses, and I need to rename Address to BusinessAddress, for every instance of Addresses and Address directly under a Business node. I also need to rename Addresses to ContactAddresses, and I need to rename Address to ContactAddress, for every instance of Addresses and Address directly under a Contact Node. I have tried several solutions, but none seem to work. They all end up producing the same XML as the original file. Here is an example of what I have tried:   <xsl:template match="/">
    <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()" />
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="@*|*">
    <xsl:copy>
      <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()" />
    </xsl:copy>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="Addresses">
    <BusinessAddresses>
      <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()" />
    </BusinessAddresses>
  </xsl:template>
 This has been tried in at least 6 different flavors, complete with stepping through the XSLT debugger in VB.Net. It never executes the template match for Addresses. Why?
@CODE:<xsl:template match="steel:Addresses>
  <xsl:element name="BusinessAddresses>
</xsl:template> <xsl:template match="steel:/Businesses/Business/Addresses"> <?xml version="1.0"?>

@CONTENT:I need to add a tooltip/alt to a "td" element inside of my tables with jquery. Can someone help me out? I tried:         var tTip ="Hello world";
    $(this).attr("onmouseover", tip(tTip));
 where I have verified that I am using the "td" as "this". Edit:I am able to capture the "td" element through using the "alert" command and it worked. So for some reason the "tip" function doesn't work. Anyone know why this would be?

@TITLE:Apache/Rails/Passenger Displaying Site Index?
@CONTENT:I have a Rails app that I have successfully tested with Mongrel and Webkit. Now I want to test deployment. I set up a VMWare Image using Ubuntu 8.04. I have installed Rails following this method https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RubyOnRails with the exception of using Gems 1.3 instead of 1.2. I have configured and installed Passenger. However, when I visit my sites index (http://some.ip.that.i'm.testing/) I simply get the directory index of my rails site. I should note that since I'm testing I just dumped my app in /var/www. My Apache2 error.log file shows this and this only: [Tue Sep 30 15:10:41 2008] [notice] Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) Phusion_Passenger/2.0.3 configured -- resuming normal operations Any idea what could be causing this problem? It seems Passenger is configured properly, but I'm not sure why my rails app is not displaying and why the site's directory listing is. Thanks.

@TITLE:When is modal UI acceptable?
@CONTENT:By and large, modal interfaces suck big rocks. On the other hand, I can't think of a better way to handle File Open..., or Print... and this, I think, is because they are occasional actions, infrequent and momentous, and they are atomic in nature; you either finish specifying all your print options and go through with it, or you cancel the whole show. Let's put together a little style-guide. Suggest any use-cases in which a dialog is the preferred presentation and why it is preferred. Can the dialog be non-modal? If it is, how do you mark transactional boundaries, since Cancel ceases to have a clear meaning. Do you use an Apply button, for example?

@CONTENT:We have a few operations where we are doing a large number of large string concatenations, and have recently encountered an out of memory exception. Unfortunately, debugging the code is not an option, as this is occurring at a customer site. So, before looking into a overhaul of our code, I would like to ask: what is the RAM consumption characteristics of StringBuilder for large strings?

@CONTENT:One thing I am concerned with is that I discovered two ways of registering delegates to events. OnStuff += this.Handle; OnStuff += new StuffEventHandler(this.Handle); The first one is clean, and it makes sense doing "OnStuff -= this.Handle;" to unregister from the event... But with the latter case, should I do "OnStuff -= new StuffEventHandler(this.Handle);"? It feels like I am not removing anything at all, since I'm throwing in another StuffEventHandler reference. Does the event compare the delegate by reference? I am concerned I could start a nasty memory pool here. Get me? I don't have the reference to the "new StuffEventHandler" I previously registered.

@CONTENT:When creating a setup/MSI with Visual Studio is it possible to make a setup for a simple application that doesn't require administrator permissions to install? If its not possible under Windows XP is it possible under Vista? For example a simple image manipulation application that allows you to paste photos on top of backgrounds. I believe installing to the Program Files folder requires administrator permissions? Can we install in the \AppData folder instead? The objective is to create an application which will install for users who are not members of the administrators group on the local machine and will not show the UAC prompt on Vista. I believe a limitation this method would be that if it installs under the app data folder for the current user other users couldn't run it. Update: Can you package a click once install in a normal setup.exe type installer? You may ask why we want this - the reason is we have an installer that does a prereq check and installs anything required (such as .NET) and we then downloads and executes the MSI. We would like to display a normal installer start screen too even if that's the only thing displayed. We don't mind if the app can only be seen by one user (the user it's installed for).

  val oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(s"/some/path/$name"))
  oos.writeObject(model)
  oos.close
}

schools.zip(bySchoolArrayModels).foreach{
  case (name, model) => saveModel(name, Model)
}
 I have tried using "s3://some/path/$name" and "/user/hadoop/some/path/$name". I would like the models to be saved on amazon s3 eventually but they both fails with messages indicating the path cannot be found. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!
@CODE:import java.io._

def saveModel(name: String, model: PipelineModel) = {
  val oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(s"/some/path/$name"))
  oos.writeObject(model)
  oos.close
}

@TITLE:Picking elements of a list until condition is met with Java 8 Lambdas
@CONTENT:I am trying to switch my mind to think the functional way and recently faced a situation in which I needed to pick up elements from a list until a condition is met and I could not find an easy natural way of achieving this. Obviously I am still learning. Say I have this list: List<String> tokens = Arrays.asList("pick me", "Pick me", "pick Me",
    "PICK ME", "pick me and STOP", "pick me", "pick me and Stop", "pick me");

// In a non lambdas was you would do it like below
List<String> myTokens = new ArrayList<>();
for (String token : tokens) {
    myTokens.add(token);
    if (token.toUpperCase().endsWith("STOP")) {
        break;
    }
}
 Thank you in advance for your inputs NOTE: Before publishing this I read Limit a stream by a predicate but I could not see how I can adapt that answer to my problem. Any help would be appreciated thanks.

@TITLE:`-costToNode:` Not Sent to GKGraphNode2D Subclass in GameplayKit
@CONTENT:I have what is perhaps a stupid question about Apple's new GameplayKit. I am creating a 2D grid-based node layout for my game. I mostly love the functionality of the GKGraphNode2D, but would like to tweak it in one way. I'd like to conditionally add a penalty when traversing a certain kind of node pair. In other words, I want some nodes connected in a straight-forward way, and some nodes connected such that their traversal distance is modified by my app. I thought subclassing GKGraphNode2D and overriding -costToNode: and -estimatedCostToNode: would work perfectly! I'd return the value supplied by super sometimes, and tweak it for my game at other times. These two methods are methods on GKGraphNode, the superclass of GKGraphdNode2D. Unfortunately, when I try to do this, it appears that -costToNode: and -estimatedCostToNode: are never called on my GKGraphNode2D subclass. I would expect these methods to be invoked when I call -findPathFromNode:toNode: on my GKGraph object that contains a bunch of my GKGraphNode2D subclass objects. What am I doing wrong? Edit: The following is my code. Create two classes, CheapNode and ExpensiveNode, that are subclasses of GKGraphNode2D, as follows: @import UIKit;
@import GameplayKit;

@interface CheapNode : GKGraphNode2D
@end

@implementation CheapNode

- (float)estimatedCostToNode:(GKGraphNode *)node {
    return 1;
}

- (float)costToNode:(GKGraphNode *)node {
    return 1;
}

@end
 and @import UIKit;
@import GameplayKit;

@interface ExpensiveNode : GKGraphNode2D
@end

@implementation ExpensiveNode

- (float)estimatedCostToNode:(GKGraphNode *)node {
    return 100;
}

- (float)costToNode:(GKGraphNode *)node {
    return 100;
}

@end
 Then in a test, I've created some nodes, connected them, added them to a graph, and sent the findPathFromNode:toNode: message to the graph. Then, I check the path that the graph finds, and I don't find what I expect. - (void)testNodeCostsUsed {
    /*
     This is the graph we are creating:

     A---B---C
     |       |
     F---E---D

     where all of the nodes are `CheapNode` objects, except 'B', which is an
     `ExpensiveNode` object.

     This test finds a path from node A to node C.

     If the cost methods in the `CheapNode` and `ExpensiveNode` subclasses
     are used, the route going from A to C around B (down, then right, then up)
     should be used, since the cost of going from B to C is 100, and the cost of
     going from any other node to any other node is 1 
     (see implementation of these classes).

     Instead, we see `GKGraph` choosing the "shortest" route in terms of number
     of nodes, from the top left immediately to the right to the top right.
     */

    CheapNode     *nodeA = [[CheapNode alloc]     initWithPoint:(vector_float2){0, 0}];
    ExpensiveNode *nodeB = [[ExpensiveNode alloc] initWithPoint:(vector_float2){1, 0}];
    CheapNode     *nodeC = [[CheapNode alloc]     initWithPoint:(vector_float2){2, 0}];
    CheapNode     *nodeD = [[CheapNode alloc]     initWithPoint:(vector_float2){2, 1}];
    CheapNode     *nodeE = [[CheapNode alloc]     initWithPoint:(vector_float2){1, 1}];
    CheapNode     *nodeF = [[CheapNode alloc]     initWithPoint:(vector_float2){0, 1}];

    [nodeA addConnectionsToNodes:@[ nodeB, nodeF ] bidirectional:YES];
    [nodeC addConnectionsToNodes:@[ nodeB, nodeD ] bidirectional:YES];
    [nodeE addConnectionsToNodes:@[ nodeF, nodeD ] bidirectional:YES];

    NSArray *allNodes = @[ nodeA, nodeB, nodeC, nodeD, nodeE, nodeF ];

    GKGraph *graph = [GKGraph graphWithNodes:allNodes];
    NSArray *nodes = [graph findPathFromNode:nodeA toNode:nodeC];

    NSArray *expectedPath   = @[ nodeA, nodeF, nodeE, nodeD, nodeC ];
    NSArray *prohibitedPath = @[ nodeA, nodeB, nodeC ];

    XCTAssert([nodes isEqualToArray:expectedPath], @"");
    XCTAssertFalse([nodes isEqualToArray:prohibitedPath], @"");
}
 This test case fails. I also notice that estimatedCostToNode: and costToNode: are never sent to my GKGraphNode2D subclasses (as verified by log statements and breakpoints). Here is a sample project demonstrating this issue. It should build and run on the latest developer beta of Xcode (as of 08/31/2015, Xcode beta 6). Edit 2: I have submitted the sample code and the description in this StackOverflow question as a bug (http://www.openradar.me/22524760) if anyone is interested in duping. If the bug persists after iOS 9 is released, I will use a developer support ticket to try to resolve this issue. Edit 3: Apple got back to me on my Developer Support Ticket. They admitted this is a bug, and it (as far as I can tell) seems to be fixed in iOS 9.2 beta 2 (7C46t). ?

@TITLE:advantage WebSockets over TCP/IP
@CONTENT:We have an application that connects to a server and sends it position every 15 seconds. Now our client has asked to "upgrade" our current TCP/IP connection into WebSocket. The reason for this is he heard it used less bandwidth and he wants to diminish the 15 seconds to 1 second. (not a public application so battery drain is not really a problem) I have already done some research and many WebSockets vs HTTP comparisons but only 2 or 3 comparisons of WebSocket vs TCP/IP. I've already found out that : WebSockets are basically the same as TCP/IP but TCP/IP works on a lower layer than WebSockets. WebSockets might use less bandwidth because its protocol might be more efficient than our current protocol. WebSockets use more resources on the server side. My question is: is it worth it to change our existing code and make use of WebSockets instead of the good ol' TCP/IP sockets?

 The code works but I'm having trouble to understand it. I understand the purpose of if (hi <= lo) {
    return;
}
 but I do not know what happens when return is executed. I do not understand why the last else in the merge function exists. If the algorithm is splitting up until aux is [3,5] and I want to sort ascending, the else if will compare 5 < 3 which will jump to the else and it should exchange the 2 values. Edit: I played a bit with the debugger and for this example (3 33 1 55 66 34 67 45 23) it reaches the merge function with the first 2 values . The last else if compares 33 < 3 and enters the last else .If these values are in the correct order what is the point of this line of code? After array[k] = aux[i++]; is executed the value of array[0] is the same which is odd because aux[i++] is array[1]
@CODE:private void merge(int[] array, int[] aux, int low, int mid, int hi) {

@CONTENT:I just posted a question recently asking how to reshape data from a long table to a wide table. Then I found spread() is a quite handy function for doing this. So now I need some further development on my previous post. Let's suppose we have a table like this: id1   |  id2 |  info  | action_time | action_comment  |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time1    |        comment1 |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time2    |        comment2 |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time3    |        comment3 |
 2    | b    |  info2 |    time4    |        comment4 |
 2    | b    |  info2 |    time5    |        comment5 |
 And I would like to change it to something like this: id1   |  id2 |  info  |action_time 1|action_comment1 |action_time 2|action_comment2 |action_time 3|action_comment3  |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time1    |      comment1  |    time2    |      comment2  |    time3    |      comment3   |
 2    | b    |  info2 |    time4    |      comment4  |    time5    |      comment5  |             |                 |
 So the difference between this question and my previous question is I added another column and I need it to be reshaped as well. I'm thinking to use library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

df %>% 
  group_by(id1) %>% 
  mutate(action_no = paste("action_time", row_number())) %>%
  spread(action_no, value = c(action_time, action_comment))
 But it gives me an error message when I put two values in value argument saying : Invalid column specification. I really like the idea of using such %>% operator to manipulate data, so I'm keen to know how to correct my code to make this happen. Much appreciate for the help
@CODE:spread() id1   |  id2 |  info  | action_time | action_comment  |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time1    |        comment1 |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time2    |        comment2 |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time3    |        comment3 |
 2    | b    |  info2 |    time4    |        comment4 |
 2    | b    |  info2 |    time5    |        comment5 | id1   |  id2 |  info  |action_time 1|action_comment1 |action_time 2|action_comment2 |action_time 3|action_comment3  |
 1    | a    |  info1 |    time1    |      comment1  |    time2    |      comment2  |    time3    |      comment3   |
 2    | b    |  info2 |    time4    |      comment4  |    time5    |      comment5  |             |                 | library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

df %>% 
  group_by(id1) %>% 
  mutate(action_no = paste("action_time", row_number())) %>%
  spread(action_no, value = c(action_time, action_comment)) value %>%

@TITLE:Disable UIPageViewController bouncing - Swift
@CONTENT:I've been making a sample app with scrolling between UIViewControllers but the point is i want to disable the bouncing effect at the end of scrolling and when going back to the first UIViewController. here is my code : class PageViewController: UIPageViewController,UIPageViewControllerDataSource, UIPageViewControllerDelegate{

    var index = 0
    var identifiers: NSArray = ["FirstNavigationController", "SecondNavigationController"]
    override func viewDidLoad() {

        self.dataSource = self
        self.delegate = self

        let startingViewController = self.viewControllerAtIndex(self.index)

        let viewControllers: NSArray = [startingViewController]
        self.setViewControllers(viewControllers as [AnyObject], direction: UIPageViewControllerNavigationDirection.Forward, animated: false, completion: nil)
    }

    func viewControllerAtIndex(index: Int) -> UINavigationController! {

        let storyBoard : UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle:nil)
        //first view controller = firstViewControllers navigation controller
        if index == 0 {

            return storyBoard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("FirstNavigationController") as! UINavigationController

        }

        //second view controller = secondViewController's navigation controller
        if index == 1 {

            return storyBoard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("SecondNavigationController") as! UINavigationController
        }

        return nil
    }
    func pageViewController(pageViewController: UIPageViewController, viewControllerAfterViewController viewController: UIViewController) -> UIViewController? {

        let identifier = viewController.restorationIdentifier
        let index = self.identifiers.indexOfObject(identifier!)

        //if the index is the end of the array, return nil since we dont want a view controller after the last one
        if index == identifiers.count - 1 {

            return nil
        }

        //increment the index to get the viewController after the current index
        self.index = self.index + 1
        return self.viewControllerAtIndex(self.index)

    }

    func pageViewController(pageViewController: UIPageViewController, viewControllerBeforeViewController viewController: UIViewController) -> UIViewController? {

        let identifier = viewController.restorationIdentifier
        let index = self.identifiers.indexOfObject(identifier!)

        let viewControllers: NSArray = [startingViewController]
        self.setViewControllers(viewControllers as [AnyObject], direction: UIPageViewControllerNavigationDirection.Forward, animated: false, completion: nil)
    }

    func viewControllerAtIndex(index: Int) -> UINavigationController! {

        let storyBoard : UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle:nil)
        //first view controller = firstViewControllers navigation controller
        if index == 0 {

            return storyBoard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("FirstNavigationController") as! UINavigationController

        }

        //second view controller = secondViewController's navigation controller
        if index == 1 {

            return storyBoard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("SecondNavigationController") as! UINavigationController

        return nil
    }
    func pageViewController(pageViewController: UIPageViewController, viewControllerAfterViewController viewController: UIViewController) -> UIViewController? {

@LINK:/questions/30915114/recursion-over-a-swift-sliceable
@TITLE:Recursion over a Swift Sliceable
@CONTENT:I feel that I must be missing something obvious. Decomposing a list into the head and tail and then recursing over the tail is a standard functional programming technique, yet I'm struggling to do this for Sliceable types in Swift. I have a recursive function that follows this pattern: func recurseArray(arr: [Int]) -> [Int] {

    guard let first = arr.first else {
        return []
    }

    let rest = recurseArray(Array(dropFirst(arr)))
    let next = rest.first ?? 0

    return [first + next] + rest

}
 Obviously the real code does a lot more than add each number to the next. Note the call to Array(dropFirst(seq)). Converting to an Array is required since dropFirst actually returns an ArraySlice, and an ArraySlice isn't a Sliceable, so I can't pass it to my function. I'm not sure what sort of optimization the compiler is capable of here, but it seems to me that creating a new array from a SubSlice unnecessarily won't be optimal. Is there a solution to this? Furthermore, what I'd really like to do is create a version of this function that can take any Sliceable type: func recurseSeq<T: Sliceable where T.Generator.Element == Int>(list: T) -> [Int] {

    guard let first = list.first else {
        return []
    }

    let rest = recurseSeq(dropFirst(list)) // <- Error - cannot invoke with argument type T.SubSlice
    let next = rest.first ?? 0

    return [first + next] + rest
}
 This time I don't have a solution to the fact that I have a SubSlice. How can I achieve my goal?
@CODE:Sliceable func recurseArray(arr: [Int]) -> [Int] {

    guard let first = arr.first else {
        return []
    }

    let rest = recurseArray(Array(dropFirst(arr)))
    let next = rest.first ?? 0

    return [first + next] + rest

} Array(dropFirst(seq)) dropFirst ArraySlice ArraySlice Sliceable SubSlice Sliceable func recurseSeq<T: Sliceable where T.Generator.Element == Int>(list: T) -> [Int] {

    guard let first = list.first else {
        return []
    }

    let rest = recurseSeq(dropFirst(list)) // <- Error - cannot invoke with argument type T.SubSlice
    let next = rest.first ?? 0

    return [first + next] + rest
} SubSlice

@TITLE:`uniq` without sorting an immense text file?
@CONTENT:I have a stupidly large text file (i.e. 40 gigabytes as of today) that I would like to filter for unique lines without sorting the file. The file has unix line endings, and all content matches [[:print:]]. I tried the following awk script to display only unique lines: awk 'a[$0] {next} 1' stupid.txt > less_stupid.txt
 The thought was that I'd populate an array by referencing its elements, using the contents of the file as keys, then skip lines that were already in the array. But this fails for two reasons -- firstly, because it inexplicably just doesn't work (even on small test files), and secondly because I know that my system will run out of memory before the entire set of unique lines is loaded into memory by awk. After searching, I found this answer which recommended: awk '!x[$0]++'
 And while this works on small files, it also will run out of memory before reading my entire file. What's a better (i.e. working) solution? I'm open to just about anything, though I'm more partial to solutions in languages I know (bash & awk, hence the tags). In trying to visualize the problem, the best I've come up with would be to store an array of line checksums or MD5s rather than the lines themselves, but that only saves a little space and runs the risk of checksum collisions. Any tips would be very welcome. Telling me this is impossible would also be welcome, so that I stop trying to figure it out. :-P

@TITLE:Resolving transitive dependency conflicts in Java
@CONTENT:I am trying to build a Dropwizard (Jersey) REST endpoint that communicates with HBase. Although these are my only two top-level dependencies, both of these dependencies come loaded with many transitive dependencies that conflict. A simple example of such a conflict is Google's Guava: The HBase client specifies version 11 Dropwizard specifies 18 Dropwizard will not work with version 11 and HBase will not work with version 18. I have examined the Maven shade plugin documentation, but it does not seem to let you relocate classes found in dependency jars. So I don't know how to resolve this issue short of separating these two components into separate JVMs.

Print a content without print preview (just silent print) Print once, when softcopy is printed then the softcopy is expired because I want to avoid reprint the softcopy more than one by the user for security reason, especially if that is receipt is for reimburstment. that is simple or not? Reason why we won't show the print preview because there is possibility that user could screenshot the file then photoshop the file values change the contents can duplicate copy In that way it is difficult to monitor who printed the sensitive file in online.

 Am I doing something wrong? How can I fix this? I think there might be a problem with my subscriber registration, but I'm not sure. EDIT: I've just figured out that if I remove the subscribers and the register, and then re-add them, they'll dequeue all messages. Howerver if another event gets enqueued, it stays there indefinetly (or until I remove and add the subscribers again): The record with state 0 and no DEQ_TIME is the new one. Do I need a scheduler or something like that? EDIT: I've added a scheduler propagation to my AQ: DBMS_AQADM.SCHEDULE_PROPAGATION('ITEM_EVENT_QUEUE');
 and even added the next_time field: DBMS_AQADM.SCHEDULE_PROPAGATION('ITEM_EVENT_QUEUE', SYSDATE + 30/86400);
 Still doesn't work. Any suggestions? I guess the AQ Notifications aren't working, and my callback procedure is never called. How can I fix this? EDIT: I've removed my procedure from the package just for testing purposes, so my team mates can compile the ITEM_API package (I don't know if recompiling the package, may or may not have impacts on the dequeue process). Still doesn't work.

@TITLE:Is there a general inverse of the table() function?
@CONTENT:I am aware that a little programming allows converting fixed-dimension frequency tables, as returned e.g. by table(), back into observation data. So the aim is to convert a frequency table such as this one... (flower.freqs <- with(iris,table(Petal=cut(Petal.Width,2),Species)))
          Species
Petal          setosa versicolor virginica
  (0.0976,1.3]     50         28         0
  (1.3,2.5]         0         22        50
 ...back into a data.frame() with a row number that corresponds to the sum of the numbers of the input matrix, while the cell values are obtained from input dimensions:      Petal Species
1 (0.0976,1.3]  setosa
2 (0.0976,1.3]  setosa
3 (0.0976,1.3]  setosa
# ... (150 rows) ...
 With some tinkering I build a rough prototype that should also digest higher-dimensional inputs: tableinv <- untable <- function(x) {
    stopifnot(is.table(x))
    obs <- as.data.frame(x)[rep(1:prod(dim(x)),c(x)),-length(dim(x))-1]
    rownames(obs) <- NULL; obs
}

 I am obviously proud that this bricolage reconstructs multi-attribute data.frame()s from higher-dimensional frequency tables such as Titanic - but is there an established (built-in, battle-tested) general inverse to table(), ideally one that does not depend on a specific library, that knows how to handle unlabeled dimensions, that is optimized so that it will not choke on bulky inputs, and that reasonably deals with table inputs that would correspond to factor as well as non-factor observation inputs?

 Visual Studio 2013 picks this up fine and the NuGet package manager installs packages into the specified folder, lists installed packages correctly, etc. In Visual Studio 2015 RC the NuGet package manager pops up the "Some packages are missing from this solution, click here to restore" message and if I click the button it creates a new packages folder in the same folder as the solution rather than using the location specified in the nuget.config. Installing a completely new package also puts it into a packages folder under the solution folder rather than the specified one. How do I get Visual Studio 2015 RC to respect the repository path specified in the nuget.config?

@TITLE:Branch and predicated instructions
@CONTENT:Section 5.4.2 of the CUDA C Programming Guide states that branch divergence is handled either by "branch instructions" or, under certain conditions, "predicated instructions". I don't understand the difference between the two, and why one leads to better performance than the other. This comment suggests that branch instructions lead to a greater number of executed instructions, stalling due to "branch address resolution and fetch", and overhead due to "the branch itself" and "book keeping for divergence", while predicated instructions incur only the "instruction execution latency to do the condition test and set the predicate". Why?

@TITLE:performing vector intersection in C++
@CONTENT:I have a vector of vector of unsigned. I need to find the intersection of all these vector of unsigned's for doing so I wrote the following code: int func()
{
   vector<vector<unsigned> > t;
   vector<unsigned> intersectedValues;
   bool firstIntersection=true;
   for(int i=0;i<(t).size();i++)
   {
       if(firstIntersection)
       {
           intersectedValues=t[0];
           firstIntersection=false;
       }else{
           vector<unsigned> tempIntersectedSubjects;                                                              
           set_intersection(t[i].begin(),
                  t[i].end(), intersectedValues.begin(),
                  intersectedValues.end(),
                  std::inserter(tempIntersectedSubjects, tempIntersectedSubjects.begin()));
           intersectedValues=tempIntersectedSubjects;
       }         
       if(intersectedValues.size()==0)
           break;
   }               
}
 Each individual vector has 9000 elements and there are many such vectors in "t". When I profiled my code I found that set_intersection takes the maximum amount of time and hence makes the code slow when there are many invocations of func(). Can someone please suggest as to how can I make the code more efficient. I am using: gcc (GCC) 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15) EDIT: Individual vectors in vector "t" are sorted.

   vector<vector<unsigned> > t;

@CONTENT:RDD transformations and actions can only be invoked by the driver, not inside of other transformations; for example, rdd1.map(x => rdd2.values.count() * x) is invalid because the values transformation and count action cannot be performed inside of the rdd1.map transformation. For more information, see SPARK-5063. As the error says, i'm trying to map(transformation) a JavaRDD object within the main map function, how is it possible with Apache Spark? The main JavaPairRDD object (TextFile and Word are defined classes): JavaPairRDD<TextFile, JavaRDD<Word>> filesWithWords = new...
 and map function: filesWithWords.map(textFileJavaRDDTuple2 -> textFileJavaRDDTuple2._2().map(word -> new Word(word.getText(), (long) textFileJavaRDDTuple2._1().getText().split(word.getText()).length)));
 also i tried foreach instead map function, but not working. (And of course searched SPARK-5063)
@CODE:JavaPairRDD<TextFile, JavaRDD<Word>> filesWithWords = new... filesWithWords.map(textFileJavaRDDTuple2 -> textFileJavaRDDTuple2._2().map(word -> new Word(word.getText(), (long) textFileJavaRDDTuple2._1().getText().split(word.getText()).length)));

@TITLE:Problems with dynamic loading in JavaScript
@CONTENT:I am a JavaScript newbie and learn by working on a pure JavaScript "project" that calculates mathematical functions. It all works well. Now, as a further step, I want to make the messaging multilingual. The code should be capable of loading the appropriate language file at runtime. For the dynamic loading issue, I read and found solutions on Web pages like this one. Before writing the dynamic code, I loaded it statically and the test code worked well. The code I am asking for help about is just making the minor difference of loading a "script" element. The code where I run into problems is the this.getString function, where it is not possible to access the de element in the language file. At line console.log(eval(language, tag));, I get the error message "Uncaught ReferenceError: de is not defined". //File: Utils/Lang/js/FileUtils.js
function Language(language) {
    var __construct = function(dynamicLoad) {
        if (typeof language == 'undefined') {
            language = "en";
        }
        // Load the proper language file:
        loadFile("js/resources/lang.de.js");
        return;
    } ()

    this.getString = function(tag, strDefault) {
        console.log("getString(" + tag + ", " + strDefault + "): ");
        console.log("getString(...): document = " + document);
        console.log("getString(...): eval(" + language + ", " + tag + ") = ");
        console.log(eval(language, tag));
        var strReturn = eval('eval(language).' + tag);

        if (typeof strReturn != 'undefined') {
            return strReturn;
        } else {
            return (typeof strDefault != 'undefined')

                    : eval('en.' + tag);
        }
    }
}
 The static test code that works is not included, where I can access the de element. My question: How to load the language file properly so that the de tag is accessible? Thank you for your help!  //File: Utils/Files/js/FileUtils.js

@TITLE:CLion: Error:The C compiler ：C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe； is not able to compile a simple test program
@CONTENT:I'm trying to run CLion on windows 7 with MinGW but for some reason CMake can't compile the simple test program but when I create a simple hello world file it compiles just fine when I call the compiler directly instead of CMake. I already tried several versions of MinGW but it makes no difference on the error. I even uninstalled my AV to see if that was the problem but once again nothing changed at all. I have MinGW in my path and CMake as well. At first I thought it maybe was a problem with permissions on the TEMP folder but they all seem fine. I'm on an administrator account as well. This is the error I get in CLion: Error:The C compiler "C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe" is not able to compile a simple test program.
It fails with the following output:

The code will compile, but then when this line of code hits:     var cell:MessageCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier("messageCell") as! MessageCell

    let message = messagesArray[indexPath.row]["Message"] as? String

 I am showing 2 fields but have several more. I need to sum the metrics grouped by each field e.g. for field1: DF %>% group_by(field1) %>% summarise_each(funs(sum),metric1,metric2,metric3)
 I can do this for each field where the columns would be sum(metric1), sum(metric2), sum(metric3), but the table output I need is something like this: L(field1) S(field1) S1(field2)  S2(field2) S3(field2)  S4(field2)
sum(metric1)

sum(metric2)

sum(metric3)
 I believe there must be a way to do this using tidyr along with dplyr but cannot figure it out

kombu>=3.0.8

 or: >>> import package_deps

>>> print package.dependencies
['kombu>=3.0.8', 'billiard>=3.3.0.13', 'boto>=2.26']
 Note, I'm not talking about importing a package and finding all referenced modules. While this might find most of the dependent packages, it wouldn't be able to find the minimum version number required. That's only stored in the setup.py.
@CODE:setup.py $ pip install somepackage --only-list-deps

          Map map = new HashMap ();

          for (Map.Entry entry : set) {} // fine

}
 I am getting a compilation error about a Type incompatibility, namely: "Object cannot be cast to Entry". Ideone for convenience Why is the iterator over entrySet() losing the type information if there's no variable storing it again? The rawtypes shouldn't affect the type so that Map.Entry suddenly is an Object. Or am I mistaken?

@LINK:/questions/29410329/create-a-slanted-edge-to-a-div
@TITLE:Create a slanted edge to a div
@CONTENT:Im trying to create a slanted div, and everywhere I have looked I have just found how to do it using a border of some sorts, which will not work because the div will be places over the top of an image. So the code at the moment is as follows using Bootstrap: <div class="thumbnail">
    <a href="#">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="banner.jpg">
        <h3 class="headline-badge">slanted div text</h3>
    </a>
</div>
 And this is the relevant CSS: .thumbnail img.img-responsive {
    width: 100%;
    border-top-left-radius: 4px;
    border-top-right-radius: 4px;
}

.headline-badge {
    color: #fff;
    margin-top: 0;
    padding: 2%;
    position: absolute; 
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: #000;
}
 So I want to create a slant towards the top right. I tried using a border with little or no success, and whenever I tried to make the border transparent it wouldn't display the border. Does anyone have any ideas about how to create this using CSS? I believe it should also be responsive which is a major issue as the slant cannot just be a fixed height/width. The slant should be around 45 degrees, and only on the right hand side of the div. The text shouldn't be effected by the slant. The effect should be similar to this: http://jsfiddle.net/webtiki/yLu1sxmj/ Thanks for posting this fiddle, but I need to actually add text to the div, and your solution makes it difficult to do this as the comments in reply suggest. The slant would also need to be slanting upwards, not downwards, and I struggled to do this without effecting the left of the div. With your example I couldn't figure out how to add text on top of the div though I'm afraid.
@CODE:<div class="thumbnail">
    <a href="#">

@LINK:/questions/29401626/encapsulation-and-refcell
@TITLE:Encapsulation and RefCell
@CONTENT:I have a struct that has inner mutability. use std::cell::RefCell;

struct MutableInterior {
    hideMe: i32,
    vec: Vec<i32>,
}
struct Foo {
//although not used in this particular snippet,
//the motivating problem uses interior mutability
//via RefCell.
   interior: RefCell<MutableInterior>, 
}

impl Foo {
    pub fn getItems(&self) -> &Vec<i32> {
        &self.interior.borrow().vec
    }
}

fn main() {
   let f = Foo { interior: RefCell::new(MutableInterior{ vec: Vec::new(), hideMe: 2 })};
   let borrowed_f = &f;
   let items = borrowed_f.getItems();
}
 whoops: <anon>:17:10: 17:32 error: borrowed value does not live long enough
<anon>:17         &self.interior.borrow().vec
                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 So the problem here is that I can't have a function on Foo that returns a borrowed vec, because the borrowed vec is only valid for the lifetime of the Ref, but the Ref goes out of scope immediately. I think the Ref must stick around because: RefCell uses Rust's lifetimes to implement 'dynamic borrowing', a process whereby one can claim temporary, exclusive, mutable access to the inner value. Borrows for RefCells are tracked 'at runtime', unlike Rust's native reference types which are entirely tracked statically, at compile time. Because RefCell borrows are dynamic it is possible to attempt to borrow a value that is already mutably borrowed; when this happens it results in task panic. Now I could instead write a function like this that returns the entire interior: pub fn getMutableInterior(&self) -> std::cell::Ref<MutableInterior>;
 However this potentially exposes fields (MutableInterior.hideMe in this example) that are really private implementation details to Foo. Ideally I just want to expose the vec itself, potentially with a guard to implement the dynamic borrowing behavior. Then callers do not have to find out about hideMe.
@CODE:use std::cell::RefCell;

struct MutableInterior {
    hideMe: i32,
    vec: Vec<i32>,
}
struct Foo {
//although not used in this particular snippet,
//the motivating problem uses interior mutability
//via RefCell.
   interior: RefCell<MutableInterior>, 
}

impl Foo {
    pub fn getItems(&self) -> &Vec<i32> {
        &self.interior.borrow().vec
    }
}

fn main() {
   let f = Foo { interior: RefCell::new(MutableInterior{ vec: Vec::new(), hideMe: 2 })};
   let borrowed_f = &f;
   let items = borrowed_f.getItems();

@TITLE:When does Rails respond with 'transfer-encoding' vs. 'content-length'?
@CONTENT:I'm building an API on Rails version 4.1.7/Nginx that responds to request from an iOS app. We're seeing some weird caching on the client and we think it has something to do with a small difference in the response that Rails is sending back. My questions... 1) I want to understand why, for the exact same request (with only the Authorization header value changed), Rails sends back transfer-encoding: chunked sometimes and Content-Length: <number> sometimes? I thought that maybe it had something to do with the response size, but in the example responses whose headers I've pasted below, the data returned in the body is EXACTLY the same. 2) Is there a way to force it to use Content-Length? We think that that will fix our caching issues in our iOS app. Response #1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

@LINK:/questions/29111320/using-flag-activity-reorder-to-front-to-switch-among-persistently-running-ui-act
@TITLE:Using FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT to switch among persistently running UI activities leads to ：no window focus； error
@CONTENT:My objective is to keep two UI activities alive and to switch back and forth between them at will without having to kill/restart either of them. But there is a serious side effect of using FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT to do this: a loss of window focus when I resume a previous activity (that is currently running in the background). I proved this issue by spending 5 minutes creating a simple application with two "Hello World" activities. The app starts with Activity A, which simply shows a button (nothing else) called "Launch B". Press this button -- this executes startActivity(FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT, ActivityB.class). Activity B becomes active, which shows simply shows a button called "Launch A". Press this button -- this executes startActivity(FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT, ActivityA.class). Activity A's onResume() is called as expected and everything looks fine (I can see Activity A content again). Press the device's Back key and this set of errors will occur 100% of the time: E/ActivityManager( 513): Reason: Input dispatching timed out (Waiting because no window has focus but there is a focused application that may eventually add a window when it finishes starting up.) I/WindowState( 513): WIN DEATH: Window{5294687c u0 com.android.launcher/com.android.launcher2.Launcher} W/ViewRootImpl( 8066): Dropping event due to no window focus: KeyEvent { action=ACTION_DOWN, keyCode=KEYCODE_BACK, scanCode=0, metaState=0, flags=0xc8, repeatCount=1, eventTime=14965546, downTime=14965045, deviceId=-1, source=0x101 } (The practical result of the window death is essentially a "crash" from the user's point of view -- Android throws the user out of the app back to the Home screen, though technically the application remains running in the background.) I debugged this and found that the reason Activity A is visible but doesn't have focus is because activity A's onWindowFocusChanged() is NOT called like it normally does (even though onResume() is called). This has something to do with the fact with Activity B is still active in the background (even though clearly B has lost focus -- onWindowFocusChanged(false) was called for B, as well as onStop()). I know this because after step 4 above if I immediately call finish() on Activity B, Activity A's onWindowFocusChanged(true) WILL be called and everything is normal. The fact that Activity B is still active but not focused somehow interferes with Activity A regaining focus like it should. Is this an Android bug or am I missing something? Note that if Activity A had multiple views in it and I were to touch one of those views after step 6 above, I would get the same "Dropping event due to no window focus" error, though not 100% of the time for some reason.

@CONTENT:How specifically does JavaScript understand the construct <!--? From the point of view of JavaScript, is it yet another comment in addition to // and /* */? From testing it seems that JavaSript treats <!-- like //: a one-liner <script> <!-- alert('hi') //--> </script>
 does nothing, while <script> <!-- 
alert('hi') //--> </script>
 works as expected. Where is this behavior documented? This is not a duplicate of other questions: I don't ask why or whether or how it should be used. I ask what syntax and semantics it has in JavaScript, formally. The question is non-trivial and is not answered in other questions: for example, the behavior indicated above cannot be guessed from the other questions and their answers (in fact this was my motivation: my program with a one-liner as above did not work, and those questions and answers were no help in understanding why).

The class A uses the class B from FrameworkB (which is linked in FrameworkA). This works just fine in the simulator, but it does not work on the device. The structure may seem a bit strange, but I am developing the frameworks as I go when I develop the app, which is why I want to add the framework projects inside my app project. I have uploaded the project on GitHub for you to see, if you need to take a closer look. (The class A is invoked in the AppDelegate.m file) Why is this working in the iOS simulator and not on the device? And how can I make it work on the device? EDIT: As simonthumper suggests in the comments, I have also tried to add FrameworkB.framework to Copy Files as Frameworks destination in Build Phases for FrameworkA, but that gives me this error in the console: dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/FrameworkB.framework/FrameworkB Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/2A38A2BC-9CD7-4AF6-9E50-42C16D92D6B2/FrameworkTest.app/Frameworks/FrameworkA.framework/FrameworkA Reason: no suitable image found.

@TITLE:Transforming a Javascript iterator into an array
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the new Map object from Javascript EC6, since it's already supported in the latest Firefox and Chrome versions. But I'm finding it very limited in "functional" programming, because it lacks classic map, filter etc. methods that would work nicely with a [key, value] pair. It has a forEach but that does NOT returns the callback result. If I could transform its map.entries() from a MapIterator into a simple Array I could then use the standard .map, .filter with no additional hacks. Is there a "good" way to transform a Javascript Iterator into an Array? In python it's as easy as doing list(iterator)... but Array(m.entries()) return an array with the Iterator as its first element!!! EDIT I forgot to specify I'm looking for an answer which works wherever Map works, which means at least Chrome and Firefox (Array.from does not work in Chrome). PS. I know there's the fantastic wu.js but its dependency on traceur puts me off...

@TITLE:Implicit conversion from int to shared_ptr
@CONTENT:Consider the code below: #include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void f(std::shared_ptr<int> sp) {}

template <typename FuncType, typename PtrType>
auto call_f(FuncType f, PtrType p) -> decltype(f(p))
{
    return f(p);
}

int main()
{
    f(0); // doesn't work for any other int != 0, thanks @Rupesh
    // call_f(f, 0); // error, cannot convert int to shared_ptr
}
 In the first line in main(), the integer 0 is converted to a std::shared_ptr<int> and the call f(0) succeeds without any problem. However, using a template to call the function make matter different. Second line will not compile anymore, the error being error: could not convert 'p' from 'int' to 'std::shared_ptr<int>'
 My questions are: Why does the first call succeed and the second doesn't? Is there anything I'm missing here? I don't understand also how the conversion from int to std::shared_ptr is being performed in the call f(0), as it looks like std::shared_ptr has only explicit constructors. PS: A variant of this example appears in Scott Meyers' Effective Modern C++ Item 8, as a way of protecting such calls with nullptr.

@TITLE:Raw Node.js without any web framework [closed]
@CONTENT:I'm trying to learn node, I saw lot of material (as suggested in that famous SO question), the problem is that all the books I saw, or tutorials either use a web framework like express or simply limit themselves to explain what node is and go no deeper than explaining how to create a very basic http server which listens for requests on some port. So I'm really wondering is there anybody who uses node w/o a web framework? If so they must have learned it somewhere, so could you please suggest where can I learn it? I know that this is very low level, but I don't mind, I have already a familiarity on how to create servers in C. I'd really like to understand how we really serve static content with node (customly organized in folders) and how we actually introduce logic into our html (I looked all this up but found only results on how to do it using Express, where logic is introduced by something like <% //code %>, but can this be done in pure node?). The question similar to mine which has been already asked here does not really have an answer. The best answer just suggests to read the official nodejs documentation which is like saying: there you have a dictionary with millions of words in Latin, good luck in learning it. So can you suggest some well documented, robust book/ tutorial where is shown how to create a real world website using raw node? If not, I guess I'll have to stick to php + Apache and try to optimize those to scale.

@LINK:/questions/28465362/svn-tree-conflict-merging-renamed-folder
@TITLE:svn tree conflict merging renamed folder
@CONTENT:So I'm using TortoiseSVN to try to merge my latest trunk into branch-B. The trunk recently had branch-A reintegrated which contained a renaming of a subfolder, as well as some revisions to files within that subfolder. Branch-B also contains some different revisions to those files within that subfolder, which still has the original name. Now, when trying to merge the latest trunk into branch-B, svn simply adds the newly named folder and throws a tree conflict on the originally named folder. In other words, the revisions to the files themselves never get merged and I'm left with both folders. I've tried multiple things in hopes of getting the cleanest merge possible, while retaining all the appropriate svn:mergeinfo, but nothing seems to work. Does anybody know the correct way to go about completing this merge cleanly? TortoiseSVN 1.8.10, Subversion 1.8.11 Here's a visual: /trunk (before reintegrating branch-A)
  /Folder1
    file1
    file2
    file3

/trunk (after reintegrating branch-A)
  /Folder1-Renamed
    file1-change1
    file2-change1
    file3

/branch-B
  /Folder1
    file1-change2
    file2-change2
    file3
 tl;dr: How do I cleanly merge the trunk into branch-B? Thanks!

@TITLE:Find maximum length of good path in a grid
@CONTENT:Given is a N*N grid.Now we need to find a good path of maximum length , where good path is defined as follow : Good path always start from a cell marked as 0 We are only allowed to move Left,Right,Up Or Down If the value of ith cell is say A, then value of next cell in the path must be A+1. Now given these few conditions, I need to find out the length of maximum path that can be made. Also I need to count such paths that are of maximum length. Example : Let N=3 and we have 3*3 matrix as follow : 0 3 2               
3 0 1               
2 1 0

 I have referred the following links to sort out the issue which says, if my activity and service are in separate processes then we should not bind the way I have done. Android service android.os.BinderProxy error java.lang.ClassCastException: android.os.BinderProxy cannot be cast to LocalBinder But in my case: I am binding to SecondService from MainApplication and both are running in same Process(i.e Default Application Process). Still I am facing binderProxy exception in SecondService , And my FirstService runs in separate process which I am not even binding to. Please help me out with this situation and, Suggest me a best possible way so that I can implement same scenario without any crash.

@TITLE:Performance issues for spark on YARN
@CONTENT:We are trying to run our spark cluster on yarn. We are having some performance issues especially when compared to the standalone mode. We have a cluster of 5 nodes with each having 16GB RAM and 8 cores each. We have configured the minimum container size as 3GB and maximum as 14GB in yarn-site.xml. When submitting the job to yarn-cluster we supply number of executor = 10, memory of executor =14 GB. According to my understanding our job should be allocated 4 container of 14GB. But the spark UI shows only 3 container of 7.2GB each. We are unable to ensure the container number and resources allocated to it. This causes detrimental performance when compared to the standalone mode. Can you drop any pointer on how to optimize yarn performance? This is the command I use for submitting the job: $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class "MyApp" --master yarn-cluster --num-executors 10 --executor-memory 14g  target/scala-2.10/my-application_2.10-1.0.jar  
 Following the discussion I changed my yarn-site.xml file and also the spark-submit command. Here is the new yarn-site.xml code : <property>
<name>yarn.resourcemanager.hostname</name>
<value>hm41</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</name>
<value>14336</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb</name>
<value>2560</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb</name>
<value>13312</value>
</property>
 And the new command for spark submit is $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class "MyApp" --master yarn-cluster --num-executors 4 --executor-memory  10g --executor-cores 6   target/scala-2.10/my-application_2.10-1.0.jar 
 With this I am able to get 6 cores on each machine but the memory usage of each node is still around 5G. I have attached the screen shot of SPARKUI and htop.

hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 48 45 4c 4c 4f 57 4f 52 4c 44
hciconfig hci0 leadv
 Which gives me this output: LE set advertise enable on hci0 returned status 12 
< HCI Command: ogf 0x08, ocf 0x0008, plen 10 
48 45 4C 4C 4F 57 4F 52 4C 44 
> HCI Event: 0x0e plen 4 
01 08 20 12 
 Note that I can't use the advised command hciconfig hci0 leadv 0 because it will throw the error Warning: unknown command - "0". However, when I try to read out (e.g. with a hcidump --raw) the payload in the advertised package from another device I'm getting an output like this: hcitool lescan -- duplicates output snippet (both entries are repeated over and over again, looking at the MAC it should be the same device, though): 00:1A:7D:DA:71:14 mint17-0
00:1A:7D:DA:71:14 (unknown)
 matching hcidump --raw output snippet: > 04 3E 16 02 01 04 00 14 71 DA 7D 1A 00 0A 09 09 6D 69 6E 74 31 37 2D 30 BE

 I'm using Bluez 5.26 and CSR4.0 dongles. This is the hciconfig output of the advertisier: hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB

 And this is the hciconfig output from the 'scanner': hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB

 What did I miss to get it to work? Update: Following David's advice I changed the cmd values to hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 10 02 01 1a 0c ff 18 01 48 45 4c 4c 4f 57 4f 52 4c 44
 getting this output < HCI Command: ogf 0x08, ocf 0x0008, plen 18

 Update 2: Following the next advice I tried adding some 00 to the payload: < HCI Command: ogf 0x08, ocf 0x0008, plen 42
  10 02 01 1A 0C FF 18 01 48 45 4C 4C 4F 57 4F 52 4C 44 00 00

 So still no joy. Would it make sense to try a different (maybe older) version of bluez? Or can it be hardware related and I should try to get different Bluetooth dongles? Update 3: Tried the same with bluez 5.21 which works for David. Here's a snippet of the hcidump --raw output > 04 3E 0C 02 01 04 00 14 71 DA 7D 1A 00 00 D7

 The hostname has changed (tested on the third machine so far), so the output is a bit different but I still don't see 'hello world' anywhere. At this point any ideas are more than welcome! Update 4: Tried a different hardware dongle (IOGEAR GBU521W6 as suggested by David) and this looks very promising now! When using this advertising config: hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 10 02 01 1a 0c ff 18 01 48 45 4c 4c 4f 57 4f 52 4c 44
 I get this hcidump --raw output: > 04 3E 1C 02 01 00 00 BA D0 63 70 F3 5C 10 02 01 1A 0C FF 18 01 48 45 4C 4C 4F 57 4F 52 4C B5
 As you can see the payload is almost complete, but the last char is missing. By changing the length attribute to 11 I get the full payload: hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 11 02 01 1a 0c ff 18 01 48 45 4c 4c 4f 57 4f 52 4c 44

 So for the future (and different payloads): the required length seems to be the bytes of the payload (without the length attribute) - 17 in this case. Important: It does not work with bluez 5.26 for me, I'm using bluez 5.21 now.

@TITLE:How to performance test an AngularJS Web Application?
@CONTENT:I used to do performance testing on websites mostly with JMeter scripts. However, more and more projects are build with frontend MVC's, such as AngularJS and a current project is loading all of it's content via angular view files, REST calls etc. Unfortunately, JMeter doesn't execute any javascript thus my load test return me the homepage in just (400ms). In real, it actually takes several seconds to load in a browser. When I check the response data, it does not contain any data yet due to Angular. Instead of investigating the network traffic and individually loading each component (e.g. profile.html, notification.html, REST calls etc. ). Is there a product on the market or some best case I could follow that is similar to executing JMeter scripts, but considering javascript execution and loading of external resources due to javascript? (I am not planning to profile javascript execution times. This is still to test if the infrastructure behind is capable serving xyz simultaneous users)

@CONTENT:I am using _ as placeholder for creating anonymous function, and the problem is I cannot predict how Scala is going to transform my code. More precisely, it mistakenly determines how "large" the anonymous function I want.  List(1,2,3) foreach println(_:Int)   //error !
 List(1,2,3) foreach (println(_:Int)) //work
 List(1,2,3) foreach(println(_:Int))  //work
 Using -Xprint:typer I can see Scala transforms the first one into "a big anonymous function": x$1 => List(1,2,3) foreach(println(x$1:Int))
 the worked 2th 3th are right transformation into what I want. ... foreach (x$1 => println(x$1:Int))

@LINK:/questions/28008564/streaming-mp4-in-chrome-with-rails-nginx-and-send-file
@TITLE:Streaming mp4 in Chrome with rails, nginx and send_file
@CONTENT:I can't for the life of me stream a mp4 to Chrome with a html5 <video> tag. If I drop the file in public then everything is gravy and works as expected. But if I try to serve it using send_file, pretty much everything imaginable goes wrong. I am using a rails app that is proxied by nginx, with a Video model that has a location attribute that is an absolute path on disk. At first I tried: def show
  send_file Video.find(params[:id]).location
end
 And I was sure I would be basking in the glory that is modern web development. Ha. This plays in both Chrome and Firefox, but neither seek and neither have any idea how long the video is. I poked at the response headers and realized that Content-Type is being sent as application/octet-stream and there is no Content-Length set. Umm... wth? Okay, I guess I can set those in rails: def show
  video = Video.find(params[:id])
  response.headers['Content-Length'] = File.stat(video.location).size
  send_file(video.location, type: 'video/mp4')
end
 At this point everything works pretty much as expected in Firefox. It knows how long the video is and seeking works as expected. Chrome appears to know how long the video is (doesn't show timestamps, but seek bar looks appropriate) but seeking doesn't work. Apparently Chrome is pickier than Firefox. It requires that the server respond with a Accept-Ranges header with value bytes and respond to subsequent requests (that happen when the users seeks) with 206 and the appropriate portion of the file. Okay, so I borrowed some code from here and then I had this: video = Video.find(params[:id])

file_begin = 0
file_size = File.stat(video.location).size
file_end = file_size - 1

if !request.headers["Range"]
  status_code = :ok
else
  status_code = :partial_content
  match = request.headers['Range'].match(/bytes=(\d+)-(\d*)/)
  if match
    file_begin = match[1]
    file_end = match[2] if match[2] && !match[2].empty?
  end
  response.header["Content-Range"] = "bytes " + file_begin.to_s + "-" + file_end.to_s + "/" + file_size.to_s
end
response.header["Content-Length"] = (file_end.to_i - file_begin.to_i + 1).to_s
response.header["Accept-Ranges"]=  "bytes"
response.header["Content-Transfer-Encoding"] = "binary"
send_file(video.location,
:filename => File.basename(video.location),
:type => 'video/mp4',
:disposition => "inline",
:status => status_code,
:stream =>  'true',
:buffer_size  =>  4096)
 Now Chrome attempts to seek, but when you do the video stops playing and never works again until the page reloads. Argh. So I decided to play around with curl to see what was happening and I discovered this: $ curl --header "Range: bytes=200-400" http://localhost:8080/videos/1/001.mp4 ftypisomisomiso2avc1mp41 ?moovlmvhd??@??trak\tkh?? $ curl --header "Range: bytes=1200-1400" http://localhost:8080/videos/1/001.mp4 ftypisomisomiso2avc1mp41 ?moovlmvhd??@??trak\tkh?? No matter the byte range request, the data always starts from the beginning of the file. The appropriate amount of bytes is returned (201 bytes in this case), but it's always from the beginning of the file. Apparently nginx respects the Content-Length header but ignores the Content-Range header. My nginx.conf is untouched default: user www-data;
worker_processes 4;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {

 First I tried the nginx 1.4.x that comes with Ubuntu 14.04, then tried 1.7.x from a ppa - same results. I even tried apache2 and had exactly the same results. I would like to reiterate that the video file is not the problem. If I drop it in public then nginx serves it with the appropriate mime types, headers and everything needed for Chrome to work properly. So my question is a two-parter: Why doesn't nginx/apache handle all this stuff automagically with send_file (X-Accel-Redirect/X-Sendfile) like it does when the file is served statically from public? Handling this stuff in rails is so backwards. How the heck can I actually use send_file with nginx (or apache) so that Chrome will be happy and allow seeking? Update 1 Okay, so I thought I'd try to take the complication of rails out of the picture and just see if I could get nginx to proxy the file correctly. So I spun up a dead-simple nodjs server: var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
res.writeHead(200, {
    'X-Accel-Redirect': '/path/to/file.mp4'
});
res.end();
}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
 And chrome is happy as a clam. =/ curl -I even shows that Accept-Ranges: bytes and Content-Type: video/mp4 is being inserted by nginx automagically - as it should be. What could rails be doing that's preventing nginx from doing this? Update 2 I might be getting closer... If I have: def show
  video = Video.find(params[:id])
  send_file video.location
end
 Then I get: $ curl -I localhost:8080/videos/1/001.mp4
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.7.9

 And everything works perfectly. But why? Those should do exactly the same thing. And why doesn't nginx set Content-Type automagically here like it does for the simple nodejs example? I have config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header = 'X-Accel-Redirect' set. I have moved it back and forth between application.rb and development.rb with the same results. I guess I never mentioned... this is rails 4.2.0. Update 3 Now I've changed my unicorn server to listen on port 3000 (since I already changed nginx to listen on 3000 for the nodejs example). Now I can make requests directly to unicorn (since it's listening on a port and not a socket) so I have found that curl -I directly to unicorn shows that no X-Accel-Redirect header is sent and just curling unicorn directly actually sends the file. It's like send_file isn't doing what it's supposed to.

@TITLE:What is 'Limited Debug Information'? (Full ：Debugging Information" generates huge EXE files)
@CONTENT:I installed Delphi XE7 recently. When I first compiled an old app my jaw dropped when I have seen that the size of the EXE increased with 10MB! Playing in the 'Project options' I discovered that setting the 'Debug information' to 'Limited Debug Information' decreases the EXE size to something VERY close to the EXE generated by Delphi XE. Maybe under Delphi XE7 'Limited Debug Information' is the equivalent of 'Debug Information' from Delphi XE since it results in the same EXE size? So, why full 'Debug information' makes the EXE so big (compared to XE)? I cannot compile the EXE with limited info (I guess) because I want to have full access to the debugging goodies (also EurekaLog needs it). Embarcadero's documentation says nothing about the difference between 'limited' and full debug info. EurekaLog documentation is for an old version of Delphi so it doesn't clearly states if I can use the new option (merciful) 'Limited debug info' or the full debug info. I will have to experiment.

 The error I get when calling ContactMailer.contact_form(@message).deliver_later is: ActiveJob::SerializationError in MessagesController#create

 Ideally I'd like this to be a background process. I will be adding something like Sidekiq soon but I think it's best I get this serialization problem fixed beforehand. Any help is appreciated! Thanks :)

@TITLE:How to establish relationships between Spring Data REST / Spring HATEOAS based (micro) services?
@CONTENT:Trying to figure out a pattern for how to handle relationships when using a hypermedia based microservices based on Spring Data Rest or HATEOAS. If you have service A (Instructor) and Service B (Course) each exist as an a stand alone app. What is the preferred method for establishing a relationship between the two services. In a manner that does not require columns for IDs of the foreign service. It would be possible for each service to have many other services that need to communicate in the same manor. Possible solution (Not sure a correct path) Each service has a second table with a OneToMany with the primary entity within the service. The table would have the following fields: ID, entityID, rel, relatedID Then in the opposite service using Spring Data Rest setup a find that queries the join table to find records that match. The primary goal I want to accomplish would be any service can have relationships with any number of other services without having to have knowledge of the other service.

@CONTENT:I tried what ever was suggested but the output was a white,blank screenshot. Which leads me to assume that I haven't added anything to the view. Here's how I'm adding graphics to my view. The addChild method comes with the SpriteKit and it takes in SKSpriteNodes:   addChild(background)
    addChild(rate)
    addChild(scoreLabel)
    addChild(share)
    addChild(playAgain)
    addChild(highScoreLabel)
    addChild(scoreBackground)
    addChild(highScoreBackground)
 Here's the method that takes the screenshot:     UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(self.view!.bounds.size)
    self.view!.layer.renderInContext(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext())
    let screenshot = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
    UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(screenshot, nil, nil, nil)

@TITLE:How to reload the google recaptcha widget after user submits invalid inputs
@CONTENT:I have a registration form with the new google recaptcha widget on it. When a user submits info, we check the validation with javascript and return the problems to the page (ex: "please use a valid phone number"). however, since the page doesn't reload, when the user enters correct info and goes to submit again (without having to do the recaptcha again)...the recaptcha is no longer valid and they can't submit without reloading the page. is there a good solution to this? can I reload the widget somehow? i tried grecaptcha.render but it didn't really do anything. EDIT: When I try to render the widget again, it says "placeholder element must be empty" I tried emptying the element which seemed to work ($('.g-recaptcha').empty();) and then rendering but it still threw the same error.

 Here, my question is whether there is still room for speeding up the double for-loop calculation. Thank you very much.
@CODE:#### Pseudo data
nobs1 <- 4000
nobs2 <- 5000
mylon1 <- runif(nobs1, min=0, max=1)-76
mylat1 <- runif(nobs1, min=0, max=1)+37
mylon2 <- runif(nobs2, min=0, max=1)-76
mylat2 <- runif(nobs2, min=0, max=1)+37

#### define a distance function
thedistance <- function(lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2) {
 R <- 6371 # Earth mean radius [km]
 delta.lon <- (lon2 - lon1)
 delta.lat <- (lat2 - lat1)
 a <- sin(delta.lat/2)^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(delta.lon/2)^2
 c <- 2 * asin(min(1,sqrt(a)))
 d = R * c
 return(d)
}

ptm <- proc.time()

#### Calculate distances between locations
# Initiate the resulting distance vector
ndistance <- nobs1*nobs2 # The number of distances
mydistance <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = ndistance)

k=1
for (i in 1:nobs1) {
 for (j in 1:nobs2) {
  mydistance[k] = thedistance(mylon1[i],mylat1[i],mylon2[j],mylat2[j])
  k=k+1
 }
}

@TITLE:GWT 2.7 + GAE app looks for codeserver when deployed
@CONTENT:Why does appengine try to use Super Dev Mode? Every time I deploy my GWT app to appengine and try to access it I get the white loading screen, then after about 20-30 seconds I get this message: I use maven with the gwt-maven-plugin and appengine-maven-plugin. Deploying using the maven-gae-plugin gives the same results. If I switch back to using 2.6.1 versions of gwt and the gwt-maven-plugin it deploys ok, so it would seem it's something to do with the automatic dev mode launcher. Some of my pom.xml     <build>

@LINK:/questions/27122612/parse-json-into-oracle-table-using-pl-sql
@TITLE:Parse JSON into Oracle table using PL/SQL
@CONTENT:I have created the following script in order to read data from Mobile App DB (which is based on MongoDB) from Oracle SQL Developer: 
DECLARE
  l_param_list     VARCHAR2(512);

  l_http_request   UTL_HTTP.req;
  l_http_response  UTL_HTTP.resp;

  l_response_text  VARCHAR2(32767);
BEGIN

  -- service's input parameters

  -- preparing Request...
  l_http_request := UTL_HTTP.begin_request ('https://api.appery.io/rest/1/db/collections/Photos?where=%7B%22Oracle_Flag%22%3A%22Y%22%7D'
                                          , 'GET'
                                          , 'HTTP/1.1');

  -- ...set header's attributes
  UTL_HTTP.set_header(l_http_request, 'X-Appery-Database-Id', '53f2dac5e4b02cca64021dbe');
  --UTL_HTTP.set_header(l_http_request, 'Content-Length', LENGTH(l_param_list));

  -- ...set input parameters
 -- UTL_HTTP.write_text(l_http_request, l_param_list);

  -- get Response and obtain received value
  l_http_response := UTL_HTTP.get_response(l_http_request);

  UTL_HTTP.read_text(l_http_response, l_response_text);

  DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line(l_response_text);
  insert into appery values(l_response_text);
  -- finalizing
  UTL_HTTP.end_response(l_http_response);


EXCEPTION
  WHEN UTL_HTTP.end_of_body 
    THEN UTL_HTTP.end_response(l_http_response);  
END;
/ The response (l_response_text) is a JSON-like string. For example: [{"Postcode":"47100","OutletCode":"128039251","MobileNumber":"0123071303","_createdAt":"2014-11-10 06:12:49.837","_updatedAt":"2014-11-10 06:12:49.837"}, {"Postcode":"32100","OutletCode":"118034251", ..... ] The code works fine, and inserts the response into one column-table called appery. However, I need to parse this response such that each array goes into into its specific column in a table called appery_test. The table appery_test has a number of columns same as the number of JSON pairs and in the same order. I searched and I found most of the results about parsing Oracle table into JSON and not the opposite. I found, though, this link which is somewhat similar to my issue. However, the suggested library in the answer does not have any example on how to use it to insert JSON into conventional table using PL/SQL. N.B.: I'm using 11g and not 12c. So the built in functions are not available for me.

@TITLE:Converting URL to String and back again
@CONTENT:So I have converted an NSUrl to a string. So if i printLn it looks like file:///Users/... etc Later i want this back as an NSUrl so I try and convert it back as seen below, but I lose 2 of the forward slashes that appear in the string version above, that in turn breaks the code as the url is invalid. Question is why is my conversion back to NSUrl removing 2 forward slashes from the string iI give it, and how can I convert back to the NSUrl containing 3 forward slashes..? var urlstring: String = recordingsDictionaryArray[selectedRow]["path"] as String
println("the url string = \(urlstring)")
// looks like file:///Users/........etc
var url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(urlstring)
println("the url = \(url!)")
// looks like file:/Users/......etc
@CODE:var urlstring: String = recordingsDictionaryArray[selectedRow]["path"] as String
println("the url string = \(urlstring)")
// looks like file:///Users/........etc
var url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(urlstring)

@TITLE:AppCompat v7 Toolbar Up/Back Arrow Not Working
@CONTENT:I have two fragments in an activity. When fragment A is showing, I want the navigation drawer burger icon to show and the navigation drawer to work. When fragment B is showing, I want the back arrow to show and when it's clicked do an up navigation. However, I can't seem to get the new AppCompat v7 toolbar to show the up arrow at all inside my ActionBarActivity unless the nav drawer is open. In my activity, for my onCreate() method I have... toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar);
if (toolbar != null) {
    setSupportActionBar(toolbar);
}
mDrawerLayout = (DrawerLayout) findViewById(R.id.drawer_layout);
mDrawerToggle = new ActionBarDrawerToggle(this, mDrawerLayout, toolbar, R.string.drawer_open, R.string.drawer_close);
mDrawerLayout.setDrawerListener(mDrawerToggle);
getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(true);
 And then I call mDrawerToggle.syncState(); in my onPostCreate() I've tried searching on how to programatically trigger the toolbar icon to the back arrow but nothing has worked. From what I've gathered, calling getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
getSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(true);
getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(true);
 from my fragment should change the icon but that's not the case. This may be a stupid question, but what am I doing wrong?

@CONTENT:I got a lot of good feedback on a question I recently asked and was guided to use dplyr to transform some data. I'm having an issue with lm() and trying to find a slope from this transformed data and thought I'd open up a new question. First I have data that looks like this: Var1    Var2    Var3    Time           Temp
a       w       j       9/9/2014       20

b       x       L       9/12/2014       30
b       x       L       9/12/2014       10
b       y       k       9/13/2014       20
b       y       k       9/13/2014       15
c       z       j       9/14/2014       20
c       z       j       9/14/2014       10
c       z       k       9/14/2014       11

a       d       k       9/15/2014       4
a       d       l       9/15/2014       23
a       d       k       9/15/2014       11
 And I want it in the form of this (values for Slope and Pearson simulated for illustration): V1  V2  V3  Slope   Pearson
a   w   j   -3      -0.9
a   w   k   2       0
a   d   j   1.5     0.6
a   d   k   0       0.5
a   d   l   -0.5    -0.6
b   x   L   12      0.7
b   y   k   4       0.6
c   z   j   -1      -0.5
c   z   k   -3      -0.4
c   w   l   -10     -0.9
 The slope being a linear-least-squares slope. In theory, the script would look like so: library(dplyr)

data <- read.table("clipboard",sep="\t",quote="",header=T)

newdata = summarise(group_by(data
                              ,Var1
                              ,Var2
                              ,Var3                            
                              )
                     ,Slope = lm(Temp ~ Time)$coeff[2]                 
                     ,Pearson = cor(Time, Temp, method="pearson")
                     )
 But R throws an error like it can't find Time or Temp. It can run lm(data$Temp ~ data$Time)$coeff[2], but returns the slope for the entire data set and not the subsetted form that I'm looking for. cor() seems to run just fine in the group_by section, so is there a specific syntax I need to pass to lm() to have it run in a similar manner or use a different function entirely to get a slope passed from the subset?

@TITLE:Why does my node app process keep getting stopped when I use forever?
@CONTENT:On a free-tier Amazon EC2 instance, I set up a simple node.js Hello World app running on express. If I run npm start, my app runs fine and I can hit it from my browser, and I see the following output: > myappname@0.0.0 start /home/ec2-user/app

 I have installed the forever tool globally. When I run forever start app.js, I see: warn:    --minUptime not set. Defaulting to: 1000ms

@TITLE:What is causing NSNull length unrecognized selector keyCommand error
@CONTENT:I have this class/storyboard scene in a project that up to last night worked fine for the past 4 weeks i worked on it. I have managed to comment out practically everything and I still get the crash when tapping on the UITextField and typing a number. It only crashes when I type in a value, otherwise it doesn't crash. Here is the class as I am running it now: import Foundation
import UIKit
import HealthKit
import CoreData

class WorkoutViewController: UITableViewController {

//Properties
    @IBOutlet var numberOfLapsTextField: UITextField?
    @IBOutlet var metersPerLapTextField: UITextField?
    @IBOutlet var workoutDurationTextField: UITextField?
    @IBOutlet var paceTextField: UITextField?

    var  healthStore:HKHealthStore?

override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
}
 Originally it had the IBOutlets as ! instead of ? And it has a CoreData stack property, some blurred background effects for the tableview background, fetches user's weight from health store on viewDidLoad, a predicate helper method for health store fetches and a cancel and done button. The done button captured data from the textfields, made some computations and saved data to the health store and to coredata. But ALL of this has been commented out leaving only what is seen above. I did managed to get a weird stack trace in the console one time (can't seem to get it anymore) that read: [UIPhysicalKeyboardEvent _matchesKeyCommand:] and a few others like it just before it. Im stumped, any ideas? Exception breakpoints is one but it just throws me to the AppDelegate class declaration line where UIResponder is adopted. Ive learned and rebuilt. I don't know what else to look for. Im thinking its a corrupt storyboard file because Ive added and removed scenes with textfields and they all behave the same. Here is my storyboard.xml file: http://www.santiapps.com/iOS/Main.storyboard.xml
@CODE:import Foundation
import UIKit
import HealthKit
import CoreData

class WorkoutViewController: UITableViewController {

@TITLE:AngularJS smart-table strange behavior with nested objects and st-search
@CONTENT:I'm trying to implement the Smart Table module in my AngularJS app. I'd prefer this over some others mainly because the others seemed require a lot of boilerplate code in my controller and I like to keep my controllers as DRY as possible. But I'm open to other modules that can accomplish the same thing without boilerplate. It works great when dealing with a straight-up array of objects, but if some of those objects have nested objects, the filtering and sorting has strange behavior. This will take some explaining so bear with me. First of all, here is my array of nested objects (shortened for readability here): $scope.products = [
    {
        'display': 'Live',
        'name': 'LC1D09',

        },

        },
        'refurbished': {
            'price': 145
        },
        'onlineStores': {
            'amazon': true,
            'ebay': false
        },

    },
    {

        'category': 'Circuit Breaker',
        'subcategory': 'Molded Case',
        'manufacturer': 'Square D',
        'specs': {
            'phase': 1,
            'poles': 2
        },
        'new': {
            'price': 217.79
        },
        'refurbished': {

            'ebay': true
        },
        'isCool': false
    }
];
$scope.displayedProducts = $scope.products;
 Here's my HTML: <table st-table="displayedProducts" st-safe-src="products" class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th st-sort="name">Name</th>

                    <option value="true">Yes</option>
                    <option value="false">No</option>
                </select>
            </th>
        </tr>

        <tr ng-repeat="product in displayedProducts">

            <td>{{product.onlineStores.ebay}}</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
 So this all works fine if my array doesn't have nested objects. But with the nested objects (eg st-search="new.price" I get the following issues (see the screenshot): Sometimes when I enter text in a "nested object" search field, all other fields that also have nested objects inherit the same value (but the filtering still works fine). This doesn't always do this, just sometimes... Boolean values on nested objects don't compute correctly. True will show all records, but False will show only the record whose value is False. Anybody else figured out how to deal with nested objects and the smart-table module?

 The login method tries to obtain the req.body.userName - however, req.body is always empty. I've seen other cases on SO describing such behavior but none of the related answers did apply here. Thanks for helping out.

@TITLE:Do I really have to explicitly support iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screens?
@CONTENT:I couldn't get used to introduced in Xcode 6 new layout system called Size Classes, so I decided to go by the old way creating two separate xibs for iPhones and iPads with ~iphone and ~ipad suffixes correspondingly. Xibs designed for iPhones (with view size in IB equal to 320x568) works perfectly for new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screens, and iPhone 6 plus even loads @3x assets if I provide those. The first question, do I really have to add launch storyboard to indicate that my app supports new iPhones, or I can go without it? If I add them all my xibs designed for iPhone 4s / 5 will stop working for iPhone 6 and 6 plus. The second question, do I really have to provide @3x assets set? iPhone 6 uses @2x assets set, iPhone 6 plus in case of the absence of @3x images upscales @2x images in a very smooth way so that I cannot determine any pixellation. I'm interested, in particular, whether Apple will reject the app, or maybe not add some kind of "Optimized for iPhone 6 Plus" badge to the app, or any other penalties?

@CONTENT:I am building my Keyboard Extension app and i have added key pop animation on button when user tap on it. It works fine for inside image but for top row image pop up area become hidden as it clip the subview. I tried with ClipToBound property and set as False. But still not working. Anyone have any idea how to fix this? adding subview on superview also not works. Image A is showing correct pop up as it is inside frame of keyboard. Image B is wrong as pop up clip inside frame.

@TITLE:iOS 8 Orientation change: Keyboard frame does not display correctly
@CONTENT:This is only an iOS 8 problem, the keyboard displays correctly in iOS 7 with device orientation change. My application supports both portrait and landscape orientation and uses autolayout. If I push a UIViewController subclass that contains a UITextField subclass onto a navigation stack and the UITextField becomes the first responder in portrait orientation then the default keyboard displays correctly. However, if I rotate the device to landscape orientation then the UIViewController subview layouts are displayed correctly but the keyboard is displayed in the top center of the screen. The keyboard's orientation is correct for landscape orientation but it's frame width is the same width as expected for portrait orientation. If I set the app orientation to only landscape orientation then the keyboard does not display correctly. This is only a problem for iOS 8 orientation change.

@TITLE:Generic in subscript for swift
@CONTENT:I understand that with Swift you can specify a function-specific generic with this form: func someFunction<T>(type: T.Type) {...}
 However, is it possible to do something similar with subscripts? Where you can specify a type within the brackets like so: subscript<T>(type: T.Type) -> T {...}
 EDIT: Updated solution based upon the accepted answer subscript(type: AnyClass.Type) -> Any {
    return sizeof(type)
}
 EDIT 2: Upon testing, It seems that I cannot actually use this subscript. I get "CLASS is not identical to AnyClass.Type" so I am back to square one

@TITLE:Why is using the move constructor in a return statement legal?
@CONTENT:Consider the following: #include <iostream>

#define trace(name) std::cout << #name << " (" << this << "), i = " << i << std::endl

class C
{
    C(C const&);
    C& operator=(C const&);
public:
    int i;
    C() : i(42) { trace(CTOR); }
    C(C&& other) : i(other.i) { trace(MOVE); other.i = 0; }
    C& operator=(C&& other) { trace(ASGN); other.i = 0; return *this; }
    ~C() { trace(DTOR); }
};

C
func1(bool c)
{
    C local;
    if (c)
        return local;
    else
        return C();
}

int
main()
{
    C local(func1(true));
    return 0;
}
 Both MSC and g++ allow the return local, and use the move constructor (as shown by the output) when doing so. While this makes a lot of sense to me, and I think it probably should be the case, I can't find the text in the standard that authorizes it. As far as I can see, the argument to the move constructor must be either a prvalue (which it clearly isn't) or an xvalue; it is in fact an lvalue, which would make the return just as illegal as C other = local; in the function body (which does fail to compile).
@CODE:#include <iostream>

#define trace(name) std::cout << #name << " (" << this << "), i = " << i << std::endl

class C

    C(C const&);

@TITLE:Easily finding and replacing every match in a nested list
@CONTENT:Take this object as an example: expr <- substitute(mean(exp(sqrt(.)), .))
 It is a nested list. I want to find every element that matches quote(.). For example, magrittr's solution matches only the first level of the call: dots <- c(FALSE, vapply(expr[-1], identical, quote(.),

dots
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE
 But I wanted to find every "." in an arbitrary nested list. In this particular case this would be these two dots: expr[[3]]
expr[[2]][[2]][[2]]
 And then these dots should be replaced: expr[[3]] <- as.name("replacement")
expr[[2]][[2]][[2]] <- as.name("replacement")
expr
# mean(exp(sqrt(replacement)), replacement)

@TITLE:Getting Gradle error ：Could not reserve enough space for object heap； constantly in Intellij IDEA
@CONTENT:So I have a problem with memory allocation. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I've read this thread and tried the advice there multiple times. Sometimes -Xms512m -Xmx768m works, sometimes -Xms256m -Xmx512m. I'm sick and tired of having to tweak this setting in IntelliJ under the Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle VM options setting. Is there no setting that solves this once and for all? I have 16GB of RAM on my Windows 7 computer, I'm running IntelliJ IDEA EAP 14 build 138.2210.3, 64 bit version. Android Gradle build plugin v0.12. I'm suspecting gradle is not running in 64 bit mode, or else it would have ~7 GB of free memory to eat from. Why is it not utilizing this? EDIT: I got the same error in Visual Studio 2015 with cordova 5.1.1 under Windows 10. See my solution below.

@TITLE:creating a boolean array which compares numpy elements to None
@CONTENT:I have a numpy array with dtype=object, and I want to create a boolean array identifying which elements are None. But it looks like None behaves differently... a = np.array(['Duck','Duck','Duck','Goose',None,1,2,3,1,3,None,4])

print a == 3
print a == None
 which results in [ True  True  True False False False False False False False False False]
[False False False False False False False  True False  True False False]
False
 Is there an "numpythonic" way to get a boolean array of the None elements? I can use np.array([x is None for x in a])
 but this seems like there should be a better way.

@LINK:/questions/26024912/shimming-dependencies-of-dependencies-with-browserify-shim
@TITLE:Shimming dependencies of dependencies with browserify-shim
@CONTENT:I'm trying to refactor a library that uses Browserify by shimming certain modules out of the bundle using browserify-shim. Specifically, the library uses require("codemirror") but I want to provide a bundle that doesn't include CodeMirror but will rather use one that is provided via CDN. So I've got browserify-shim config in my package.json like   "browserify-shim": {
    "jquery": "global:jQuery",
    "codemirror": "global:CodeMirror"
  }
 So far so good. require('jquery') and require('codemirror') have disappeared from the browserified bundle and been replaced by the expected code snippet to grab jQuery and CodeMirror off of the window object. The library also requires some CodeMirror add-ons. For example require('codemirror/addon/hint/show-hint.js'). That's fine. I want that add-on bundled. However, within this add-on is a UMD wrapper that includes require("../../lib/codemirror"). Browserify is seeing this and is bundling the CodeMirror from /node_modules/codemirror/lib/codemirror.js because of this (I think). I want this to use window.CodeMirror as defined in the codemirror shim instead, but cannot figure it out. Have tried many variations including the following:   "browserify-shim": {
    "jquery": "global:jQuery",
    "codemirror": "global:CodeMirror",
    "../../lib/codemirror": "global:CodeMirror",
    "codemirror/addon/hint/show-hint.js": { 
      "exports":null,
      "depends":["../../lib/codemirror:CodeMirror"]
    }
  }
 That require("../../lib/codemirror") will not go away! I'm sure I'm missing something. I'm running this from a Gulp script, but I don't think that should make any difference. Browserify version 3.38.1. Browserify-shim version 3.7.0. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: How do I do an UPSERT (MERGE, INSERT K ON DUPLICATE UPDATE) in PostgreSQL? 2 answers I am trying to write a bulk upsert in python using the SQLAlchemy module (not in SQL!). I am getting the following error on a SQLAlchemy add: sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (IntegrityError) duplicate key value violates unique constraint "posts_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(TEST1234) already exists.
 I have a table called posts with a primary key on the id column. In this example, I already have a row in the db with id=TEST1234. When I attempt to db.session.add() a new posts object with the id set to TEST1234, I get the error above. I was under the impression that if the primary key already exists, the record would get updated. How can I upsert with Flask-SQLAlchemy based on primary key alone? Is there a simple solution? If there is not, I can always check for and delete any record with a matching id, and then insert the new record, but that seems expensive for my situation, where I do not expect many updates.

@CONTENT:So I've been trying to implement Leaderboards/Achievements in my game, and without any kind of implementation, the game runs just fine. I've successfully imported the google-play-services-lib and copied over BaseGameUtils. But whenever I try to call setup for a GameHelper object, it crashes it. LogCat gives the following error: getCSCPackageItemText() You have not specified a View to use as content view for popups.

A bit below that, this error is also given:  java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.packagename.AndroidLauncher}: android.util.AndroidRuntimeException: requestFeature() must be called before adding content
 Yet all the tutorials I've seen on integrating GPGS with libGDX never use either of those functions. I've tried implementing setViewForPopups on my main view(I'm using Mopub for ads, so I put two views into a layout), but it doesn't seem to change anything. Here's the section of my onCreate method that seems to cause the crash:    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

   GameHelperListener gameHelperListener = new GameHelper.GameHelperListener() {

 I've searched everywhere and no one else seemed to have this problem specifically. Any advice? I'm using the newest versions of google-play-services-lib and BaseGameUtils.

@TITLE:Memory Usage Climbing Up in PhoneGap App
@CONTENT:I have a PhoneGap / JQuery MObile App which fetches data from server thru Ajax and displays it as a list. With each Ajax fetch the Memory occupied by App increases by about 10 MB. For the first fetch it might be OK as it fetches a large number of records (around 700). However, for subsequent calls my understanding is that it should reuse the memory instead of piling up another 10 MB each time. I have used .off() to release event handlers in case they were holding the memory but no success. Here is the main page Div where the output is displayed: <div data-role="content"  class="MainContent"  style="overflow:hidden; padding-top: 0px;">
    <ul data-divider-theme="b" data-role="listview" data-inset="true" class="MainMenu">

    </ul>
 And this is the Javascript code that fetches the data from server and displays in the above div. AjaxFile = "mydomai.com/ajax.php";
$.get(AjaxFile, function (AjaxData) {

        });
    });

});

@TITLE:Optional type '$T11' cannot be used as a boolean; test for '!= nil' instead since installing XCode 6 beta 7
@CONTENT:Here is the code where I'm getting the error: for (key, value) in info {
    let fieldValue: AnyObject? = value

    if (!fieldValue || fieldValue?.length == 0) { // this line gives the error
        informationComplete = false;
    } 
}
 This is what XCode suggests I use which causes another error: for (key, value) in info {
    let fieldValue: AnyObject? = value

    if ((!fieldValue || fieldValue?.length == 0) != nil) { //bool not convertible to string
        informationComplete = false;
    }
 }
 Help is appreciated. Thanks for your time

 I have a large dataframe with a date variable that has multiple formats for dates. Most of the formats in the variable are shown above- there are a couple of very rare others too. The reason why there are multiple formats is that the data were pulled together from various websites that each used different formats. I have tried using straightforward conversions e.g. strftime(mydf$date,"%d/%m/%Y")
 but these sorts of conversion will not work if there are multiple formats. I don't want to resort to multiple gsub type editing. I was wondering if I am missing a more simple solution? Code for example:     structure(list(date = structure(c(12L, 8L, 18L, 6L, 7L, 4L, 14L, 
10L, 1L, 5L, 3L, 17L, 16L, 11L, 15L, 13L, 9L, 2L), .Label = c("13-11-1961", 
"13-Sep-97", "15-Sep-70", "16-Oct-63", "18 August 1987", "18 August 1992", 
"19 September 1995", "20 August 1974", "22 August 1989", "22 Jan 2008", 
"03/23/87", "25 February 1987", "26-10-1993", "30-Sep-65", "30 August 1988", 
"5 December 1984", "5 October 1994", "9 October 1984"), class = "factor")), .Names = "date", row.names = c(NA, 
-18L), class = "data.frame")

But no matter which linux distro docker run on, docker can run these different linux distribution jsut like in a virtual machine. I know docker use aufs to control diffrent read-write access level. So it can reuse some file on host machine. But how can docker run a apt-get command in a container when I run docker in a arch linux ? Is the imagegs contain the apt-get binary? But different linux distribution has different libs and software version. Even the configuration file are differnt.How docker can "run" a ubuntu in a arch linux?

@TITLE:directory structure for a project that mixes C++ and Python
@CONTENT:Say you want want to create a programming project that mixes C++ and Python. The Foo C++ project structure uses CMake, and a Python module is created by using Swig. The tree structure would look something like this: uww CMakeLists.txt
uww FooConfig.cmake.in
uww FooConfigVersion.cmake.in
uww Makefile
uww README
uww foo
x?? uww CMakeLists.txt
x?? uww config.hpp.in
x?? uww foo.cpp
x?? |ww foo.hpp
|ww swig
    |ww foo.i
 Now you would like to make use of the Foo project within a Python project, say Bar: uww AUTHORS.rst
uww CONTRIBUTING.rst
uww HISTORY.rst
uww LICENSE
uww MANIFEST.in
uww Makefile
uww README.rst
uww docs
x?? uww Makefile
x?? uww authors.rst
x?? uww conf.py
x?? uww contributing.rst
x?? uww history.rst
x?? uww index.rst
x?? uww installation.rst
x?? uww make.bat
x?? uww readme.rst
x?? |ww usage.rst
uww bar
x?? uww __init__.py
x?? |ww bar.py
uww requirements.txt
uww setup.cfg
uww setup.py
uww tests
x?? uww __init__.py
x?? |ww test_bar.py
|ww tox.ini
 This structure was crated by using cookiecutter's pypackage template. A BoilerplatePP template is also available to generate a CMake C++ project using cookiecutter (no Swig part). So now that I have the structure of both projects, and considering that the development will take place mainly in Python and the the project will be run in different systems, I need to address the following questions: What's the best way to mix them? Should I collapse both root directories? Should I have the Foo C++ project as a directory of the Bar project or the other way around? I may be inclined to put the entire C++ structure shown above in a folder at the root level of the Python project, but I would like to know a priori any pitfalls as the CMake system is quite powerful and it may be convenient to do it the other way around. In case I decide to put the Foo project as a directory within Bar, is the Python setuptools package as powerful as the CMake build system? I ask this because when I take a look at the Bar project, at the top level it seems there's only a bunch of scripts, but I don't know if this is the equivalent to CMake as I'm new to Python. The Bar project outlined above has a single bar directory, but I assume that whenever this project expands, instead of having many other directories at the root level, other directories containing Python code will be placed within bar. Is this correct (in the Pythonic sense)? I assume that a single egg will be produced from the entire project, so that it can be installed and run in many different python systems. Is the integration of the module created by the Foo project easy? I assume that this module will be created in a different directory than bar. In order for the Python code within the bar directory, the module created by Swig has to be available, so I guess the most straightforward way to do this is to modify the environmental variable PYTHONPATH using the CMake system. Is this fine or is there a better way?

@CONTENT:I was looking at the following example from http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/ and I couldn't figure out how the 2nd for loop worked. How can the for loop know when the array ends. If it can figure this out why does the first loop not use a similar approach? It was my impression that the length of an array could not be determined. I'm not sure how to reconcile these notions. Thanks! Edit: Thanks for all the great answers! #include <iostream>

@LINK:/questions/25217065/scikit-learn-clustering-text-documents-using-dbscan
@TITLE:scikit-learn: clustering text documents using DBSCAN
@CONTENT:I'm tryin to use scikit-learn to cluster text documents. On the whole, I find my way around, but I have my problems with specific issues. Most of the examples I found illustrate clustering using scikit-learn with k-means as clustering algorithm. Adopting these example with k-means to my setting works in principle. However, k-means is not suitable since I don't know the number of clusters. From what I read so far -- please correct me here if needed -- DBSCAN or MeanShift seem the be more appropriate in my case. The scikit-learn website provides examples for each cluster algorithm. The problem is now, that with both DBSCAN and MeanShift I get errors I cannot comprehend, let alone solve. My minimal code is as follows: docs = []
for item in [database]:
    docs.append(doc)

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=1)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(docs)

db = DBSCAN(eps=0.3, min_samples=10).fit(X)

 (My documents are already processed, i.e., stopwords have been removed and an Porter Stemmer has been applied.) When I run this code, I get the following error when instatiating DBSCAN and calling fit(): ...
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/cluster/dbscan_.py", line 248, in fit

n = X.shape[0]
IndexError: tuple index out of range
 Clicking on the line in dbscan_.py that throws the error, I noticed the following line ...
X = np.asarray(X)
n = X.shape[0]
...
 When I use these to lines directly in my code for testing, I get the same error. I don't really know what np.asarray(X) is doing here, but after the command X.shape = (). Hence X.shape[0] bombs -- before, X.shape[0] correctly refers to the number of documents. Out of curiosity, I removed X = np.asarray(X) from dbscan_.py. When I do this, something is computing heavily. But after some seconds, I get another error: ...

Am I correct in understanding that ASP.net Web API create a new controller instance (and satisfies its dependencies) for each incoming request?

@CONTENT:As we know we have two alternates for making our applicaiton location aware Either we use Google・s Location Services API (part of Google Play services) or we use Androids Location API . The problem I have here is that using the Google's services , we have to use interface com.google.android.gms.location.LocationListener that provides us with location updates. However unlike the android.location.LocationListener, the google's version doesnt' provides us the state of the location provider (gps or internet). we have the following methods in the Androids Location Listener abstract void   onLocationChanged(Location location)
Called when the location has changed.
abstract void   onProviderDisabled(String provider)
Called when the provider is disabled by the user.
abstract void   onProviderEnabled(String provider)
Called when the provider is enabled by the user.
abstract void   onStatusChanged(String provider, int status, Bundle extras)
Called when the provider status changes
 . However in google we have just one abstract void   onLocationChanged(Location location)
 How would I identify the changes in the provider if I am using the google services ? . For example in midst of the application usage , the user decides the shut off the GPS , I wanted to show a toast on this event. I am in the dark how should I acheive that .

@CONTENT:I'm doing a relationship with many to many with mongoDb and mongoose.js, i know that there is many options, my situation is this: I've two documents, user and projects, one user can have many projects and one project can have many user, so in my case i've 4 options: 1 - An array of id_user inside project document. 2 - An array of id_project inside user document. 3 - An array of id_user inside project document && An array of id_project inside user document. 4 - A third table mapping user and project relationship(like a relational database). The option 1 and 2 are unavailable, because, imagine in the scenario of the option 1 if i wanted to find all projects from the user, i will have to look for this user id inside every project document array of the users(traverse this array in every project), this definitely isn't a good approach. The option 3 is good but i will have to make some kind of transaction to ensure that both documents will be written, it's not that bad, because both documents will be much more read than written The option 4 is simpler because when i add one user to a project, it's just to add a new document with both id's(it's good solution i think, because i will don't need to care about transaction, it's a good solution?)

@TITLE:layoutManager boundingRectForGlyphRange:inTextContainer: does not work for all strings
@CONTENT:I have a UILabel with a tweet like string, including mentions of other users. Hey @stephen and @frank and @Jason1.
 I am attempting to have each mention be tappable so I can load that user's profile. I found some code from another SO post (How do I locate the CGRect for a substring of text in a UILabel?) that I was able to use in order to locate the position of each mention in the string. However it usually doesn't work for the last or last 2 mentions in a post. The method from the SO post (slightly modified): - (CGRect)boundingRectForCharacterRange:(NSRange)range
{
    NSMutableAttributedString *attributedString = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithAttributedString:self.myLabel.attributedText];
    NSTextStorage *textStorage = [[NSTextStorage alloc] initWithAttributedString:attributedString];
    NSLayoutManager *layoutManager = [[NSLayoutManager alloc] init];
    [textStorage addLayoutManager:layoutManager];
    NSTextContainer *textContainer = [[NSTextContainer alloc] initWithSize:self.myLabel.bounds.size];
    textContainer.lineFragmentPadding = 0;
    [layoutManager addTextContainer:textContainer];

    NSRange glyphRange;

    // Convert the range for glyphs.
    [layoutManager characterRangeForGlyphRange:range actualGlyphRange:&glyphRange];

    return [layoutManager boundingRectForGlyphRange:glyphRange inTextContainer:textContainer];
}
 Then, in touchesEnded:, I loop over each mention, get the range in the main string, and check if the touch is inside that CGRect. - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{        
    UITouch *touch = touches.allObjects[0];

    for (NSString *mention in self.mentions) {
        NSRange range = [self.postText rangeOfString:mention options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch];
        CGRect rect = [self boundingRectForCharacterRange:range];
        NSLog(@"rect for %@ is %@", mention, NSStringFromCGRect(rect));
    }
}

// Output from above
rect for @stephen is {{33.388, 0}, {72.471001, 20.553001}}
rect for @frank is {{143.021, 0}, {49.809998, 20.553001}}
rect for @Jason1 is {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}
 And this works great most of the time, however @Jason1 does not get matched. I've switched the order of the names and it's always the last one. My label does wrap, but it still sometimes matches names on the 2nd and 3rd lines. Is there a setting or something I'm missing? I've tried changing the size and font of the labels but no luck. I'm at a real loss here.

@LINK:/questions/24923101/computing-a-moving-maximum-in-bigquery
@TITLE:Computing a moving maximum in BigQuery
@CONTENT:Given a BigQuery table with some ordering, and some numbers, I'd like to compute a "moving maximum" of the numbers -- similar to a moving average, but for a maximum instead. From Trying to calculate EMA (exponential moving average) using BigQuery it seems like the best way to do this is by using LEAD() and then doing the aggregation myself. (Bigquery moving average suggests essentially a CROSS JOIN, but that seems like it would be quite slow, given the size of the data.) Ideally, I might be able to just return a single repeated field, rather than 20 individual fields, from the inner query, and then use normal aggregation over the repeated field, but I haven't figured out a way to do that, so I'm stuck with rolling my own aggregation. While this is easy enough for a sum or average, computing the max inline is pretty tricky, and I haven't figured out a good way to do it. (The examples below are of course somewhat contrived in order to use public datasets. They also do the rolling max over 3 elements, whereas I'd like to do it for around 20. I'm already generating the query programmatically, so making it short isn't a big issue.) One approach is to do the following: SELECT word,
  (CASE
    WHEN word_count >= word_count_1 AND word_count >= word_count_2 THEN word_count
    WHEN word_count_1 >= word_count AND word_count_1 >= word_count_2 THEN word_count_1
    ELSE word_count_2 END
    ) AS max_count
FROM (
  SELECT word, word_count,
    LEAD(word_count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY word) AS word_count_1,
    LEAD(word_count, 2) OVER (ORDER BY word) AS word_count_2,
  FROM [publicdata:samples.shakespeare]
  WHERE corpus = 'macbeth'
)
 This is O(n^2), but it at least works. I could also do a nested chain of IFs, like this: SELECT word,
  IF(word_count >= word_count_1,
    IF(word_count >= word_count_2, word_count, word_count_2),
    IF(word_count_1 >= word_count_2, word_count_1, word_count_2)) AS max_count
FROM ...
 This is O(n) to evaluate, but the query size is exponential in n, so I don't think it's a good option; certainly it would surpass the BigQuery query size limit for n=20. I could also do n nested queries: SELECT word,
  IF(word_count_2 >= max_count, word_count_2, max_count) AS max_count
FROM (
  SELECT word,
    IF(word_count_1 >= word_count, word_count_1, word_count) AS max_count
  FROM ...
)
 It seems like doing 20 nested queries might not be a great idea performance-wise, though. Is there a good way to do this kind of query? If not, am I correct that for n around 20, the first is the least bad?
@CODE:LEAD() CROSS JOIN SELECT word,
  (CASE
    WHEN word_count >= word_count_1 AND word_count >= word_count_2 THEN word_count

    ELSE word_count_2 END

@TITLE:Characters extracted by istream >> double
@CONTENT:Sample code at Coliru: #include <iostream>

int main()
{
    double d; std::string s;

    std::istringstream iss("234cdefipxngh");

 I'm reading off N3337 here (presumably that is the same as C++11). In [istream.formatted.arithmetic] we have (paraphrased): operator>>(double& val); As in the case of the inserters, these extractors depend on the locale・s num_get<> (22.4.2.1) object to perform parsing the input stream data. These extractors behave as formatted input functions (as described in 27.7.2.2.1). After a sentry object is constructed, the conversion occurs as if performed by the following code fragment: typedef num_get< charT,istreambuf_iterator<charT,traits> > numget; iostate err = iostate::goodbit; use_facet< numget >(loc).get(*this, 0, *this, err, val); setstate(err); Looking over to 22.4.2.1: The details of this operation occur in three stages X Stage 1: Determine a conversion specifier X Stage 2: Extract characters from in and determine a corresponding char value for the format expected by the conversion specification determined in stage 1. X Stage 3: Store results In the description of Stage 2, it's too long for me to paste the whole thing here. However it clearly says that all characters should be extracted before conversion is attempted; and further that exactly the following characters should be extracted: any of 0123456789abcdefxABCDEFX+- The locale's decimal_point() The locale's thousands_sep() Finally, the rules for Stage 3 include: X For a floating-point value, the function strtold. The numeric value to be stored can be one of: X zero, if the conversion function fails to convert the entire field. This all seems to clearly specify that the output of my code should be 0, 'ipxngh'. However, it actually outputs something else. Is this a compiler/library bug? Is there any provision that I'm overlooking for a locale to change the behaviour of Stage 2? (In another question someone posted an example of a system that does actually extract the characters, but also extracts ipxn which are not in the list specified in N3337). Update As pointed out by perreal, this text from Stage 2 is relevant: If discard is true, then if ・.・ has not yet been accumulated, then the position of the character is remembered, but the character is otherwise ignored. Otherwise, if ・.・ has already been accumulated, the character is discarded and Stage 2 terminates. If it is not discarded, then a check is made to determine if c is allowed as the next character of an input field of the conversion specifier returned by Stage 1. If so, it is accumulated. If the character is either discarded or accumulated then in is advanced by ++in and processing returns to the beginning of stage 2. So, Stage 2 can terminate if the character is in the list of allowed characters, but is not a valid character for %g. It doesn't say exactly, but presumably this refers to the definition of fscanf from C99 , which allows: a nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point character, then an optional exponent part as defined in 6.4.4.2; a 0x or 0X, then a nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point character, then an optional binary exponent part as defined in 6.4.4.2; INF or INFINITY, ignoring case NAN or NAN(n-char-sequence opt ), ignoring case in the NAN part, where: and also In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be accepted. So, actually the Coliru output is correct; and in fact the processing must attempt to validate the sequence of characters extracted so far as a valid input to %g, while extracting each character. Next question: is it permitted, as in the thread I linked to earlier, to accept i , n, p etc in Stage 2? These are valid characters for %g , however they are not in the list of atoms which Stage 2 is allowed to read (i.e. c == 0 for my latest quote, so the character is neither discarded nor accumulated).

@CONTENT:Consider this function that should return the file extension of a given Path. pub fn get_extension<'a>(path: &'a Path) -> Option<&'a str> {
    let path_str = path.as_str().unwrap();

    }
}
 The error message is as follows: `path_str` does not live long enough
 The error message is pretty clear and it's a shame I can't work it out on my own. I understand it in theory but there are still a couple of blurred things for me. I understand that the compiler wants to tell me that path_str does not live long enough to be valid as the return value with is marked with lifetime 'a. But this is where it stops for me: I understand that the reference to path (the input parameter) should life exactly as long as the reference to the str that is wrapped in the Option (the output parameter) since we return Some(path_str.as_slice().slice_from(start)) I assume that in practice that means that path_str needs to live as long as path. What I don't understand is why exactly does path_str not live long enough and how could I fix this? What makes it die to soon? UPDATE As pointed out in the comments and also on IRC removing the superflous as_slice() makes the code compile. Does anyone know why that is? It was also pointed out that there exists a method to get the extension directly. But yep, I'm actually more interested in learning the story behind the problem though.

@CONTENT:I am trying to find an efficient algorithm to find permutation of a multiset, given an index. Ex: given {1, 3, 3}. All permutations in an ascending lexicographic order are {133, 313, 331}. These elements are indexed as {0, 1, 2}. Given index=2, the result is 331. I found an algorithm to find permutation of a set given a lexicographic index. His algorithm is efficient: O(n^2).

I describe his python code here so that you can easily follow. from math import factorial, floor #// python library

@TITLE:WildFly -> Undertow -> maping subdomain to war file not working
@CONTENT:WildFly 8.1.0 Final Windows Server 2012 R2 I have two sub-domains pointing at this server, and I want requests to each sub-domain to trigger a different war file:- webapp.domain1.com -> WildFly Server -> myapp1.war
test.domain2.net -> WildFly Server -> myapp2.war
 My standalone.xml file is currently configured as follows based on advice received on the JBoss Developer site:- <subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:undertow:1.1">

  <server name="default-server">
    <http-listener name="default" socket-binding="http"/>

    <host name="default-host" default-web-module="myapp1.war" alias="webapp.domain1.com"/>

    <response-header name="x-powered-by-header" header-value="Undertow/1" header-name="X-Powered-By"/>
  </filters>
</subsystem>
 Pointing a browser at webapp.domain1.com or test.domain2.net results in the request being sent to the WildFly server as expected, but the same war file (myapp1.war) is triggered in both cases. Switching the 'name' values of the <host .../> elements as follows results in myapp2.war being called whichever URL is used:-     <host name="other-host" default-web-module="myapp1.war" alias="webapp.domain1.com"/>
    <host name="default-host" default-web-module="myapp2.war" alias="test.domain2.net"/>
 It looks like Undertow is only processing details of the "default-host" entry. Can anyone here help with this please? Failing that, does anyone know if (and how) WildFly can be used with Apache Web Server? Many thanks, Andrew

}
 But the text colour in the combo box remainds as the default (black) colour. The colour in the drop down is white. The border colour and styling all work correctly. Is the label on the combobox some sort of sub-control I need to style separately? Or am I missing something else? Thanks. Edit: Added screenshots for clarity Edit 2: It looks like this only occurs when the combobox is set to not be editable (which is the correct behaviour for my program, so doesn't really help me.) When the combobox is set to editable, it obeys styles correctly. I've tried adding QCombobox:!editable
{
    color:white;
}
 but it doesn't fix the problem.

@TITLE:jQuery trigger mousedown registered by addEventListener
@CONTENT:I want to simulate fake mousedown event by jQuery trigger() method, and I register mousedown event by native javascript method - addEventListener(). And I found it can't be triggered... elem.addEventListener('mousedown', function () {
    alert('addEventListener');
});
$(elem).on('mousedown', function () {
    alert('on');
});
$(elem).trigger('mousedown');
 Sample in jsFiddle I do some tests about it. Register mousedown event by jQuery on() Result: works Register click event by addEventListener() Result: works Is anything wrong here? Thanks. P.S. The reason why uses addEventListener() is that I want to write a library without jQuery.
@CODE:elem.addEventListener('mousedown', function () {
    alert('addEventListener');
});
$(elem).on('mousedown', function () {
    alert('on');
});
$(elem).trigger('mousedown'); trigger() dispatchEvent

@TITLE:How to Exclude Duplicate C Shared Libraries (.so) in a Multi-Project Android Build?
@CONTENT:I get a "duplicate files" conflict when building a parent project with two library modules, which make use of the same libc++_shared.so shared library. (NOTE: Please do not consider this a "duplicate question". I have read several related posts, which have helped me get this far. However, no posts have provided an answer that works in my case involving NDK artifacts.) The build was working correctly when I only had 1 such library module. The addition of the second library module is now creating the conflict. Consider the following project structure: 1 parent project, 2 "child" projects - but each project is located at the same directory level (i.e. Not nested hierarchically) ProjectA/   (Parent)
    LibraryModuleA1/
        build/exploded-aar/com.package.name/
            LibraryModuleB1/<version>/jni/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so
            LibraryModuleC1/<version>/jni/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so

    build.gradle    (bgPB)

ProjectC/
    LibraryModuleC1/  (Uses NDK)
        build/lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so
        build.gradle    (bgC1)
    build.gradle    (bgPC)
 Library Module A1 depends on both Library Modules B1 & C1. A1 -> B1 A1 -> C1 Projects B and C both have NDK-based code and build/test correctly. Both depend on the libc++_shared.so shared library. However, when building Project A, I get the following error during the :LibraryModuleA1:packageDebugTest task: Error: duplicate files during packaging of APK   /ProjectA/LibraryModuleA1/build/apk/LibraryModuleA1-debug-test-unaligned.apk

:LibraryModuleA1:packageDebugTest FAILED
 What I've Tried So Far I attempted to add the suggested closure to my build.gradle file, but which build.gradle file do I add it to? I have added the closure to bgA1, bgB1, and bgC1 (one at a time), with no success. The suggested closure says to use exclude 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'. Each "child" library module builds the libc++_shared.so file under the build/lib path. However, I noticed that the parent library module copies the libc++_shared.so file under jni/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so inside the build/exploded-aar directory structure. (See above) Should the closure instead read exclude 'jni/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so (i.e. jni vs. lib)? Since I am using Gradle plugin 0.9.1, I tried using pickFirst in place of exclude, but that wasn't successful either. Can someone help determine how I should configure the `packagingOptions' closure for my given case? Thank you for your help!

@TITLE:Converting an RPy2 ListVector to a Python dictionary
@CONTENT:The natural Python equivalent to a named list in R is a dict, but RPy2 gives you a ListVector object. import rpy2.robjects as robjects

a = robjects.r('list(foo="barbat", fizz=123)')
 At this point, a is a ListVector object. <ListVector - Python:0x108f92a28 / R:0x7febcba86ff0>

  foo: <class 'rpy2.robjects.vectors.StrVector'>

  <FloatVector - Python:0x10ac38fc8 / R:0x7febce0ae108>
[123.000000]
 What I'd like to have is something I can treat like a normal Python dictionary. My temporary hack-around is this: def as_dict(vector):
    """Convert an RPy2 ListVector to a Python dict"""
    result = {}
    for i, name in enumerate(vector.names):
        if isinstance(vector[i], robjects.ListVector):
            result[name] = as_dict(vector[i])
        elif len(vector[i]) == 1:
            result[name] = vector[i][0]
        else:
            result[name] = vector[i]
    return result

as_dict(a)
{'foo': 'barbat', 'fizz': 123.0}

b = robjects.r('list(foo=list(bar=1, bat=c("one","two")), fizz=c(123,345))')
as_dict(b)
{'fizz': <FloatVector - Python:0x108f7e950 / R:0x7febcba86b90>

 ...and I can see a styled preview when I open the fxml file in scenebuilder. But when I try to run the application I get an error: java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: ../stylesheet1.css So I tested it this way: <stylesheets>

Well, although my question wasn't answered why exactly it doesn't work the above way, I found a solution that works for me. In my FXML I have just the line <?scenebuilder-stylesheet ../stylesheet1.css?>
 so Scenebuilder works with that css. And in my main class I set the stylesheet programmatically: Scene scene = new Scene(root);

@TITLE:Why does not a template template parameter allow 'typename' after the parameter list
@CONTENT:Template template typename? When using template template syntax as in template <template <typename> class T>, it is required to use the keyword class, as using typename gives an error along the lines of: error: template template parameter requires 'class' after the parameter list Everywhere else the keywords typename and class are interchangeable in the basic case of declaring a template parameter. You could argue that the requirement when using template template is a hint that you are expected to pass a class type, but this is not always the case (especially not after C++11 introduced templated type aliases). template <template <typename> class T> // 'class' keyword required.
struct Foo {
    using type = T<int>;
};

template <typename T>
using type = T (*)();

using func_ptr_t = Foo<type>::type;

 The bean that retrieves images from the database based on a unique row identifier - BrandBean. @ManagedBean
@ApplicationScoped
public final class BrandBean
{
    @EJB
    private final BrandBeanLocal service=null;
    public BrandBean() {}

    public StreamedContent getImage() throws IOException {
        FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();

        if (context.getCurrentPhaseId() == PhaseId.RENDER_RESPONSE) {
            return new DefaultStreamedContent();
        }
        else {
            String id = context.getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().get("id");
            System.out.println("id = "+id);
            byte[] bytes = service.findImageById(Long.parseLong(id));
            return bytes==null? new DefaultStreamedContent(new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0])):new DefaultStreamedContent(new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes));
        }
    }
}
 When a row is updated (after it is edited) by clicking a tick located (indicated by <p:rowEditor>) in the last column of the data table, the getImage() method in the BrandBean is invoked as it should. This happens correctly in an application running on GlassFish server 4.0 using PrimeFaces 5.0 and JSF 2.2.6. A new image will be displayed in the data table immediately after a row is updated in the data table (and consequently in the database). There is another application running on Tomcat server 8.0.5 using Spring 4.0.0 GA in which the getImage() method is not invoked after a row held by the data table is updated resulting in still displaying the old image (not the newly updated one) in the data table (even though the changes are correctly propagated to the database). The newly updated image is displayed only when the page refreshed by pressing F5 (on most browsers). It is even not displayed on page load (entering a URL into the address bar and then pressing the enter key). In other words, when a row in a data table is updated by clicking the tick indicated by <p:rowEditor>, the getImage() method is not invoked (hence, the new image is not fetched from the database to be displayed on <p:graphicImage>). This method is invoked only when the page is refreshed/reloaded by pressing the F5 shortcut key. Why does this happen? How to show a newly updated image immediately after a row is updated? Superficially, this should neither be related to Spring nor JPA (the update operation is correctly propagated to the database after clicking the tick). This should rather be related to Tomcat server.

@TITLE:Emacs X calculating new window-start/end without redisplay
@CONTENT:Is it possible to calculate a new window-start/end without a redisplay occurring? If so, then an example would be greatly appreciated. If not, then what is the best way to approximate it? Example: ?We want to move to a new area of the buffer somewhere off screen, and place overlays when we get there. We might be using page-down or scroll-down or paragraph-down or end-of-buffer. When we get to that new point, we want to calculate the new window-start and the new window-end. However, we want to avoid a momentary naked looking buffer without any overlays. Ideally, the redisplay would occur once those overlays are added. I want to restrict new overlays to the new region based upon the new window-start/end. Point-Min: ?point = 1 Old Window Start: ?point = 1000 Old Window End: ?point = 1500 New Window Start: ?point = 3500 New Window End: point = 4000 Point-Max: ?point = 6000 Problem: When using the post-command-hook to try and calculate the new window-start and new window-end, the previous display positions are being used instead -- i.e., the old window-start and the old window-end. Here is a sample of the project I am working on. Absent fixing the window-start \ window-end problem, I get the following error: Error in post-command-hook (my-eol-ruler-function):
  (error "Invalid search bound (wrong side of point)")`.
 The error happens when going from (point-min) to the end of the buffer with the interactive function end-of-buffer. In the context of this error, (point-max) is beyond the old window-end. EDIT: ?Updated code to include a message: (message "point: %s | window-start: %s | window-end: %s | point-max: %s" (point) (window-start) (window-end) (point-max) ). The message is used to demonstrate that the new window-start and new window-end are not calculated within the post-command-hook because a redisplay has not yet occurred. However, I am trying to avoid a redisplay until after the new overlays have been placed -- otherwise, a naked buffer without overlays is visible for a split second. (defvar my-eol-ruler nil

@TITLE:How do you stop building an Option[Collection] upon reaching the first None?
@CONTENT:When building up a collection inside an Option, each attempt to make the next member of the collection might fail, making the collection as a whole a failure, too. Upon the first failure to make a member, I'd like to give up immediately and return None for the whole collection. What is an idiomatic way to do this in Scala? Here's one approach I've come up with: def findPartByName(name: String): Option[Part] = .?.?.

def allParts(names: Seq[String]): Option[Seq[Part]] =
  names.foldLeft(Some(Seq.empty): Option[Seq[Part]]) {
    (result, name) => result match {
      case Some(parts) =>
        findPartByName(name) flatMap { part => Some(parts :+ part) }
      case None => None
    }
  }
 In other words, if any call to findPartByName returns None, allParts returns None. Otherwise, allParts returns a Some containing a collection of Parts, all of which are guaranteed to be valid. An empty collection is OK. The above has the advantage that it stops calling findPartByName after the first failure. But the foldLeft still iterates once for each name, regardless. Here's a version that bails out as soon as findPartByName returns a None: def allParts2(names: Seq[String]): Option[Seq[Part]] = Some(
  for (name <- names) yield findPartByName(name) match {
    case Some(part) => part
    case None => return None
  }
)
 I currently find the second version more readable, but (a) what seems most readable is likely to change as I get more experience with Scala, (b) I get the impression that early return is frowned upon in Scala, and (c) neither one seems to make what's going on especially obvious to me. The combination of "all-or-nothing" and "give up on the first failure" seems like such a basic programming concept, I figure there must be a common Scala or functional idiom to express it.
@CODE:Option None def findPartByName(name: String): Option[Part] = .?.?.

def allParts(names: Seq[String]): Option[Seq[Part]] =
  names.foldLeft(Some(Seq.empty): Option[Seq[Part]]) {
    (result, name) => result match {
      case Some(parts) =>
        findPartByName(name) flatMap { part => Some(parts :+ part) }
      case None => None
    }
  } findPartByName None allParts None allParts Some Parts findPartByName foldLeft findPartByName None def allParts2(names: Seq[String]): Option[Seq[Part]] = Some(
  for (name <- names) yield findPartByName(name) match {
    case Some(part) => part
    case None => return None
  }
) return

@CONTENT:I have a class template which builds a simple array based on the template parameters as one of its members. I need to be able to initialize every element in the array to a single value in one of the constructors. Unfortunately this constructor must be constexpr.

  constexpr foo(T val)

 Using std::fill or a loop is incompatible with the constexpr requirement. Initializing with : data{val} only sets the first element of the array and zero-initializes the remainder. How can this be achieved? I feel like there should be a solution with variadic templates and tuples etc...

@CONTENT:We・re using JAX-WS in combination with JAXB to receive and parse XML web service calls. It・s all annotation-based, i.e. we never get hold of the JAXBContext in our code. I need to set a custom ValidationEventHandler on the unmarshaller, so that if the date format for a particular field is not accepted, we can catch the error and report something nice back in the response. We have a XMLJavaTypeAdapter on the field in question, which does the parsing and throws an exception. I can・t see how to set a ValidationEventHandler onto the unmarshaller using the annotation-based configuration that we have. Any ideas? Note: same question as this comment which is currently unanswered.

@TITLE:Can I move an SVG element between SVG groups, in d3.js
@CONTENT:Can I move an SVG element between SVG groups - without stirring too much calculation behind the scenes nor crafting too much code in my own code? The d3 api documentation mentions you cannot re-append removed elements (?). Recreating the element after removing it from its original group - may seem to be cumbersome in my code, and more expensive for d3 and the browser than it could be if that were possible. This is also relevant for defining an element before associating it with a group, not just for really moving it between groups (i.e. for moving an element from a non-group to a group).

@TITLE:Quoting in bash and perl in recursive ssh command
@CONTENT:I am writing a perl script to login in to a server with ssh and do some shell commands on the server. The problem is that the server is only accessible by first logging into another server. (I am using password-less login with ssh keys). The following bash script is working correctly, and illustrates the problem: #! /bin/bash
server1="login.uib.no"
server2="cipr-cluster01"
ssh "$server1" "ssh $server2 \"echo \\\"\\\$HOSTNAME\\\"\""
 It prints the correct host name to my screen: cipr-cluster01. However, when trying to do same thing in Perl: my $server1="login.uib.no";
my $server2="cipr-cluster01";

print qx/ssh "$server1" "ssh $server2 \"echo \\\"\\\$HOSTNAME\\\"\""/;
 I get the following output: login.uib.no. So I guess, there is some problems with the quoting for the perl script..
@CODE:#! /bin/bash
server1="login.uib.no"
server2="cipr-cluster01"
ssh "$server1" "ssh $server2 \"echo \\\"\\\$HOSTNAME\\\"\"" cipr-cluster01 my $server1="login.uib.no";

 This gives: My question is how can I move the y-axis to be on the right side of the plot? I've seen several posts about it from the past but they seem rather hacky so I was wondering whether anyone knows of a new implementation that makes it easier.

@TITLE:Replace crossfilter data, restore dimensions and groups
@CONTENT:I'm using dc.js to render a nice bubble chart of a dataset. Underlying dc.js is crossfilter. I'd like to smoothly refresh my chart with new data from the server. This issue on Github makes it clear that it is possible to do this by: deleting all the data from the crossfilter adding in the new data calling dc.redrawAll(). I've got this working but in order to delete all the data, you first have to clear all the filters (because crossfilter.remove only removes the records matching the current filter). I'd like to 'remember' how my data was filtered before, so I can reconstruct the filter again once I've replaced all the data. I'm willing to get into the guts of the crossfilter code, but any pointers would be helpful. Additionally: if anyone knows a way of updating crossfilter data based on a unique key, that'd be gold dust!

@TITLE:How is this causing an endless loop?
@CONTENT:Some legacy code I'm stuck maintaining is stuck in an infinite loop (and thus I myself seem to be in one); I can't figure out why/how, though. Here's the app's entry point, where it instantiates the main form (frmCentral): CODE EXHIBIT A public static int Main(string [] args)
{
    try
    {
        AppDomain currentDomain = AppDomain.CurrentDomain;

        currentDomain.UnhandledException += new UnhandledExceptionEventHandler(GlobalExceptionHandler);

        string name = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name;
        MessageBox.Show(string.Format("Executing assembly is {0}", name)); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is seen
        IntPtr mutexHandle = CreateMutex(IntPtr.Zero, true, name);
        long error = GetLastError();
        MessageBox.Show(string.Format("Last error int was {0}", error.ToString())); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is also seen

        if (error == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS)
        {
            ReleaseMutex(mutexHandle);

            IntPtr hWnd = FindWindow("#NETCF_AGL_BASE_", null);
            if ((int) hWnd > 0)
            {
                SetForegroundWindow(hWnd);  
            }
            return 0;
        }

        MessageBox.Show("made it into Main method #4"); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is seen

        ReleaseMutex(mutexHandle);

        MessageBox.Show("made it into Main method #5"); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is seen

        DeviceInfo devIn = DeviceInfo.GetInstance();

        MessageBox.Show("made it into Main method #6"); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is seen

        Wifi.DisableWifi();

        MessageBox.Show("made it into Main method #7"); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is seen

        // Instantiate a new instance of Form1.
        frmCentral f1 = new frmCentral();
        f1.Height = devIn.GetScreenHeight();
        f1.Text = SSCS.GetFormTitle("SSCS HHS", "", "");

        MessageBox.Show("made it before Application.Run() in Main method"); // TODO: Remove after testing <= this one is NOT seen
        Application.Run(f1);

        devIn.Close();

        Application.Exit();
        return 0;
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        SSCS.ExceptionHandler(ex, "Main");
        return 0;
    }
} // Main() method
 frmCentral's constructor then calls a (what's the opposite of glorified?) singleton method named DBConnection.GetInstance(): CODE EXHIBIT B public frmCentral()
{
    try
    {
        //
        // Required for Windows Form Designer support
        //
        InitializeComponent();
        MessageBox.Show("made it past InitializeComponent() in frmCentral constructor"); // <= this displays
        devIn = DeviceInfo.GetInstance();
        MessageBox.Show("made it past DeviceInfo.GetInstance() in frmCentral constructor"); // <= this displays
        dbconn = DBConnection.GetInstance();
        MessageBox.Show("made it past DBConnection.GetInstance() in frmCentral constructor");
        WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;

        UpdateMenuItemSelectable = false;
        ResetConnectionFetchForm = false;

        AllowNewItems = true;

        listboxWork.Focus();
        MessageBox.Show("made it through frmCentral constructor"); // <= this one does NOT display
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        SSCS.ExceptionHandler(ex, "frmCentral()");
    }
} // frmCentral Constructor
 Here's that "glorified" sort-of/kind-of singleton method: CODE EXHIBIT C // Singleton pattern, or at least a derivation thereof
public static DBConnection GetInstance()
{
    MessageBox.Show("made it into DBConnection.GetInstance()");
    try
    {
        if (instance == null)
        {
            MessageBox.Show("made it into DBConnection.GetInstance(); instance was null");
            instance = new DBConnection();
        }
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        SSCS.ExceptionHandler(ex, "DBConnection.GetInstance");
    }
    return instance;
}
 That instantiates DBConnection and so its constructor is called: CODE EXHIBIT D private DBConnection()
{
    try
    {
        // Connection String
        string conStr = "Data Source = " + filename;
        string cmpStr = conStr + ".tmp";
        MessageBox.Show(string.Format("made it into DBConnection constructor. cmpStr == {0}", cmpStr)); // TODO: Comment out or remove
        if (File.Exists(filename+".tmp"))
            File.Delete(filename+".tmp");

        engine = new SqlCeEngine(conStr);
        MessageBox.Show(string.Format("SqlCeEngine created. conStr == {0}", conStr)); // TODO: Comment out or remove

        if (File.Exists(filename))
        {
            MessageBox.Show(string.Format("file {0} exists", filename)); // TODO: Comment out or remove
        }
        else
        {
            // Create the SQL Server CE database
            engine.CreateDatabase();
            MessageBox.Show("Made it past call to engine.CreateDatabase()"); // TODO: Comment out or remove
        }
        engine.Dispose();

        objCon = new SqlCeConnection(conStr);
        MessageBox.Show("Made it past call to new SqlCeConnection(conStr)"); // TODO: Comment out or remove

        objCon.Open();
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        SSCS.ExceptionHandler(ex, "DBConnection.DBConnection");
    }
}
 I see the *MessageBox.Show()*s from Code Exhibit A (unless otherwise noted), then the same for Code Exhibit B, then Code Exhibit C, then Code Exhibit D, then it goes back and forth between C and D "until the cows come home." I don't see why the DBConnection constructor and the DBConnection GetInstance() recursively call each other, though...is there a needle in the haystack I'm missing, or an elephant hidden in plain sight, or...??? UPDATE public static void ExceptionHandler(Exception ex, string location)
{
    try
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Exception: " + ex.Message + "\n\nLocation: " + location, GetFormTitle("SSCS: " + ex.GetType().FullName,"",""));
    }
    catch(Exception exc)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Exception Handler generated an exception!\n" + exc.Message + "\n\nCalling Location: " + location, GetFormTitle("SSCS: " + exc.GetType().FullName,"",""));
    }
}
 UPDATE 2 Here's more edifying obscurities: public static string GetFormTitle(string formName, string serialNo, string siteNo)
{

    string titleBar = formName == "" ? "SSCS HHS" : formName;

    if((serialNo == ""))
    {
        User person = new User();
        person.getUserFromTable();
        serialNo = person.getSerialNo();
    }

    if (frmCentral.HashSiteMapping.ContainsKey(siteNo))
    {
        siteNo = (string) frmCentral.HashSiteMapping[siteNo];
    }


    if (serialNo != "")
        titleBar += " - " + serialNo + (siteNo == "" ? "" : " Site #" + siteNo);

    return titleBar;
}
 UPDATE 3 The uncaught exception code I added: currentDomain.UnhandledException += new UnhandledExceptionEventHandler(GlobalExceptionHandler);

static void GlobalExceptionHandler(object sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs args)
{
    Exception e = (Exception)args.ExceptionObject;
    MessageBox.Show(string.Format("GlobalExceptionHandler caught {0}; Compact Framework Version == {1}", e.Message, Environment.Version.ToString()));
}
 I have not seen any evidence that this handler is ever reached, though (so far, anyway). UPDATE 4 Very interesting - after adding a MessageBox.Show (or two) to GetFormTitle: public static string GetFormTitle(string formName, string serialNo, string siteNo)
{
    MessageBox.Show(string.Format("GetFormTitle() reached. formName == {0}; serialNo == {1}; siteNo == {2}", formName, serialNo, siteNo)); // TODO: Remove after testing
    string titleBar = formName == "" ? "SSCS HHS" : formName;

    if((serialNo == ""))
    {
        User person = new User();
        person.getUserFromTable();
        serialNo = person.getSerialNo();
    }

    if (frmCentral.HashSiteMapping.ContainsKey(siteNo))
    {
        siteNo = (string) frmCentral.HashSiteMapping[siteNo];
    }


    if (serialNo != "")
        titleBar += " - " + serialNo + (siteNo == "" ? "" : " Site #" + siteNo);
    MessageBox.Show(string.Format("titleBar val about to be returned. Val is {0}", titleBar)); // TODO: Remove after testing
    return titleBar;
}
 ...these are the sequence of of MessageBox.Show()s that I see now: 0) Made it into DBConnection.GetInstance() 
1) Made it into DBConnection.GetInstance() instance was null
2) Made it to DBConnection constructor cmpStr == ....
3) Sqlceengine created. conStr == ...
4) File \My Documents\HHSDB.SDF exists
5) Made it past call to new SqlCeConnection(conStr)
6) GetFormTitle() reached. fromName == SSCS:
System.Data.SqlserverCe.SqlCeException; serial No ==; siteNo ==
 ...followed by a round of more tail-chasing, recursive messages until I warm-boot (I hate to contradict the Fab 4, but contrary to popular opinion, Happiness is decidedly NOT a warm boot!*) ...so right in the midst of a MessageBox message display, an exception is inserted! Wholly Pennsylvania Hip-Hop (Key Rap)! * Let's have no attempts at humor revolving around warm booty, now!
 That was a superlative show of remote desk debugging, LB2!

@TITLE:Need explanation of weird syntax
@CONTENT:i follow tutorial and find this code: self.imageView.frame = (CGRect){.origin = CGPointMake(0.0f, 0.0f), .size = image.size};
 Its pretty clear What it does, but I'm not understand syntax of this line of code. First time i see something like this: .size = image.size. In dot syntax i expect to see something in front of dot, like self.view, but what is meaning of .size? Second question is - why there is round brackets and after them curly brackets? I never seen structure like that (){}; before. My question may sound silly, but now I'm a bit confused, can someone provide explanation? Thank you.
@CODE:self.imageView.frame = (CGRect){.origin = CGPointMake(0.0f, 0.0f), .size = image.size}; .size = image.size self.view .size (){}; {} [] () self.imageView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, image.size.width, image.size.height);

 Why is user manager trying to access dbo.[ApplicationUser] (which doesn't exist) rather than dbo.[AspNetUsers]? UPDATE 1: I downgraded to Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework 1.0 and Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Core 1.0 and I now get a "Invalid object name 'dbo.IdentityUser'" error when UserManager.Find is called. UPDATE 2: I upgraded back to Identity 2.0 and just to see what would happen backed up and deleted the database and regenerated it with code first (enable-migrations, update-database). Instead of adding the default Identity tables of: AspNetRoles AspNetClaims AspNetUserLogins AspNetUserRoles AspNetUsers It added these tables: dbo.ApplicationUser dbo.IdentityRole dbo.IdentityUserClaim dbo.IdentityUserLogin dbo.IdentityUserRole Which would explain why it is looking for ApplicationUser. What is it about my configuration that is forcing those names instead of the standard Identity names? I probably could change my migration script to those names but then I would end up with non-standard table names which would only lead to confusion going forward. How do I configure things to get the default Identity table names?

@TITLE:Debugging jsp with spring-boot and IntelliJ
@CONTENT:I'm developing a web app (war packaging) using spring-boot, jsp and an embedded tomcat. The app runs fine and I can debug java files without any problems if I add a maven run configuration with the spring-boot:run goal. But when I try to add a breakpoint in one of my jsp files IntelliJ shows this error: 'Breakpoint doesn't belong to any class'. If I configure IntelliJ to use an external tomcat server then the jsp debugging works perfectly. Is there a way of debugging jsp using the spring-boot maven goal? Is this a problem with spring-boot or with maven run configurations in IntelliJ? I'd really like to be able to use the full spring boot capabilities from my dev environment. Thank you.

@LINK:/questions/23283772/is-printing-a-null-pointer-undefined-behavior
@TITLE:Is printing a null-pointer Undefined Behavior?
@CONTENT:When studying the sample code for this question I had assumed it was Undefined Behaviour which was preventing subsequent uses of std::cout from printing. But it turns out that attempting to print a null pointer caused std::ios_base::badbit and std::ios_base::failbit to be set in its stream state which was the real cause for its being non-operational. Because of this, I am now curious if it really is Undefined Behaviour to (attempt) to print a null-pointer. So here are my questions: Is it Undefined Behaviour to print a null-pointer? If so, what is it about the stream inserter that would cause this? I'm pretty certain the inserter is smart enough to not dereference a null-pointer. I would also like to know why the inserter sets its error mask when encountering a null-pointer in this context (specifically badbit). Why doesn't it treat it like the termination of a string literal? I don't have a Standard handy, and I only found one source thus far that unfortunately led to a dead link.

@TITLE:What makes lists unhashable?
@CONTENT:So lists are unhashable: >>> { [1,2]:3 }
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
 The following page gives an explanation: A list is a mutable type, and cannot be used as a key in a dictionary (it could change in-place making the key no longer locatable in the internal hash table of the dictionary). I understand why it is undesirable to use mutable objects as dictionary keys. However, Python raises the same exception even when I am simply trying to hash a list (independently of dictionary creation) >>> hash( [1,2] )
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
 Does Python do this as a guarantee that mutable types will never be used as dictionary keys? Or is there another reason that makes mutable objects impossible to hash, regardless of how I plan to use them?

@LINK:/questions/23116911/all-permutations-of-a-string-in-python-recursive
@TITLE:All Permutations of a String in Python (Recursive)
@CONTENT:I need a kick in the head on this one. I have the following recursive function defined: def perms(s):
  if(len(s)==1):
    return s

  res = ''
  for x in xrange(len(s)):

    res += s[x] + perms(s[0:x] + s[x+1:len(s)])

  return res + '\n'
 perms("abc") currently returns: abccb
bacca
cabba
 The desired result is abc
acd
bac
bca
cab
cba
 Where am I going wrong here? How can I think about this differently to come up with the solution? Note: I am aware of the itertools function. I am trying to understand how to implement permutations recursively for my own learning. That is why I would prefer someone to point out what is wrong with my code, and how to think differently to solve it. Thanks!

@TITLE:actionbar search will not close after search
@CONTENT:I have an actionbar with a search icon. When the search icon is clicked, it expands to a search bar in which the user can type in a search.

@CONTENT:I have tried everything suggested here: Status bar won't disappear to no avail. My iPhone version of my app has no status bar shown, but on my iPad, which runs the scaled up version of my iPhone version, there is a status bar that won't go away! If it makes a difference, my app uses the devices camera for a majority of the app. If you need more info/code, don't hesitate to ask! My app is iOS 7 only, and I use Xcode 5. Also, I would like the status bar gone in the whole app. Do not suggest UIViewControllerBasedStatusBar in the plist-- it does not work.

 Where findViewById(R.id.textarea); refers to a TextView with some text, but the above code generates only empty pdf. What can be the issue? is there any link that have working sample of generating pdf using Android native API?

@LINK:/questions/22936972/why-comparator-comparing-doesnt-work-with-stringtolowercase-method-reference
@TITLE:Why Comparator.comparing doesn't work with String::toLowerCase method reference?
@CONTENT:I am trying to sort an array of Strings by reverse order (ignoring case), without modifying it, and just printing it. So I am using Java8 stream. But I can't manage to do it. Here is my attempt : package experimentations.chapter02;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StringStream {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sortStrings();
    }

    public static void sortStrings(){
        String[] stringsArray = "The quick brown fox has a dirty ladder".split("\\s+");
        System.out.println(
                Arrays.stream(stringsArray)
                .sorted(Comparator.comparing(String::toLowerCase).reversed())
                .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
    }

}
 The problem here is that String::toLowerCase is not accepted in the static method Comparator.comparing. Meanwhile, I managed to sort the array, but modifying it: public static void sortStrings(){
        String[] stringsArray = "The quick brown fox has a dirty ladder".split("\\s+");
        System.out.println(
                Arrays.stream(stringsArray)
                .map(String::toLowerCase)
                .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())
                .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
}
 So, what is the simpliest workaround?
@CODE:package experimentations.chapter02;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StringStream {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sortStrings();
    }

    public static void sortStrings(){
        String[] stringsArray = "The quick brown fox has a dirty ladder".split("\\s+");
        System.out.println(
                Arrays.stream(stringsArray)
                .sorted(Comparator.comparing(String::toLowerCase).reversed())
                .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
    }

} String::toLowerCase Comparator.comparing public static void sortStrings(){
        String[] stringsArray = "The quick brown fox has a dirty ladder".split("\\s+");
        System.out.println(
                Arrays.stream(stringsArray)
                .map(String::toLowerCase)
                .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())
                .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
}

@LINK:/questions/22913499/google-login-server-side-flow-python-google-app-engine
@TITLE:Google+ login - Server side flow - Python - Google App Engine
@CONTENT:I am building an app on Google App Engine using Flask. I am implementing Google+ login from the server-side flow described in https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/server-side-flow. Before switching to App Engine, I had a very similar flow working. Perhaps I have introduced an error since then. Or maybe it is an issue with my implementation in App Engine. I believe the url redirected to by the Google login flow should have a GET argument set "gplus_id", however, I am not receiving this parameter. I have a login button created by: (function() {
  var po = document.createElement('script');
  po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;
  po.src = 'https://plus.google.com/js/client:plusone.js?onload=render';
  var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
  s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);
})();

function render() {
  gapi.signin.render('gplusBtn', {
    'callback': 'onSignInCallback',
    'clientid': '{{ CLIENT_ID }}',
    'cookiepolicy': 'single_host_origin',
    'requestvisibleactions': 'http://schemas.google.com/AddActivity',
    'scope': 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login',
    'accesstype': 'offline',
    'width': 'iconOnly'
  });
}
 In the javascript code for the page I have a function to initiate the flow: var helper = (function() {
  var authResult = undefined;

  return {
    onSignInCallback: function(authResult) {
      if (authResult['access_token']) {
        // The user is signed in
        this.authResult = authResult;
        helper.connectServer();
      } else if (authResult['error']) {
        // There was an error, which means the user is not signed in.
        // As an example, you can troubleshoot by writing to the console:
        console.log('GPlus: There was an error: ' + authResult['error']);
      }
      console.log('authResult', authResult);
    },
    connectServer: function() {
      $.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + '/connect?state={{ STATE }}',
        contentType: 'application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8',
        success: function(result) {
          // After we load the Google+ API, send login data.
          gapi.client.load('plus','v1',helper.otherLogin);
        },
        processData: false,
        data: this.authResult.code,
        error: function(e) {
          console.log("connectServer: error: ", e);
        }
      });
    }
  }
})();

/**
 * Calls the helper method that handles the authentication flow.
 *
 * @param {Object} authResult An Object which contains the access token and
 *   other authentication information.
 */
function onSignInCallback(authResult) {
  helper.onSignInCallback(authResult);
}
 This initiates the flow at "/connect" (See step 8. referenced in the above doc): @app.route('/connect', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def connect():
    # Ensure that this is no request forgery going on, and that the user
    # sending us this connect request is the user that was supposed to.
    if request.args.get('state', '') != session.get('state', ''):
        response = make_response(json.dumps('Invalid state parameter.'), 401)
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response

    # Normally the state would be a one-time use token, however in our
    # simple case, we want a user to be able to connect and disconnect
    # without reloading the page.  Thus, for demonstration, we don't
    # implement this best practice.
    session.pop('state')

    gplus_id = request.args.get('gplus_id')
    code = request.data

    try:
        # Upgrade the authorization code into a credentials object
        oauth_flow = client.flow_from_clientsecrets('client_secrets.json', scope='')
        oauth_flow.redirect_uri = 'postmessage'
        credentials = oauth_flow.step2_exchange(code)
    except client.FlowExchangeError:
        app.logger.debug("connect: Failed to upgrade the authorization code")
        response = make_response(
            json.dumps('Failed to upgrade the authorization code.'), 401)
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response

    # Check that the access token is valid.
    access_token = credentials.access_token
    url = ('https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=%s'
           % access_token)
    h = httplib2.Http()
    result = json.loads(h.request(url, 'GET')[1])
    # If there was an error in the access token info, abort.
    if result.get('error') is not None:
        response = make_response(json.dumps(result.get('error')), 500)
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response
    # Verify that the access token is used for the intended user.
    if result['user_id'] != gplus_id:
        response = make_response(
            json.dumps("Token's user ID doesn't match given user ID."), 401)
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response
    ...
 However, the flow stops at if result['user_id'] != gplus_id:, saying "Token's user ID doesn't match given user ID.". result['user_id'] is a valid users ID, but gplus_id is None. The line gplus_id = request.args.get('gplus_id') is expecting the GET args to contain 'gplus_id', but they only contain 'state'. Is this a problem with my javascript connectServer function? Should I include 'gplus_id' there? Surely I don't know it at that point. Or something else?

@TITLE:HTML5 audio starts from the wrong position in Firefox
@CONTENT:I'm trying to play an mp3 file and I want to jump to specific location in the file. In Chrome 33 on Windows, the file jumps the correct position (as compared with VLC playing the mp3 locally) but in Firefox 28 on Windows it plays too far forward and in Internet Explorer 11 it plays too far behind. It used to work correctly in Firefox 27 and earlier. Is there a better way of doing this? EDIT: The problem doesn't even require SoundManager2. You can replicate the same issue with just the <audio> tag in Firefox. These two lines are all the code you need to reproduce it: <audio autoplay id="audio" src="http://ivdemo.chaseits.co.uk/enron/20050204-4026(7550490)a.mp3" controls preload></audio>
<button onclick="javascript:document.getElementById('audio').currentTime = 10;">Jump to 10 secs "...be with us in, er, 1 minute...  ok" </button>
 Try it here: http://jsfiddle.net/cpickard/29Gt3/ EDIT: Tried with Firefox Nightly, no improvement. I have reported it as bug 994561 in bugzilla. Still looking for a workaround for now.

@TITLE:git pre-commit hook code formatting with partial commit?
@CONTENT:is there a way to have a pre-commit hook which auto-formats the code (for example with astyle) but does not destroy a partial commit? Workflow: # edit a file.txt
git add -p file.txt
# add one chunk, but not another

git commit -m 'a message'
[PRE_COMMIT_HOOK] Formatting source code

git status
# the "another" chunk is still not added
 My problem is, that if you do a git add inside the pre-commit hook, which is required after the script formatted the source code, adds the "another" chunk, too. But I don't want that. Is there a way to achieve this?

@TITLE:Use a method on multiple sheets simultaneously without using ActiveSheet or Select
@CONTENT:The problem I'm having is fairly simple to describe. It has been drilled into my head (through lots of reading on SO and other Excel VBA forums/resources) that in general, in order to avoid bugs and provide a good user experience, it is best to avoid using .Select, .Activate, ActiveSheet,ActiveCell, etc etc when writing VBA code. Keeping this in mind: is there a way to use the .ExportAsFixedFormat method on a subset of Sheets in a workbook without employing one of the above? So far the only ways I have been able to come up with to do this are to either: use a For Each; however, this results in separate PDF files, which is no good. use the code similar to that generated by the macro recorder, which uses .Select and ActiveSheet: Sheets(Array("Sheet1", "Chart1", "Sheet2", "Chart2")).Select
ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:= _
    "exported file.pdf", Quality:=xlQualityStandard, _
    IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, openafterpublish:= True
 Any ideas? Perhaps it is impossible not to use ActiveSheet, but can I at least get around using .Select somehow? EDIT: To save anyone the trouble of tinkering, I have already tried this: Sheets(Array("Sheet1", "Chart1", "Sheet2","Chart2")).ExportAsFixedFormatType:= _
    xlTypePDF, Filename:= "exported file.pdf", Quality:=xlQualityStandard, _
    IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, openafterpublish:= _
    True

    imageView.setId(imgViewId);
    imageView.setClickable(true);
    imageView.setOnClickListener(this);
    ((ViewPager) container).addView(imageView, 0);

    // Set default Image before loading real image

    // Load real image with Picasso and show error image if failed
    Picasso.with(context).load(GalImgUrls[position]).error(R.drawable.no_img).into(imageView);

    return imageView;

 However, it does not show the "loading..." image. Any solutions/ideas? Thanks!
@CODE:@Override

    ImageView imageView = new ImageView(context);
    int padding = context.getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.padding_medium);
    imageView.setPadding(padding, padding, padding, padding);
    imageView.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);

    // Set default Image before loading real image
    imageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.img_def);

    imageView.setId(imgViewId);
    imageView.setClickable(true);
    imageView.setOnClickListener(this);
    ((ViewPager) container).addView(imageView, 0);

    // Set default Image before loading real image
    Picasso.with(context).load(R.drawable.img_def).into(imageView);

    // Load real image with Picasso and show error image if failed
    Picasso.with(context).load(GalImgUrls[position]).error(R.drawable.no_img).into(imageView);

    return imageView;

@TITLE:angularjs corousel stops working
@CONTENT:Im trying to make a carousel with ui-bootstrap for angularjs, i basically copied/pasted directly from the angular docs, and it works BUT it stops working at the last slide. It does not come back to the beggining, and the controls stop working, im not getting any errors on the console, it simply stops working <carousel interval="myInterval">
      <slide ng-repeat="slide in carousel" active="slide.active">

        <img class="img-responsive" ng-src="app/assets/img/articles/{{slide.img}}" style="margin:auto;">

      </slide>
    </carousel>
 EDIT: I have checked again And it does not stops working at the Last Slide, actually it stops at the SECOND, no matter how many elements there are. EDIT: I made a test site just with the carousel and still is not working This is the whole code, it stops at slide 2 and the controls stop working <html >

@TITLE:Strange behavior with actions, local variables and garbage collection in MVVM light Messenger
@CONTENT:I am having a really strange problem with the Messenger system in MVVM Light. It's hard to explain, so here is small program that demonstrates the issue: using System;
using GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Messaging;

namespace TestApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var prog = new Program();
            var recipient = new object();

            prog.RegisterMessageA(recipient);
            prog.RegisterMessageB(recipient);

            prog.SendMessage("First Message");
            GC.Collect();
            prog.SendMessage("Second Message");
        }

        public void RegisterMessageA(object target)
        {
            Messenger.Default.Register(this, (Message msg) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine(msg.Name + " recieved by A");
                var x = target;
            });
        }

        public void RegisterMessageB(object target)
        {
            Messenger.Default.Register(this, (Message msg) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine(msg.Name + " received by B");
            });
        }

        public void SendMessage(string name)
        {
            Messenger.Default.Send(new Message { Name = name });
        }

        class Message
        {
            public string Name { get; set; }
        }
    }
}
 If you run the application, this is the console output: First Message recieved by A
First Message received by B
Second Message received by B
 As you can see, the second message is never received by recipient A. However, the only difference between B and A is one line: the statement var x = target;. If you remove this line, A receives the second message. Also, if you remove GC.Collect(); then A receives the second message. However, this only hides the issue, as in a real program the garbage collector will automatically run eventually. Why is this happening? I assume that somehow, if the recipient action refers to a variable from it's containing method scope, it ties the action's lifetime to that scope so that once out of the scope it can be garbage collected. I don't understand why this is at all. I also don't understand why actions that do not reference variables from the scope they are defined in do not have this problem. Can anyone explain what is going on here?

            GC.Collect();
            prog.SendMessage("Second Message");
        }

        public void RegisterMessageA(object target)
        {
            Messenger.Default.Register(this, (Message msg) =>
            {

Also I noticed that all example of FormUrlEncoded work fine when it is not asynchronous, i.e. I have a return type of some sort and no callback - sorry I'm a little lost Should I send an empty body? Am I required to send one and won't the @Field parameters suffice? Using Retrofit 1.5.0

@TITLE:Performance considerations for temporary data in Oracle
@CONTENT:I'm evaluating various options to run a bunch of high-performing queries against a single temporary data set in Oracle. In T-SQL, I'd probably use in-memory temporary tables, but Oracle doesn't have an exact equivalent of this feature. I'm currently seeing these options: 1. Global temporary tables CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE test_temp_t (
  n NUMBER(10), 
  s VARCHAR2(10)
) ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS; -- Other configurations are possible, too

DECLARE
  t test_t;
  n NUMBER(10);
BEGIN

  -- Replace this with the actual temporary data set generation
  INSERT INTO test_temp_t
  SELECT MOD(level, 10), '' || MOD(level, 12)
  FROM dual
  CONNECT BY level < 1000000;

  -- Replace this example query with more interesting statistics
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t.n)
  INTO n 
  FROM test_temp_t t;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(n);
END;

CREATE TYPE test_t AS TABLE OF test_o;

 3. Materialised views I'm ruling them out for this use-case, because the temporary data set in question is rather complex and the implications on updating the materialised view would be too significant. Real data considerations The above are examples of what I'm trying to do. The real data sets involve: The temp data is denormalised from around 15 joined tables. It is produced around 2-20x / seconds. The actual amount of rows per temp data set is around 10-200 (not as big as in the above example). Each user of the system has their own temp data set (1M users overall, 10k concurrent users). Once the data set is established, around 10-50 analytical queries should be run against it. These analyses must be run online, i.e. they cannot be deferred to a batch job. Questions From my intuition, the temp table query "should" be slower because it (probably) involves I/O and disk access, whereas the PL/SQL collection query is a mere in-memory solution. But in my trivial benchmark, this is not the case as the temp table query beats the PL/SQL collection query by factor 3x. Why is this the case? Is there some PL/SQL <-> SQL context switch happening? Do I have other options for fast (yet extensive) "in-memory" data analysis on a well-defined temporary data set? Are there any significant publicly available benchmarks comparing the various options?

@TITLE:PHP 5.5 short_open_tag=on Security Hole?
@CONTENT:I've upgraded to PHP5.5 and in the PHP.ini now short_open_tag=off and I recognized this because some files are now not running because <? instead of <?php. Now there are two solutions scouting for any php file and change the open tag to <?php or activate short_open_tag=on Is there any security problem with the second option?

@TITLE:How do I get the IP address from a http request using the requests library?
@CONTENT:I am making HTTP requests using the requests library in python, but I need the ip address from the server that responded the http request and I'm trying to avoid to make two calls (and possibly having a different ip address from the one that responded the request. Is that possible? Does any python http library allows me to do that? ps: I also need to make HTTPS requests and to use an authenticated proxy. Update 1: Example: import requests

proxies = {
  "http": "http://user:password@10.10.1.10:3128",
  "https": "http://user:password@10.10.1.10:1080",
}

response = requests.get("http://example.org", proxies=proxies)
response.ip # This doesn't exist, this is just an what I would like to do
 then, I would like to know to which IP address requests connected from a method or property in the response. In other libraries I was able to do that by finding the sock object and using the getpeername() method.
@CODE:import requests

proxies = {
  "http": "http://user:password@10.10.1.10:3128",
  "https": "http://user:password@10.10.1.10:1080",
}

response = requests.get("http://example.org", proxies=proxies)

      drvFile = fldr.createFile(_gac, meta, cont).await().getDriveFile();
    }

 2/ retrieve the file using query (it's title): ArrayList<DriveId> findAll(String title, String mime, DriveFolder fldr) {
  ArrayList<DriveId> dIDs = null;
  if (isConnected()) try {
    ArrayList<Filter> fltrs = new ArrayList<Filter>();

    Query qry = new Query.Builder().addFilter(Filters.and(fltrs)).build(); 
    MetadataBufferResult rslt = (fldr == null) ? Drive.DriveApi.query(_gac, qry).await() :

 3/ You get valid DriveId. Try to use it to gain resource ID to use in RESTful API, or elsewhere. String fileID = drvId.getResourceId();
 You get a null value. After a few moments (random, difficult to specify), if you repeat the query, you'll finally get your resource ID. I know why, it is probably a latency issue. I'm just soliciting a comment from the Google Support Team. Is there a way to gain control? Query latency status?

@TITLE:Are there any browsers that set the origin header to ：null； for privacy-sensitive contexts?
@CONTENT:The Origin spec indicates that the Origin header may be set to "null". This is typically done when the request is coming from a file on a user's computer rather than from a hosted web page. The spec also states that the Origin may be null if the request comes from a "privacy-sensitive" context. My questions: What is a "privacy-sensitive" context, and are there any browsers that exhibit this behavior? Here is the full phrasing from the Origin spec: Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request from a "privacy-sensitive" context, the user agent MUST send the value "null" in the Origin header field. NOTE: This document does not define the notion of a privacy-sensitive context. Applications that generate HTTP requests can designate contexts as privacy-sensitive to impose restrictions on how user agents generate Origin header fields.

@TITLE:JSR-353 How to add null values using javax.json.JsonObjectBuilder
@CONTENT:AS the javax.json docs suggest the way to create a JsonObject is using the provided builders like: JsonBuilderFactory factory = Json.createBuilderFactory(config);
 JsonObject value = factory.createObjectBuilder()
     .add("firstName", "John")
     .add("lastName", "Smith")
     .add("age", 25)
     .add("address", factory.createObjectBuilder()
         .add("streetAddress", "21 2nd Street")
         .add("city", "New York")
         .add("state", "NY")
         .add("postalCode", "10021"))
     .add("phoneNumber", factory.createArrayBuilder()
         .add(factory.createObjectBuilder()
             .add("type", "home")
             .add("number", "212 555-1234"))
         .add(factory.createObjectBuilder()
             .add("type", "fax")
             .add("number", "646 555-4567")))
     .build();
 This example adds values for the gives keys. In real life the values are probably derived from some (pojo) domain object like: JsonBuilderFactory factory = Json.createBuilderFactory(config);
 JsonObject value = factory.createObjectBuilder()
     .add("firstname", customer.getFirstame())
     .add("lastname", customer.getLastame())
     .add("age", customer.getAge())
     ....
 The JsonOBjectBuilder throw a NPE in case key or value is null. In case the customer has no registered age then above code will throw a NPE. So basically for every field I add I have to check if the value is null or not and add the actual value and otherwise do not add the field or add JsonValue.NULL for the key. This causes a lot of (undesired) boilerplate... In my case I ended up with custom JsonUtils class including various static methods like: public static void add(JsonObjectBuilder builder, String name, Long value) {
    if (value == null) {
        builder.add(name,  JsonValue.NULL);
    }
    else {
        builder.add(name, value);
    }
}

public static void add(JsonObjectBuilder builder, String name, String value) {
    if (value == null) {
        builder.add(name,  JsonValue.NULL);
    }
    else {
        builder.add(name, value);
    }
}
 and then calling: builder = Json.createObjectBuilder();
JsonUtils.add(builder, "id", customer.getId());
JsonUtils.add(builder, "name", customer.getName());
JsonUtils.add(builder, "gender", customer.getGender());
builder.build()
 But someway if feels not right. Why does the javax.json provide no easier way to add null values (without if else boilerplate) or am I missing something? My main point of critism against the JSR-353 api is that despite it looks like a really nice fluent api (see top example from apidoc) but in reality it is not.
@CODE:JsonBuilderFactory factory = Json.createBuilderFactory(config);
 JsonObject value = factory.createObjectBuilder()
     .add("firstName", "John")
     .add("lastName", "Smith")
     .add("age", 25)
     .add("address", factory.createObjectBuilder()
         .add("streetAddress", "21 2nd Street")
         .add("city", "New York")
         .add("state", "NY")
         .add("postalCode", "10021"))
     .add("phoneNumber", factory.createArrayBuilder()
         .add(factory.createObjectBuilder()
             .add("type", "home")
             .add("number", "212 555-1234"))
         .add(factory.createObjectBuilder()
             .add("type", "fax")
             .add("number", "646 555-4567")))
     .build(); JsonBuilderFactory factory = Json.createBuilderFactory(config);
 JsonObject value = factory.createObjectBuilder()
     .add("firstname", customer.getFirstame())
     .add("lastname", customer.getLastame())
     .add("age", customer.getAge())
     .... public static void add(JsonObjectBuilder builder, String name, Long value) {
    if (value == null) {
        builder.add(name,  JsonValue.NULL);
    }
    else {
        builder.add(name, value);
    }
}

public static void add(JsonObjectBuilder builder, String name, String value) {
    if (value == null) {
        builder.add(name,  JsonValue.NULL);
    }
    else {
        builder.add(name, value);
    }

@TITLE:Difficulties while connecting to remote device. Needs more than one try
@CONTENT:I working with a project where I need to connect my tablet (android 4.2.2) to Bluetooth-to-UART converter (RN42 by microchip). I am using BluetoothChat example to manage bluetooth connection, but its difficult to connect. Sometimes program fails at method mmSocket.connect(); - it throws IOException. Sometimes i need three or more tries to connect to my remote device. After connection is made, it is very stable. I tried to change UUID, tried to change rn42 module (i also tried to use HC-05 module). I tried secure and insecure rfcomm connection, still no luck. here is my code: In the MainActivity:   @Override
public void onButtonPressed(View view, Device device){
    switch (view.getId()){
    case R.id.buttonRedaguotiIrengini:
        // Edit button is pressed
        Intent i = new Intent(this, DeviceActivity.class);
        i.putExtra("device", device);
        i.putExtra("requestCode", REQUEST_EDIT_DEVICE);
        startActivityForResult(i, REQUEST_EDIT_DEVICE);
        break;
    case R.id.buttonPrisijungti:
        if (mBtService.getState()==BluetoothService.STATE_CONNECTED){
            mBtService.stop();
        } else {
            BluetoothDevice btDevice = mBluetoothAdapter.getRemoteDevice(device.getMac());
            mBtService.connect(btDevice, false);
        }
        break;
    }
}
 in the BluetoothService Class:    // Name for the SDP record when creating server socket
private static final String NAME_SECURE = "BluetoothChatSecure";
private static final String NAME_INSECURE = "BluetoothChatInsecure";

@TITLE:$injector:modulerr using angular-strap?
@CONTENT:I am trying to get going with angular-strap directives, but encountering a module initialization error with the simplest setup. I have double checked a zillion times but can't see exactly what I might be missing. Here is a plunker link: http://plnkr.co/edit/H1VrF63GeSQWLXHDVIW7 The error I get is: Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module mgcrea.ngStrap due to:

 I read this response, but it didn't answer my question as I am not using ngSanitize or routes. This is as simple as it gets. Thanks

@TITLE:Binding a UISwitch's state to a model with ReactiveCocoa
@CONTENT:I am trying to bind a UISwitch's on state to a boolean property in my model using ReactiveCocoa. I started with: RACChannelTo(self.switch, on, @NO) = RACChannelTo(self.model, toggle, @NO);
 This is how I've been binding other views to other parts of my model, unfortunately it didn't appear to do anything for the UISwitch. The model's state does not affect the switch, or vice versa. So I tried: RACChannelTo(self.model, toggle, @NO) = [self.switch rac_newOnChannel];
 This appears to work ok, but I have to manually set up the switch's state beforehand. So, right now I have: self.switch.on = self.model.toggle;
RACChannelTo(self.model, toggle, @NO) = [self.switch rac_newOnChannel];
 Again, this works, but it seems very inelegant compared to using ReactiveCocoa with other controls. Isn't there a better way to do this?
@CODE:RACChannelTo(self.switch, on, @NO) = RACChannelTo(self.model, toggle, @NO); RACChannelTo(self.model, toggle, @NO) = [self.switch rac_newOnChannel]; self.switch.on = self.model.toggle;

@TITLE:UINavigationItem Prompt Issue
@CONTENT:I'm having a problem with the prompt on a UINavigationItem that I just can't resolve... I have a master and a detail view controller. When I push from the master to the detail a prompt is shown on the detail view controller: However, when I pop back to the master view controller, the view isn't resized and the window shows through (the window has been coloured red): This only happens on iOS7, on iOS6 the view resizes as expected. I've tried a few things such as setting the prompt to nil in viewWillDisappear or viewDidDisappear but nothing seems to fix it. If I set the navigation bar in the navigation controller to translucent it does fix this - unfortunately that's not an option. I've created a very small example project here which demonstrates the issue: https://github.com/InsertWittyName/NavigationItemPrompt Thanks in advance for any help!

@CONTENT:Suppose I have a list of numbers: my_list = [3, 8, 4, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1]
 I now want to find the indices of the 2 greatest numbers in this list. So, I try: import heapq

index1 = my_list.index(max_vals[0])
index2 = my_list.index(max_vals[1])

print index2
 Here, both index1and index2 are 1. This is because max_vals has 8 for both values, and the my_list.index() just searches for the first instance of 8. How can I get the indices of the top 2 values in this case, such that index1 is 1 as before, but index2 is now 4, corresponding to the other 8 in the list? On a side note, it seems rather inefficient to find the maximum value in a list, and then subsequently find the index of that value. Is there not a way to achieve this in one sweep of the list? Thank you.

 The challenge that I am facing is that, I cannot get my web page to take the full width of the paper. This is how I can set the viewport size: page.viewportSize = { width: mybestfitwidth, height: mybestfitheight };
 The challenge here is that I cannot figure out what mybestfitwidth should be. I can tell the width of my pdf page in inches, but I can't figure out what number of pixels would that be, because that depends on the dpi settings. I don't know what dpi settings phantomjs would use or how to modify it. In conclusion, I just need my page to print nicely and take full width of my pdf page. Is there any way I can achieve this?

@TITLE:adapting a non-constexpr integral value to a non-type template parameter, and code bloat
@CONTENT:Consider a function object F taking a constexpr size_t argument I struct F
{
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr size_t operator()(size <I>) const { return I; }
};
 wrapped within a type size <I>, where (for brevity) template <size_t N>
using size = std::integral_constant <size_t, N>;
 Of course, we could pass I directly but I want to emphasize that it is constexpr by using it as a template argument. Function F is dummy here but in reality it could do a variety of useful stuff like retrieving information from the Ith element of a tuple. F is assumed to have the same return type regardless of I. I could be of any integral type but is assumed non-negative. Problem Given a constexpr size_t value I, we can call F by F()(size <I>());
 Now, what if we want to call F with a non-constepr size_t value i? Consider the following: constexpr size_t L = 10;
idx <F, L> f;
for (size_t i = 0; i < L; ++i)
    cout << f(i) << " ";
 (Why would I need this? To give some context, I am in fact trying to build a composite iterator into a container view that represents a sequence of "joined" (concatenated) heterogeneous containers. This would give the ability to say something like join(a, b) = c; where arrays join(a, b) and c are of equal length. However, i is iterator state so cannot be constexpr, yet sub-iterators are stored in a tuple and need to be accessed by a constexpr index. Individual value_type's are roughly consistent so that the joined view can take on their common_type type, but sub-containers and consequently sub-iterators are of different types.) Solution Here, I have come up with struct idx <F, L>, which adapts function F for this purpose, assuming the input argument is less than L. This actually compiles fine giving output 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
 and here is a live example. idx works by recursively decomposing input i into a binary representation and reconstructing a constexpr counterpart N: template <typename F, size_t L, size_t N = 0, bool = (N < L)>
struct idx
{
    template <size_t R = 1>
    inline constexpr decltype(F()(size <0>()))
    operator()(size_t I, size <R> = size <R>()) const
    {
        return I%2 ? idx <F, L, N+R>()(--I/2, size <2*R>()) :
               I   ? idx <F, L, N  >()(  I/2, size <2*R>()) :
               F()(size <N>());
    }
};
 where R represents a power of 2 at the current iteration. To avoid infinite template instantiation, a specialization is given for N >= L, returning F()(size <0>()) as a dummy value: template <typename F, size_t L, size_t N>
struct idx <F, L, N, false>
{
    template <size_t R>
    inline constexpr decltype(F()(size <0>()))
    operator()(size_t I, size <R>) const { return F()(size <0>()); }
};
 In fact, this method is a generalization of the more common idiom with a Boolean argument: bool b = true;
b ? f <true>() : f <false>();
 where f is a function taking a bool as a template argument. In this case it is evident that all two possible versions of f are instantiated. Question Although this works and its run-time complexity is presumably logarithmic in i, I am concerned with the compile-time implications, like: how many combinations of idx and its template operator() are instantiated for this to work at run time for any input i that is not known at compile time? (I understand "all possible" again, but how many?) is it really possible to inline operator()? is there any alternative strategy or variant that is "easier" to compile? should I forget about this idea as an instance of pure code bloat? Notes Here are the compile times (in seconds) and executable sizes (in KB) I have measured for different values of L:  L      Clang(s)    GCC(s)    Clang(KB)    GCC(KB)
 10       1.3       1.7          33         36
 20       2.1       3.0          48         65
 40       3.7       5.8          87        120
 80       7.0      11.2         160        222
160      13.9      23.4         306        430
320      28.1      47.8         578        850
640      56.5     103.0        1126       1753
 So, although it appears roughly linear in L, it is quite long and frustratingly large. Attempting to force operator() inline fails: probably ignored by Clang (executable even larger), while GCC reports recursive inlining. Running nm -C on the executable e.g. for L = 160, shows 511/1253 different versions of operator() (with Clang/GCC). These are all for N < L so it appears the terminating specialization N >= L does get inlined. PS. I would add tag code-bloat but the system won't let me.
@CODE:F constexpr size_t I struct F
{
    template <size_t I>
    constexpr size_t operator()(size <I>) const { return I; }

@TITLE:How to navigate in a list of links using webbrowser?
@CONTENT:I have a list of url and I need to navigate them. How can I make sure that every url will call the DocumentCompleted event ? I've already tried to create many threads and tried using a single thread too but the app is still not firing the event DocumentCompleted for each url. Is there a way to make a loop in a list of urls and make them call a DocumentCompleted until the thread calls the next url ?

@CONTENT:I have used GWT Super Dev Mode since 2.5 without any problems. Recently I upgraded Eclipse and GWT to 2.6 at the same time. Everything seems to work up to the point I make any changes to my code: Start web server - ok Start super dev mode codeserver - initial compile ok Open code server - ok Open page - ok Make code change Hit bookmark "Dev mode on" - compile ok Reload page - no changes!? I use "-bindAddress 192.168.5.151" in my run configs to be able to browse from different devices. If I remove -bindAddress everything works again. Why?

@TITLE:How can I style a JavaFX menu and its items in CSS?
@CONTENT:I've got a MenuBar that is setup as follows in FXML: <MenuBar VBox.vgrow="NEVER">
    <menus>
        <Menu mnemonicParsing="true" text="_File">
            <items>
                <MenuItem mnemonicParsing="true" text="_New Project"/>
                <MenuItem mnemonicParsing="true" text="_OpenK"/>
                <MenuItem mnemonicParsing="false" text="Quit"/>
            </items>
        </Menu>
    </menus>
</MenuBar>
 This produces a menu as follows: I've successfully styled the MenuBar and the Menu File with the following CSS: .menu-bar { /* The menu bar itself */ }
.menu { /* The File menu item */ }
.menu:showing { /* menu when it's being shown (activated) */ }
.menu .label { /* Styles the text on a menu item */ }
.menu:showing .label { /* Styles the text on a menu item when activated */ }
 However, I've been unable to style the menu that is displayed. I've tried treating it as a ContextMenu: .context-menu {
    -fx-background-color: red;
}
 Doesn't do anything (it's not a ContextMenu, so no big surprise here). I've tried styling menu-item and menu-button: .menu-button,
.menu-item {
    -fx-background-color: red;
}
 This changes the menu (File), but not the menu items or the menu that is displayed. I've tried selecting a substructure called .items but that doesn't seem to exist. Questions How do I select/style the menu (the container that is holding New Project, Open..., Quit)? How do I select/style each individual MenuItem in the menu? Clarification To help clarify which elements I'm looking to style, I've added this image which outlines the components I'm wishing to style:
@CODE:<MenuBar VBox.vgrow="NEVER">
    <menus>
        <Menu mnemonicParsing="true" text="_File">
            <items>
                <MenuItem mnemonicParsing="true" text="_New Project"/>
                <MenuItem mnemonicParsing="true" text="_OpenK"/>
                <MenuItem mnemonicParsing="false" text="Quit"/>
            </items>
        </Menu>
    </menus>
</MenuBar> MenuBar Menu .menu-bar { /* The menu bar itself */ }
.menu { /* The File menu item */ }
.menu:showing { /* menu when it's being shown (activated) */ }
.menu .label { /* Styles the text on a menu item */ }
.menu:showing .label { /* Styles the text on a menu item when activated */ } .context-menu {
    -fx-background-color: red;

@LINK:/questions/21888140/de-bruijn-algorithm-binary-digit-count-64bits-c-sharp
@TITLE:De Bruijn algorithm binary digit count 64bits C#
@CONTENT:Im using the "De Bruijn" Algorithm to discover the number of digits in binary that a big number (up to 64bits) has. For example: 1022 has 10 digits in binary. 130 has 8 digits in binary. I found that using a table lookup based on De Bruijn give me the power to calculate this x100 times faster than conventional ways (power, square, ...). According to this website, 2^6 has the table to calculate the 64 bits numbers. this would be the table exposed in c# static readonly int[] MultiplyDeBruijnBitPosition2 = new int[64]
{
  0,1,2,4,8,17,34,5,11,23,47,31,63,62,61,59,
  55,46,29,58,53,43,22,44,24,49,35,7,15,30,60,57,
  51,38,12,25,50,36,9,18,37,10,21,42,20,41,19,39,
  14,28,56,48,33,3,6,13,27,54,45,26,52,40,16,32
};
 (I dont know if i brought the table from that website correctly) Then, based on the R.. comment here. I should use this to use the table with the input uint64 number. public static int GetLog2_DeBruijn(ulong v)
{
return MultiplyDeBruijnBitPosition2[(ulong)(v * 0x022fdd63cc95386dull) >> 58];
}
 But the c# compiler doesnt allow me to use "0x022fdd63cc95386dull" because it overflows 64bits. And i have to use "0x022fdd63cc95386d" instead. Using those codes. The problem is that i am not getting the correct result for the input given. For example, doing 1.000.000 calculations of the number: 17012389719861204799 (64bits used) This is the result: Using pow2 method i get the result 64 1 Million times in 1380ms. Using DeBruijn method i get the result 40 1 Million times in 32ms. (Dont know why 40) Im trying to understand how "De Bruijn" works, and how can i fix this and create a final code for c# to calculate up to 64bits numbers. UDPATE and benchmarks of different solutions I was looking for the fastest algorithm to get the number of digits in binary that a unsigned given number of 64bits has in c# (known as ulong). For example: 1024 has 11 binary digits. (2^10+1) or (log2[1024]+1) 9223372036854775808 has 64 binary digits. (2^63+1) or (log2[2^63]+1) The conventional power of 2 and square is extremely slow. and just for 10000 calculations it needs 1500ms to get the answer. (100M calculations needs hours). Here, Niklas B., Jim Mischel, and Spender brought differents methods to make this faster. SIMD and SWAR Techniques //Provided by Spender (Answer here) De_Bruijn Splited 32bits //Provided by Jim Mischel (Answer here) De_Bruijn 64bits version //Provided by Niklas B. (Answer here) De_Bruijn 128bits version //Also provided by Niklas B. (Answer here) Testing this Methods with a CPU Q6600 overclocked to 3Ghz using Windows 7 (64bits) Gives the following results. As you can see, it takes just a few seconds to find correctly 100,000,000 of request given, being De_Bruijn 128bits version the fastest. Thanks a lot to all of you, you help me a lot with this. I hope this helps you too.

@TITLE:Why do abstract classes need to define abstract methods from interfaces they implement?
@CONTENT:When an abstract class implements an interface, it is required to also either define or declare the methods (as asked before): public interface MyInterface
{
  void Method();
}

public abstract class MyAbstractClass : MyInterface
{
  public abstract void Method(); // required, even though MyAbstractClass does not implement
}

public class MyClass : MyAbstractClass
{
  public override void Method()
  {
  }
}

public interface MyInterface2 : MyInterface
{
  // no need to declare Method() -- why can't abstract classes do the same for unimplemented methods?
}
 What is the design rationale of the c# language to require the definition of abstract methods of abstract classes that implement interfaces? It seems completely redundant for an abstract class to be required to define a method that it does not implement (and to make it even worse, for the class that actually implements the method to have to mark the method as override). I see no reason why an abstract class could not behave like MyInterface2, which inherits from MyInterface but does not need to declare MyInterface's methods.
@CODE:public interface MyInterface
{
  void Method();
}

public abstract class MyAbstractClass : MyInterface
{
  public abstract void Method(); // required, even though MyAbstractClass does not implement
}

public class MyClass : MyAbstractClass
{
  public override void Method()
  {
  }

@CONTENT:I'm trying to create a custom TableCell in my TableView. I'd like it to display a ComboBox where I can choose a String value, and then display the String value as if it was an user input. The idea is that ths user doesn't know which are the allowed values so he can simply pick one of them in the ComboBox. I tried to do that making my own "ComboBoxCell" but it doesn't work as expected : public class ComboBoxCell extends TableCell<ClassesProperty, String> {

    private ComboBox<String> comboBox;

    public ComboBoxCell() {
    }

    @Override

        super.startEdit();

        if (comboBox == null) {
            createComboBox();

        setGraphic(comboBox);
        setContentDisplay(ContentDisplay.GRAPHIC_ONLY);
    }

    @Override
    public void cancelEdit() {
        super.cancelEdit();

        setText(String.valueOf(getItem()));
        setContentDisplay(ContentDisplay.TEXT_ONLY);
    }

    public void updateItem(String item, boolean empty) {
        super.updateItem(item, empty);

        if (empty) {
            setText(null);
            setGraphic(null);
        } else {
            if (isEditing()) {
                if (comboBox != null) {
                    comboBox.setValue(getString());
                }
                setGraphic(comboBox);
                setContentDisplay(ContentDisplay.GRAPHIC_ONLY);
            } else {
                setText(getString());
                setContentDisplay(ContentDisplay.TEXT_ONLY);
            }
        }
    }

    private void createComboBox() {
        // ClassesController.getLevelChoice() is the observable list of String
        comboBox = new ComboBox<>(ClassesController.getLevelChoice());
        comboBox.setMinWidth(this.getWidth() - this.getGraphicTextGap()*2);

 And scrollbar_blue refers to my scrollbar_blue.xml file, which is this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

If you look at the Android documentation on ScrollView, there is no corresponding method to android:scrollbarThumbVertical I'm fine with another way change the colour as well.

@CONTENT:I've simplified the question a bit. When I create and add regions in my app and interrogate the state of those regions I see the following in monitoringDidFailForRegion method: The operation couldn・t be completed. (kCLErrorDomain error 4.) Checking the CLErrorDomain constants I see that error 4 is kCLErrorRegionMonitoringDenied and it is described like so: Access to the region monitoring service was denied by the user.
 How is this possible? Here's my set up and what I've checked: I am working through Xcode to watch log statements. I am connected to my iPhone 5. I am not running in the simulator. I have ensured that the radius is sufficient in size to be monitored (though it shouldn't matter). I have ensured that Settings > Privacy > Location Services is on for my device and my app. I've read every Core Location and Region Monitoring document Apple has ever published. I have ensured that WiFi is on and that I have a strong cellular signal. If I didn't it wouldn't be able to find my location in the first place. I have ensured that didChangeAuthorizationStatus reports the correct status: kCLAuthorizationStatusAuthorized I have ensured that after adding my region that monitoring does in-fact begin by observing the call to the method didStartMonitoringForRegion. What am I missing? Why do I see this error when Location Services are clearly enabled?

@CONTENT:i have a funny json data looking as: [ {

      "address_id" : 2,
      "address" : "172.16.20.1/24"
    }, {

    } ]
  } ],
  "switch_id" : "0000000000000002"
} ]
 i wrote case classes and custom reads:   case class TheAddress(addr: (Int, String))
  implicit val theAddressReads: Reads[TheAddress] = (
    (__ \ "address_id").read[Int] and
      (__ \ "address").read[String] tupled) map (TheAddress.apply _)

  case class Addresses(addr: List[TheAddress])
  implicit val addressesReads: Reads[Addresses] =
    (__ \ "address").read(list[TheAddress](theAddressReads)) map (Addresses.apply _)

  case class TheSwitch(
    switch_id: String,
    address: List[Addresses] = Nil)
  implicit val theSwitchReads: Reads[TheSwitch] = (
    (__ \ "switch_id").read[String] and
    (__ \ "internal_network").read(list[Addresses](addressesReads)))(TheSwitch)

  case class Switches(col: List[TheSwitch])
  implicit val switchesReads: Reads[Switches] = 
    (__ \ "").read(list[TheSwitch](theSwitchReads)) map (Switches.apply _)
 when i validate the provided data with: val json: JsValue = Json.parse(jsonChunk)
println(json.validate[TheSwitch])
 i get: JsError(List((/switch_id,List(ValidationError(error.path.missing,WrappedArray()))), (/internal_network,List(ValidationError(error.path.missing,WrappedArray())))))
 i can access it with JsPath like val switches: Seq[String] = (json \\ "switch_id").map(_.as[String])
 but i'm really at my wits end with what am i doing wrong with custom reads. i've tried with putting another top level key, and other combinations, but seems i'm missing something crucial, since i've started with this just today. thanks a lot.

@TITLE:can I switch the grouping variable in a single dplyr statement?
@CONTENT:Here's a simple example to illustrate the issue: library(data.table)
dt = data.table(a = c(1,1,2,2), b = 1:2)

dt[, c := cumsum(a), by = b][, d := cumsum(a), by = c]
#   a b c d
#1: 1 1 1 1
#2: 1 2 1 2
#3: 2 1 3 2
#4: 2 2 3 4
 Attempting to do the same in dplyr I fail because the first group_by is persistent and the grouping is by both b and c: df = data.frame(a = c(1,1,2,2), b = 1:2)

df %.% group_by(b) %.% mutate(c = cumsum(a)) %.%
       group_by(c) %.% mutate(d = cumsum(a))
#  a b c d
#1 1 1 1 1
#2 1 2 1 1
#3 2 1 3 2

 Is this a bug or a feature? If it's a feature, then how would one replicate the data.table solution in a single statement?

@TITLE:implementing a directive to exclude a hidden input element from validation ($addControl issue)
@CONTENT:I'm creating a directive to exclude a hidden input element from validation: http://plnkr.co/edit/Vnwvq2AT7JpgTnoQwGh9?p=preview app.directive('shownValidation', function() {
    return {
      require: '^form',
      restrict: 'A',

            control = form[element.attr("name")];
          }
          if (value == true){
            form.$addControl(control);
          }else{
             form.$removeControl(control);
          }
        });
      }
    };
  });
 The idea here is if the element is hidden, I will remove the control from the Form so that it will not affect the other input validity. It works fine when I call form.$removeControl(control);, you can test that in the demo by removing the firstname and clicking on the button to hide the field. But when I click the button again, the form validity is still true even though the firstname is invalid (empty) I also tried adding form.$setValidity(form.$valid && control.$valid) => the validity state is updated as expected but when I type into the firstname, the validity is still false. My question is how to solve this problem? Thanks for any replies. Update: Thanks to @Michael's answer. Here is the working solution: app.directive('shownValidation', function() {
  return {
    require: '^form',
    restrict: 'A',
    link: function(scope, element, attrs, form) {
      var control;

      scope.$watch(attrs.ngShow, function(value) {
        if (!control) {
          control = form[element.attr("name")];
        }
        if (value == true) {
          form.$addControl(control);
     //Add a forEach to manually update form validity.Thanks to @Michael's answer
          angular.forEach(control.$error, function(validity, validationToken) {
            form.$setValidity(validationToken, !validity, control);
          });
        } else {
          form.$removeControl(control);
        }
      });
    }
  };
});

@CONTENT:I am deploying on Android 4.4 with v19 of the Android SDK on phonegap. I have an mp3 file in the same folder as my index.html file that I want to play using html5 audio tags. <html>
  <body>
  <audio controls>
    <source src='sound.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'>

E/        (  124): Failed to open file '/android_asset/www/sound.mp3'. (No such file or directory)
 It looks like a path issue, but I've tried all permutations I can think of. I think it is more fundamental, like AwesomePlayer can't access mp3s that are stored in the android_asset directory. Using the Media plugin for phonegap works fine as other answers have suggested, but since audio tags work for external media, and the Media plugin works for internal media, it seems like this should be easily fixable. I also have a huge working app that uses audio tags everywhere and I really don't want to rewrite it to use the Media plugin. Is there an easy obvious fix, or should I submit a bug report?

@TITLE:How to add a button in accordion header in bootstrap 3.0/bootstrap-ui?
@CONTENT:I am trying to add a button to the accordion that has a dropdown menu but it doesn't seem to be working a: 1) button is too big so it goes past the accordions header. 2) The dropdown menu ends up inside the accordion header/group and not on top of everything else. What is the best way to fix these? I want The following is my code for the accordion group: <accordion-group is-open="true">
    <accordion-heading>
        <div class="btn-group" style="float:right;">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Info</button>
        </div>   
    </accordion-heading>
</accordion-group>
 This post is similar, but I want the buttons to be on the right of the header instead of being right next to the text, which is why I have a float:left. Angular UI accordion with buttons in the header part
@CODE:<accordion-group is-open="true">
    <accordion-heading>
        <div class="btn-group" style="float:right;">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Info</button>
        </div>   
    </accordion-heading>

@TITLE:Sorting UNION queries with Laravel 4.1
@CONTENT:I think there is something changed in the union between Laravel 4 and Laravel 4.1. I have 2 models. $photos = DB::table('photos')->select('id', 'name', 'created_at');
$videos = DB::table('videos')->select('id', 'name', 'created_at');
 I want to union the 2 querys and order the 2 querys with the created_at field. $photos = $photos->orderBy('created_at', 'desc');
$combined = $photos->union($videos);
 With Laravel 4 it gives me this query: select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `videos`
union
select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `photos`
order by `created_at` desc
 This works ok, it sorts the results for both querys together. In Laravel 4.1 it gives me this query: (select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `videos`)
union
(select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `photos` order by `created_at` desc)
 This results in a list of videos and after that an ordered list of photos. I need to have a list where the to combined querys are sorted. I want Laravel to give me this query: (select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `videos`)
union
(select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `photos`)
order by `created_at` desc
 How do get this working in Laravel?
@CODE:union $photos = DB::table('photos')->select('id', 'name', 'created_at');
$videos = DB::table('videos')->select('id', 'name', 'created_at'); created_at $photos = $photos->orderBy('created_at', 'desc');
$combined = $photos->union($videos); select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `videos`
union
select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `photos`
order by `created_at` desc (select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `videos`)
union
(select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `photos` order by `created_at` desc) (select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `videos`)
union
(select `id`, `name`, `created_at` from `photos`)
order by `created_at` desc orderBy $photos $videos $combined->orderBy

@LINK:/questions/21463168/give-odata-service-document-base-url-a-trailing-slash-in-webapi-odata
@TITLE:Give OData service document base URL a trailing slash in WebApi OData
@CONTENT:How can I control the base URL attribute in the root element of an OData service document? I'm setting up an OData service using WebApi, the System.Web.Http.OData.Builder.ODataConventionModelBuilder and controllers inheriting from System.Web.Http.OData.ODataController It all works beautifully and Excel 2013 happily accesses the data. The problem arises when trying to use Excel 2010 and PowerPivot. I'm aware of the fix for JSON formatted responses being sent in the absence of an Accept header, but I can't find any discussion of problems with the base URL. I have set up my odata route with config.Routes.MapODataRoute("odata", "odata", builder.GetEdmModel()); and when I hit this URL I get a response of <service xml:base="http://localhost/odata" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/> Excel 2010 + PowerPivot reads this URL and decides that because there is no trailing slash on the base URI, it should request collections with URIs in the root, e.g. http://localhost/Products instead of http://localhost/odata/Products as it should. I have confirmed my suspicion by accessing a static version of the service document, modified to add the trailing slash to the base attribute value and the correct URL is then requested for the collection resource. I've tried working through the ASP.Net WebStack source code to see if I can override a formatter or something, but got lost. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
@CODE:System.Web.Http.OData.Builder.ODataConventionModelBuilder System.Web.Http.OData.ODataController config.Routes.MapODataRoute("odata", "odata", builder.GetEdmModel()); <service xml:base="http://localhost/odata" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/> http://localhost/Products http://localhost/odata/Products

@TITLE:Python List in a For Loop
@CONTENT:I am new to Python and had a question about updating a list using a for loop. Here is my code: urls = ['http://www.city-data.com/city/javascript:l("Abbott");' , 'http://www.city-data.com/city/javascript:l("Abernathy");' ,

'http://www.city-data.com/city/Abilene-Texas.html' ,'http://www.city-data.com/city/javascript:l("Abram-Perezville");' ,

'http://www.city-data.com/city/Addison-Texas.html']

for url in urls:
    if "javascript" in url:
        print url
        url = url.replace('javascript:l("','').replace('");','-Texas.html')
        print url

for url in urls:
    if "javascript" in url:
        url = url.replace('javascript:l("','').replace('");','-Texas.html')
print "\n"  
print urls
 I used the first for loop to check if the syntax was correct, and it worked fine. But the second for loop is the code I want to use, but it's not working properly. How would I go about globally updating the list with the second for loop so I can print or store the updated list outside of the for loop?

@TITLE:Android non-UI Fragment usage [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: What is the use case for a Fragment with no UI? 3 answers I am going through the Android documentation on Fragments . The layout that defines the UI of a Fragment may be defined in the layout of the Activity, in a separate .xml file or not at all. According to the documentation you can also use a fragment to provide a background behavior for the activity without presenting additional UI. Why would I need to use another Fragment to add functionality to an Activity instead of defining a few more functions within the Activity? Would such a non-UI Fragment be used just for the sake of modularity? Is there another reason for adopting such an approach? I would appreciate an example of when it is suitable to use a non-UI fragment. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

@TITLE:Can someone edit javascript file offline to run malicious code?
@CONTENT:I am worried about something related to javascript files of my website, I am not sure if this is doable. Js files will be downloaded when someone visits a website, what if someone edited the downloaded js script and inserted his own code, then refreshed the website. In the new refresh the website will read the edited Js file and will run the malicious code. The malicious code might be used to run some code at the server in normal ways. Example: A user is only allowed to post an article in his page: HTML Article form will only show for the user in his page. <?php
if( $user->id == $page->userID )
{
?>    
<form>
<h1>Add new article:</h1><br />
<textarea name="articleText" cols="65" rows="3"></textarea>
<input class="SubmitArticle" id="<?php echo $userPage->id; ?>" name="SubmitArticle" type="button" value="Submit article" />
</form>
<?php
}
?>
 Javascript $(".SubmitArticle").click( function(e){
    var targetPage = $(this).attr('id');
    var thisForm = $(this).parent();
    var postData = thisForm.serialize() + "&targetPage=" + targetPage;

    $.post(document.location, postData, function(data) {
        $('#mainDiv').html(data);
    });
});
 PHP if( isset($_POST["SubmitArticle"]) )
{
    $pageID = $_POST["targetPage"];
    $text = $_POST["articleText"];

    PublishArticle( $pageID , $text );
}
 Malicious Code: Code inserted in JS file to write article on other users pages (which is not allowed), the attacker reads page id from html element using view page source (lets say page_id=12): postData = "SubmitArticle=1&targetPage=12&articleText='Muwhahahah'";
$.post(document.location, postData, function(data) {
});
 What is the solution if this is possible?
@CODE:<?php
if( $user->id == $page->userID )
{
?>    
<form>
<h1>Add new article:</h1><br />
<textarea name="articleText" cols="65" rows="3"></textarea>

@TITLE:Display multiple output tables in IPython notebook using Pandas
@CONTENT:I now know that I can output multiple charts from IPython pandas by embedding them in one plot space which will appear in a single output cell in the notebook. Can I do something similar with Pandas HTML Tables? I am getting data from multiple tabs (about 15-20) on a spreadsheet and running them though a set of regressions and I'd like to display the results together, perhaps 2 up.. But since the function to display the table only displays one, the last one, not sure how to approach. Ideas? I'd even be happy to display in successive output cells.. not real sure how to do that either But I guess I could do something really dirty calling each (spreadsheet) tab in a separate cell.. Ughh... FWIW I'm on IPython 2.0 dev and Pandas 13

@TITLE:Use of the terms ：queues；, ：multicore；, and ：threads； in Grand Central Dispatch
@CONTENT:I am trying to get my head around the concepts of Grand Central Dispatch. I want to understand these quotes from Vandad's book on Concurrent Programming. The real use for GCD is to dispatch tasks to multiple cores, without making you the programmer, worry about which core is executing which task. and At the heart of GCD are dispatch queues. Dispatch queues are pools of threads. and finally You will not be working with these threads directly. You will just work with dispatch queues, dispatching tasks to these queues and asking queues to invoke your task. I have bolded the key terms. Are multiple cores the same as queues? Does a queue consist of many threads? Does each thread perform a task?

@TITLE:Chrome does not show network traffic of Silverlight RIA services messages after update to version 32.0.1700.76 m
@CONTENT:Couple days ago Google Chrome automatically updated from version 31.* to version 32.0.1700.76 m. After that happened it does not show in DevTools network traffic request/responses of "application/msbin1" type anymore. These requests are visible in all other browsers' dev tools (FireFox, IE) and in Fiddler, but not in Chrome. Also Chrome's popup menu in this version is very glitchy. I don't see the way to downgrade Chrome to previous version. Please help I don't want to uninstall Chrome. Network traffic does not even show resources (XAP file) a page loads. Example: http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/pixel-shader/demo/ This page loads file SilverlightShaderApp.xap, however dev tools of new Chrome's version never shows it in network tab. I posted the question here, because it's developers question, not just chrome users. I reported this issue on google chrome forum as well: here.

@TITLE:Stacked Area Chart in nvd3js - X Axis overflow
@CONTENT:I am trying to implement a 'Stacked Area Chart' with d3js and nvd3.js similar to this example. Additionally, I'd like to use a context brush like this one to select a date range, which effects the Stacked Area Chart. Actually, this is already working but somehow it draws some lines on top of the Y-Axis as soon as the selected date range does not contain the first date. Just have a look on the following picture: Here is my code: Stacked Area Chart var margin = {
    top : 10,
    right : 20,
    bottom : 100,
    left : 20
}, width = 960, height = 300;

function initStackChart() {
    nv.addGraph(function() {
        var chart = nv.models.stackedAreaChart().x(function(d) {
            return Date.parse(new Date(d[0]))
        }).y(function(d) {
            return d[1]
        }).clipEdge(false);

        chart.xAxis.tickFormat(function(d) {
            return d3.time.format('%x')(new Date(d))
        });

        chart.yAxis.tickFormat(d3.format(',.2f'));

        if (!!time_range) {
            chart.xDomain([time_range[0], time_range[1]]);
        }

        d3.select('#stack svg').datum(temp_data).transition().duration(100).call(chart);

        nv.utils.windowResize(chart.update);
        return chart;
    });
}

@TITLE:Why do browsers not send the Authentication header when the credentials are provided in the URL?
@CONTENT:I would like to give users the opportunity to do a per-request-authentication by providing the username and password in the URL. As the request is secure, I have no concerns on that. I tried to call the request http://user:password@localhost/ using a usual browser, (Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera was the ones I tested) and I got a 401 response back. When I tried the same URI, but this time provided the credentials as HTTP-header like Authentication: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==, it worked. When searching for that, I found this answer to another question: http://serverfault.com/questions/371907/can-you-pass-user-pass-for-http-basic-authentication-in-url-parameters#answer-371918 This answer claims, that the browser should automatically generate the Authentication header out of the credentials provided in the URL. When trying it on the command line using curl, it works. So, why doesn't it work in the browser? Has this something to do with security? Firefox is the only one claiming: You are about to log in to the site "localhost" with the username "user", but the website does not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you. Is "localhost" the site you want to visit? But when confirming this request by clicking on yes, it sends the request without credentials. At least, I can't see them in the network-tab of firebug ... and the response is a 401, too.

@TITLE:Regex pattern to choose data BETWEEN matching quotation marks
@CONTENT:Suppose I had the following string I wanted to run a Regular expression on: This is a test string with "quotation-marks" within it.
The "problem" I am having, per-se, is "knowing" which "quotation-marks"
go with which words.
 Now, suppose I wanted to replace all the - characters between the quotation marks with, say, a space. I was thinking I could do so with a regex looking as follows: Find What:      (\"[^"]*?)(\-)([^"]*?\")
Replace With:   $1 $3
 The problem I'm having is that using this pattern, it does not take into account whether a quotation mark was opening or closing the statement. So, in the example above, the - character in per-se will be replaced by a space since it is between 2 quotation marks, but between a closing and an opening mark - When I specifically want to look within the text between an opening and a closing mark. How do you account for this in such a regular expression? I hope this makes sense. I'm using VB / C# Regex. Just to complete the question (and hopefully elaborate a bit more if necessary), the end result I would like to get would be: This is a test string with "quotation marks" within it.
The "problem" I am having, per-se, is "knowing" which "quotation marks"

@TITLE:Converting MultipartFile to java.io.File without copying to local machine
@CONTENT:I have a Java Spring MVC web application. From client, through AngularJS, I am uploading a file and posting it to Controller as webservice. In my Controller, I am gettinfg it as MultipartFile and I can copy it to local machine. But I want to upload the file to Amazone S3 bucket. So I have to convert it to java.io.File. Right now what I am doing is, I am copying it to local machine and then uploading to S3 using jets3t. Here is my way of converting in controller MultipartHttpServletRequest mRequest=(MultipartHttpServletRequest)request;

Iterator<String> itr=mRequest.getFileNames();
        while(itr.hasNext()){
            MultipartFile mFile=mRequest.getFile(itr.next());
            String fileName=mFile.getOriginalFilename();

            fileLoc="/home/mydocs/my-uploads/"+date+"_"+fileName; //date is String form of current date.
 Then I am using FIleCopyUtils of SpringFramework File newFile = new File(fileLoc);

                  // if the directory does not exist, create it
                  if (!newFile.getParentFile().exists()) {
                    newFile.getParentFile().mkdirs();  
                  }
                FileCopyUtils.copy(mFile.getBytes(), newFile);
 So it will create a new file in the local machine. That file I am uplaoding in S3 S3Object fileObject = new S3Object(newFile);

s3Service.putObject("myBucket", fileObject);
 It creates file in my local system. I don't want to create. Without creating a file in local system, how to convert a MultipartFIle to java.io.File?
@CODE:MultipartHttpServletRequest mRequest=(MultipartHttpServletRequest)request;

Iterator<String> itr=mRequest.getFileNames();
        while(itr.hasNext()){
            MultipartFile mFile=mRequest.getFile(itr.next());
            String fileName=mFile.getOriginalFilename();

            fileLoc="/home/mydocs/my-uploads/"+date+"_"+fileName; //date is String form of current date. File newFile = new File(fileLoc);

                  // if the directory does not exist, create it
                  if (!newFile.getParentFile().exists()) {
                    newFile.getParentFile().mkdirs();  
                  }
                FileCopyUtils.copy(mFile.getBytes(), newFile); S3Object fileObject = new S3Object(newFile);

@LINK:/questions/21068714/trap-all-accesses-to-an-address-range-linux
@TITLE:Trap all accesses to an address range (Linux)
@CONTENT:Background I'm writing a framework to enable co-simulation of RTL running in a simulator and un-modified host software. The host software is written to control actual hardware and typically works in one of two ways: Read/Write calls through a driver Memory mapped access using mmap The former case is pretty straightforward - write a library that implements the same read / write calls as the driver and link against that when running a simulation. This all works wonderfully and I can run un-modified production software as stimulus for my RTL simulations. The second case is turning out to be far more difficult than the first... Trapping mmap Initially I thought I could use LD_PRELOAD to intercept the mmap call. In my implementation of mmap I'd allocate some page-aligned memory and then mprotect it and set a signal handler to trap SIGSEGV. There are numerous problems with this approach: Read vs Write I can determine the address of the access from siginfo_t->si_addr but not whether the access was read or write. Catching repeat accesses In the signal handler I need to un-protect the memory region, otherwise the I'll get repeat SIGSEGVs as soon as my handler exits and the host code can never continue. However if I unprotect the region then my signal handler won't trap subsequent accesses. Signal handler nastiness To block in a signal handler while the simulator drives the RTL and returns a result violates all sorts of programming rules - particularly given the simulator could trigger all sorts of other events and execute arbitrary code before returning a result from this access. Other approaches I was wondering if it's possible to create a file-like object that behaves like a disk rather than using mprotect on a buffer. I haven't found any information suggesting this is feasible. Questions Is it possible to trap all accesses to an mmap region and how? Accesses need to block for an indeterminate period of time (while simulator runs) Read accesses need to retrieve a new value placed by my trap Assuming LD_PRELOAD and mprotect is the best route: Can I determine whether the access was a read or a write call? How do I trap subsequent accesses since I have to un-mprotect the region? Related Questions Write a signal handler to catch SIGSEGV Possible to trap write to address (x86 - linux)

@LINK:/questions/21055920/handling-exceptions-from-the-synchronous-part-of-async-method
@TITLE:Handling exceptions from the synchronous part of async method
@CONTENT:I'm dealing with the situation where the task I start may throw, while still executing synchronously on the initial thread. Something like this, for illustrative purposes: static async Task TestAsync()
{
    var random = new Random(Environment.TickCount).Next();
    if (random % 2 != 0)
        throw new ApplicationException("1st");

    await Task.Delay(2000);
    Console.WriteLine("after await Task.Delay");
    throw new ApplicationException("2nd");
}
 From the calling code, I'd like to be able to catch any exceptions, possibly thrown from the synchronous part (i.e., until await Task.Delay()). Here's how I'm currently doing it: static void Main(string[] args)
{
    try
    {
        var task = TestAsync();
        if (task.IsFaulted)
            task.GetAwaiter().GetResult();
        Console.WriteLine("TestAsync continues asynchronously...");
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: " + e.ToString());
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to exit...");
    Console.ReadLine();
}
 This works, although it looks a bit mouthful, as there is no Result on the Task. I've also tried task.Wait() instead of task.GetAwaiter().GetResult(). That always gives me AggregateException which I have to unwrap (rather than expected ApplicationException directly). Is there any other options? [EDITED] To address the comments: I do this, because if the task fails instantly, I don't want to add it to the list of the pending tasks I maintain. The task itself knows nothing about such a list (and it doesn't have to). I still want to log the exception, and make user aware of it. I could also do throw task.Exception, but that wouldn't give the exception stack frame captured with ExceptionDispatchInfo. [UPDATE] Inspired by other answers and comments: if I have full control over TestAsync and I don't want introducing new class members, I also could do something like below. It might come handy when validating arguments: static Task TestAsync(int delay)
{
    if (delay < 0)
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("delay");

    Func<Task> asyncPart = async () =>
    {

How that dynamic type matching can be accomplished in C++ is the subject of this question. At present, the architecture is implemented in C#, relying heavily on reflection, as you'll see. However, I am now in the process of redesigning the whole thing for C++, but since C++ doesn't have reflection (and since I am new to C++) I need some input on how to best replicate this functionality without it. Here's how it's currently done in C# (simplified & pseudo): All plugins are descendants of a Plugin class. Each surface type is tagged with a 'target plugin type', indicating the most specific / deepest descendant of Plugin it is designed for. The most generic of the surfaces is one that just handles the level of Plugin (just showing a name label, for example). This guarantees that all plugins will have at least one surface capable of representing them on screen, even if it doesn't provide any useful means of interaction. Let's call this "baseline" surface type for PluginSurface. If - for the sake of brevity here (in reality it's done via Class Attributes) - we use a property on surfaces to indicate their target type, we'd have PluginSurface.TargetType = typeof(Plugin)
 Unless more specific surfaces are added, all plugins would be assigned this generic surface, no matter where they are in the Plugin inheritance hierarchy. Now, let's say we add a new plugin type called Father, deriving from Plugin: Father : Plugin
 Then we add a few more, to create a little sample hierarchy: Mother : Plugin
Daughter : Father
Son1 : Mother
Son2 : Mother
Grandson : Son1
 At this point, all of these would be represented on screen by the generic PluginSurface. So we create additional surfaces to more specifically handle the functionality of the new plugins (all surfaces descend from PluginSurface): MotherSurface.TargetType = typeof(Mother)
GrandsonSurface.TargetType = typeof(Grandson)
 From this, the effective type matching of plugin-to-surface should be: Father -> PluginSurface
Daughter -> PluginSurface
Mother -> MotherSurface
Son1 -> MotherSurface
Son2 -> MotherSurface
Grandson -> GrandsonSurface
 Ok, so this is the mapping we expect to end up with. Essentially, the matching is implemented as a static function in the host that takes the plugin type and returns an instance of the best-fit-surface: PluginSurface GetBestFitSurface(Type pluginType)
 The function iterates through all the available surfaces and checks their TargetType property against the supplied pluginType. More specifically, it checks whether the TargetType IsAssignableFrom the pluginType. It creates a list of all the positive matches. It then needs to narrow down this list of candidates to the best fit. For that I do a similar check of assignability, but this time between all the candidates' TargetTypes, checking each one against each of the others, and for each candidate I make a note of how many of the other candidates' TargetTypes its TargetType is assignable to. The candidate whose TargetType can be assigned (i.e. cast) to the most other TargetTypes is the best fit. What happens later is that this surface becomes a wrapper around the plugin in question, arranging itself on screen to reflect the features of that plugin it "understands", depending of the tightness of the fit. A GrandsonSurface is specifically designed to represent GrandSon, so it will be a complete UI for that plugin. But Son1 and Son2 are "only" getting a MotherSurface, so any features they don't have in common with Mother will not be included in their UI representation (until a more specialized Son interface is made, at which point that will be the best fit etc). Note that this the intended use - normally, the Mother plugin would be abstract and the interface targeting it would really be a Son interface, intended to wrap all of Mother's children. Thus a single surface provides the UI for a whole class of similarly featured plugins. How can this best be done in C++ without the support of reflection? I suppose the challenge is to smoke out the C++ analog to C#'s Type.IsAssignableFrom(Type) where both Types are dynamically attributed.. I'm looking in the direction of dynamic_cast and typeid, but so far I haven't gotten a firm grasp on how to go about it. Any tips on architecture, pattern or implementation details would be greatly appreciated. Edit 1: I think I have solved the main problem here (see my own answer below, which includes a [very] rough C++ implementation), but there might be better patterns. Feel free to rip it apart. Edit 2: An improved model is presented in a follow-up question found here: ：Poor Man's Reflection； (AKA bottom-up reflection) in C++.

@TITLE:Difference in scope between directive with template and without template AND between Angular 1.2 and 1.1?
@CONTENT:I am new to Angular and trying to understand advanced directive API - I want to re-create directive template in compile function using directive element attributes. But when I don't have a template set (or template is empty string) instead accesing isolated directive scope I access parent (controller) scope. Also - this works on Angular 1.1 but not 1.2 here is HTML: <div class="container" ng-app="app" ng-controller="AppController">
      <sandbox title="Attribute Title"></sandbox>
</div>
 JavaScript: var app = angular.module('app', [], function () {});

app.controller('AppController', function ($scope) {
    $scope.title = "AppController title";
});

app.directive('sandbox', function ($log, $compile) {
    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        scope: {
            title: "@"
        },
        controller: function ($scope, $element, $attrs) {
            $scope.title = "Directive Controller title";
        },
        template: '<h1>Template</h1>', // change it to: '' and Run, than change Angular to 1.2.x
        compile: function (tElement, tAttrs) {
            tElement.append('<h2> Title = {{ title }}</h2>');
        }
    }

});
 When you Run it you get: Template Title = Attribute Title But when you change template to empty string you get with Angular 1.2: Title = AppController Title And with Angular 1.1.1: Title = Attribute Title My Questions: Why there is a difference in accesing scope when template is set AND when it's not set? Why there is a difference between Angular 1.1 and 1.2 (bug? - directive without 'template'and with isoleted scope acceses controller scope not directive scope ) ? How can I build template that accesses isolated scope NOT parent scope in Angular 1.2 in compile function ? Why directive controller function does not change 'title' using $scope.title = "..." - but when debugging 'scope' param in 'link' function 'title' value is 'Directive Controler Title' but it internally (WHERE to look for it) binds isoleted scope 'Attribute Value' ? Here is JSFiddle to play with: http://jsfiddle.net/yoorek/zQ66L/4/
@CODE:<div class="container" ng-app="app" ng-controller="AppController">
      <sandbox title="Attribute Title"></sandbox>
</div> var app = angular.module('app', [], function () {});

app.controller('AppController', function ($scope) {
    $scope.title = "AppController title";
});

app.directive('sandbox', function ($log, $compile) {
    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        scope: {
            title: "@"
        },
        controller: function ($scope, $element, $attrs) {
            $scope.title = "Directive Controller title";
        },
        template: '<h1>Template</h1>', // change it to: '' and Run, than change Angular to 1.2.x
        compile: function (tElement, tAttrs) {
            tElement.append('<h2> Title = {{ title }}</h2>');
        }
    }

@TITLE:Allow anonymous to ASP.NET Web API controller while rest of the application runs under windows authentication
@CONTENT:I have an ASP.NET web application that has Windows authentication enabled. I need to write an ASP.NET Web API controller in that application that uses some of the data access logic of the application. I don't want to create a new project for the Web API alone as I need to expose just a small end point that handles a couple of requests. The Web API clients would consume the service anonymously. To allow this, I tried using AllowAnonymous action filter on both controller as well as the actions. But, when I try hitting the API using Fiddler, the request fails with status 401 saying "401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials". Is there a way to achieve this?

@LINK:/questions/20765870/how-to-communicate-between-multiple-windows-of-the-same-chrome-app
@TITLE:How to communicate between multiple windows of the same chrome app?
@CONTENT:When using chrome developer tools, it appears that each app window (and the background 'page') has its own javascript context (space of objects, thread of execution), and yet the createdWindow callback of chrome.app.window.create apparently provides direct access to the objects of the 'other' window that was just created. Given that, I'm unclear on the best way to communicate between windows; e.g. if I open a second window to act as a dialog box, when the user clicks OK to save changes, should I be using postMessage, sendMessage, or just call a function on an object in the main window. I've looked at the messaging samples, and they seem focused on communication between two different apps, or between an app and an extension. So, I'm seeking a clear description of the memory and execution model within one app. Are there really separate contexts, or is it just one space of objects, with one thread of execution? What is the best way to communicate between windows of the same chrome app?

@LINK:/questions/20736330/concentric-circles-like-a-grid-centered-at-origin
@TITLE:Concentric Circles like a grid, centered at origin
@CONTENT:I would like to include a sequence of concentric circles as a grid in a plot of points. The goal is to give the viewer an idea of which points in the plot have approximately the same magnitude. I created a hack to do this: add_circle_grid <- function(g,ncirc = 10){
  gb <-  ggplot_build(g)
  xl <- gb$panel$ranges[[1]]$x.range
  yl <- gb$panel$ranges[[1]]$y.range
  rmax = sqrt(max(xl)^2+max(yl)^2)
  theta=seq(from=0,by=.01,to=2*pi)
  for(n in 1:ncirc){
    r <- n*rmax/ncirc
    circle <- data.frame(x=r*sin(theta),y=r*cos(theta))
    g<- g+geom_path(data=circle,aes(x=x,y=y),alpha=.2)
  }
  return(g+xlim(xl)+ylim(yl))
}

xy<-data.frame(x=rnorm(100),y=rnorm(100))
ggplot(xy,aes(x,y))+geom_point()
ggg<-add_circle_grid(ggplot(xy,aes(x,y))+geom_point())
print(ggg)
 But I was wondering if there is a more ggplot way to do this. I also considered using polar coordinates but it does not allow me to set x- and y-limits in the same way. Finally, I wouldn't mind little text labels indicating the radius of each circle. EDIT Perhaps this is asking too much but there are two other things that I would like. The axis limits should stay the same (which can be done via ggplot_build) Can this work with facets? As far as I can tell you would need to somehow figure out the facets if I want to add the circles dynamically.
@CODE:add_circle_grid <- function(g,ncirc = 10){
  gb <-  ggplot_build(g)
  xl <- gb$panel$ranges[[1]]$x.range
  yl <- gb$panel$ranges[[1]]$y.range

@TITLE:How to process huge text files that contain EOF / Ctrl-Z characters using Python on Windows?
@CONTENT:I have a number of large comma-delimited text files (the biggest is about 15GB) that I need to process using a Python script. The problem is that the files sporadically contain DOS EOF (Ctrl-Z) characters in the middle of them. (Don't ask me why, I didn't generate them.) The other problem is that the files are on a Windows machine. On Windows, when my script encounters one of these characters, it assumes it is at the end of the file and stops processing. For various reasons, I am not allowed to copy the files to any other machine. But I still need to process them. Here are my ideas so far: Read the file in binary mode, throwing out bytes that equal chr(26). This would work, but it would take approximately forever. Use something like sed to eliminate the EOF characters. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, sed on Windows has the same problem and will quit when it sees the EOF. Use some kind of Notepad program and do a find-and-replace. But it turns out that Notepad-type programs don't cope well with 15GB files. My IDEAL solution would be some way to just read the file as text and simply ignore the Ctrl-Z characters. Is there a reasonable way to accomplish this?

@TITLE:How can I set the visibility of an ActionBar item in different fragment
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a way to set the visibility of a MenuItem inflated in my MainActivity depending on which Fragment I am on. For information: I'm using actionBarSherlock, zxing, and some google services. The application was built with a Navigation drawer(With abs), also I manipulate the FragmentStack in such way I everytime I switch to another Fragment when I press the touch back I come back in my Main Fragment. Here my menu: <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
   <item android:id="@+id/button_generator" android:title="GENERER" android:icon="@drawable/ic_drawer"></item>
</menu>
 Here is where I inflate the menu:  @Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    Log.d(TAG, "================= onCreateOptionsMenu ================= fragSt: " + fragmentStatus);
    this.getSherlock().getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);

    mGenQrFromContacts = menu.findItem(R.id.button_generator);


    return true;
}
 I've tried the solution purposed here, but ain't work in my case.
@CODE:MenuItem Fragment actionBarSherlock zxing google services FragmentStack Main Fragment <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >
   <item android:id="@+id/button_generator" android:title="GENERER" android:icon="@drawable/ic_drawer"></item>

public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    Log.d(TAG, "================= onCreateOptionsMenu ================= fragSt: " + fragmentStatus);
    this.getSherlock().getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);

    mGenQrFromContacts = menu.findItem(R.id.button_generator);

@LINK:/questions/20685346/bootstrap-3-off-canvas-sidebar-menu-like-facebooks
@TITLE:Bootstrap 3 Off-Canvas Sidebar Menu Like Facebook's
@CONTENT:I'm using some examples of Bootstrap 3 for an off-canvas sidebar menu when it gets to mobile which can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/AllenDB/9aAjJ/ How would I go about getting the off-canvas menu adjusted to act like Facebook's search/friends online off-canvas menu to where it always starts at the top of the menu and you can only scroll within? As with my example the navbar is fixed so one may toggle the sidebar menu. But when you have scrolled down the actual page and toggle the menu you have to scroll back up to see the links. I would like to see how can I get this adjusted to where the menu starts at the top and pushes the content and fixed navbar to the side while being able to scroll within the menu and not the content? The CSS:     html,
    body { overflow-x: hidden; }
    body { padding-top: 70px;}
    .navbar { color: #FFF; }
    footer { padding: 30px 0; }

@CONTENT:I am fairly new to Python and trying to install the Pillow package on Windows 7. I downloaded and ran the MS Windows installer Pillow-2.2.1.win-amd64-py3.3.exe from here. It appeared to install fine. If I run the simple line of code: from PIL import Image
 directly from the Python interpreter, it runs fine. A help() on PIL gives me the package contents. But when I try to run the same line of code from within a script, I get an ImportError: No module named PIL. What am I missing? (Note that I've been able to import sys and import MySQLdb from within scripts just fine.) Resolved: sure, enough, I'm running Python 2.7 when I run scripts. (I think I vaguely recall having to install an older version so I could interface with MySQL.) Thank you all for pointing out that I should check the version being used.

@TITLE:Is there a way to disable short circuit evaluation in Java?
@CONTENT:Say I have code like this: boolean ret = a() && b() && c() && d() && e();
 Usually e() is only called if all other calls a()-d() return true. Is there maybe some compiler or JVM option to disable short circuit evaluation, so e() would be called always, regardless of other functions' results? Basically I am doing UAT of huge system and need to test e(), however setting up environment and scenario that assures all a(), b() etc. return true is extremely painful... EDIT: ok, I guess using bit AND instead of logical one could provide SOME sort of workaround, however ideally I am looking for a solution that does not require ANY CHANGES in the source code. Both due to formal and technical reason (as i mentioned system is big and we have whole process of promoting and deploying code between staging areas and getting sign-offs). And this is for testing only, production version needs to have lazy evaluation enabled (i.e. use &&) POST-MORTEM: "Correct" answer is: No, there is not. "Useful" answer: you can change && to & "What I did in the end" answer: debug system remotely, put breakpoint on expression and told eclipse to run e() -_-

$.getJSON('http://domain.com?r=appsync/read&id=table1&callback=', function(data){
        masterData[value] = data;
        storage.set(value,data);
      }),
$.getJSON('http://domain.com?r=appsync/read&id=table2&callback=', function(data){
        masterData[value] = data;
        storage.set(value,data);
      }),
//more calls
).done(function(){
console.log('all done');
});
 However I was wondering if there is a way of doing above the proper way *storage is a HTML5 localStorage jQuery plugin
@CODE:var masterData = {};
var tableNames = ['table1','table2','table3','table4','table5','table6'];
var pullSqlData = function(){
  tableNames.forEach(function(value) {
    if(storage.isEmpty(value)) {
      $.getJSON('http://domain.com?r=appsync/read&id='+value+ "&callback=", function(data){
        masterData[value] = data;
        storage.set(value,data);
      });
    } else {
      masterData[value] = storage.get(value);
    }
  });
};

$.when(pullSqlData()).done(function(){
console.log('all done');
}); $.when(
$.getJSON('http://domain.com?r=appsync/read&id=table1&callback=', function(data){
        masterData[value] = data;
        storage.set(value,data);
      }),
$.getJSON('http://domain.com?r=appsync/read&id=table2&callback=', function(data){
        masterData[value] = data;
        storage.set(value,data);
      }),
//more calls
).done(function(){
console.log('all done');
});

@CONTENT:I'm trying to do a variable replacement while also making it clickable with ngClick. I made a plunker demo (click the button and observe that the input box stays unchanged) Markup: <body ng-controller="Ctrl">

var app = angular.module('myApp', ['pascalprecht.translate', 'ngSanitize']);

  // add translation table
  $translateProvider.translations(translations);

@CONTENT:So I have a table of "person" data, which has a unique key "id". I have a list of id's that I want to get the data for which I'll be sending as a JSON array from the client to the server. The serve recieves that data as a JSON array. Now is there a way to run a query that will get the documents for each of those ids? Or is my only option to parse the ids myself and build an array of results, then send that array back. So far I've tried using... getAll - but I cannot get this to work because it accepts a dynamic amount of parameters, and I don't know how to change my array of values into a dynamic amount of parameters. (example... I want to be able to do whats shown below, but I can't) r.db('vp').table('user').getAll(["0", "0", "99"])
 I can only do this... r.db('vp').table('user').getAll("0", "0", "99")
 expr and forEach - as seen below, but I don't think this can work. var arr = [];
r.expr(["0", "0", "99"]).forEach(function(id) {

})

@CONTENT:I'm building a WP8 app and I need to perform around 30 web requests. These requests don't depend on each other so they could be parallelized. My code looks like this (simplified/pseudocode): foreach (Uri uri in uris)

    var processedData = dataProcessor.Process(rawData);
    processedDataCollection.Add(processedData);
}
 When I look at Fiddler, the requests are all performed sequantial; it takes a few seconds to perform and process all of them. However, I don't want the code to wait until 1 request is finished before moving to the next one, I want to perform multiple requests at the same time. Normally I would use Parallel.Invoke() or Parallel.ForEach() or something like that to do this, but apparently the Parallel library is not available in Windows Phone 8. So what's the best way to accomplish this? Task.Factory.StartNew()? new Thread()?

@CONTENT:I am trying to use Android Lint to keep my code running smoothly but since I'm using support-v7-appcompat, Lint returns an enormous, overflowing list of warnings. How can I suppress all of them so I can only see issues with my own app? In the Lint Overflow menu, there are options for "Check all Projects", "check android-support-v7-appcompat", and "check [myapp]" - but clicking [myapp] also shows a vast amount of errors regarding abc_ (support library) and trying to suppress them by selecting them and pressing "ignore in this project" doesn't work! As soon as I click "check [myapp]" again, the same lint errors show up. I can only assume this isn't intended behavior of lint! What can I do to improve this? Regards,

@TITLE:Is having a fragment with every activity a good practice (based on Android Studio)?
@CONTENT:In the new Android Studio, every time I create an activity from the wizard it will create the following structure: public class LoginActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_login);

        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
                    .add(R.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment())
                    .commit();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.login, menu);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        switch (item.getItemId()) {
            case R.id.action_settings:
                return true;
        }
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }

    public static class PlaceholderFragment extends Fragment {

        public PlaceholderFragment() {
        }

        @Override
        public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            View rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_login, container, false);
            return rootView;
        }
    }

}
 Notice there's the activity and it contains a fragment place holder. Is this considered a good practice? is it because if you wanted in the future to support tablets or replace fragment then you could (and thats why its the new default in Android studio?).
@CODE:public class LoginActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

                    .add(R.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment())
                    .commit();
        }
    }

@TITLE:How to Pass parameter in ADO.NET Source SSIS
@CONTENT:Hello I need some help This will be my first SSIS package and I am learning as I go. So far this is what I have. I created a Control Flow. Then I created three ADO.Net connections, twofor source and one for destination. Then I created data flow tasks it copies data from a table in one database into a corresponding table in another database on the same server. data flow task has an 2 ADO NET Source and ADO NET Destination. The destination simply maps the fields together. Okay, so far so good. This is my problem. Some of the source queries have date criteria. An example would be: SELECT --Code Here 
WHERE CONVERT(varchar, call_date, 112) BETWEEN '6/1/2013' AND  '7/1/2013'
 I want to replace these hard-coded dates with variables. Something like: WHERE CONVERT(varchar, call_date, 112) BETWEEN STARTDATE AND ENDATE
 I've read several posts and tried to do what is being described, but it's not sinking in. So please use my example to tell me how to do this. It would be nice if I could have the package prompt me for the Date when I run it, but I'd be very happy just to learn how to pass a variable into the query. This is the only solution I know because I just a beginner here in SSIS package I hope someone can help me
@CODE:SELECT --Code Here

@TITLE:eclipse maven error: Archive for required library in project cannot be read or is not a valid ZIP file
@CONTENT:In an eclipse maven project using spring web mvc, I am getting the following error in the Markers tab: Archive for required library: 'D:/mypath/.m2/repository/javax/transaction/jta/1.0.1B/jta-1.0.1B.jar' in project 'DocumentManager' cannot be read or is not a valid ZIP file
 I have checked, and the jar file is in fact present in the url indicated. I even copied a backup of the jar to overwrite the jar file in that location, but that did not get rid of the error either. I forced maven to update, which did not solve the problem. I also restarted eclipse to no effect. At one point, jta-1.0.1B.jar had been jta-1.0.1B.jar.LatestUpdate, so I shortened the name to jta-1.0.1B.jar In pom.xml, the location of the error message is line 2, which reads as follows: xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">  
 When I download jta-1.0.1B.jar manually from this url, the error in pom.xml goes away but is replaced with new errors in .java class files indicating that 5 methods of the Document class are not valid. I read this and this, but I am not using struts, I am already including 3.3.2.ga of hibernate, and I do not have a repository tag in pom.xml (which this said did not even solve the problem anyway), so I do not think this is a duplicate. Can anyone suggest a way to fix this problem? If I need a repository tag, where do I put it? And what else do I change to accommodate its addition? For anyone who is curious, my pom.xml is included for reference as follows: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

@CONTENT:I know that assignment is a statement in Python, i.e., it doesn't evaluate to a value unlike an expression. How does the following line of code work in Python, then? Please explain what happens internally in the Python interpreter (lexing, parsing, formation of abstract syntax tree). # this works
spam = eggs = 'ham'

# this doesn't work. Throws SyntaxError
spam = (eggs = 'ham')

@CONTENT:I am trying to deploy an ASP.NET application the Windows Azure cloud. I am using Google API for one of the calls in the application. When I do this, I get the following error: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'Google.Apis.Auth' is denied.` ASP.NET is not authorized to access the requested resource. Consider granting access rights to the resource to the ASP.NET request identity. ASP.NET has a base process identity (typically {MACHINE}\ASPNET on IIS 5 or Network Service on IIS 6 and IIS 7, and the configured application pool identity on IIS 7.5) that is used if the application is not impersonating. If the application is impersonating via , the identity will be the anonymous user (typically IUSR_MACHINENAME) or the authenticated request user.` To grant ASP.NET access to a file, right-click the file in File Explorer, choose "Properties" and select the Security tab. Click "Add" to add the appropriate user or group. Highlight the ASP.NET account, and check the boxes for the desired access.` I tried researching this, but all the suggestions talk about changing the IIS server settings, which I don't believe I have access to since this is running in the cloud.

@CONTENT:This question builds from the SO post found here and uses code that was modified from a post on the R-help mailing list which can be seen here I am trying to extract a random sample of rows in a data frame but with a conditional. Using the R iris data which looks like: > head(iris)
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa

6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa 
 To take a simple random sample, the code below works fine to take a sample of 2 rows. iris[sample(nrow(iris), 2), ]
 However I am unsure how to condition the Species field. For example how to take the random sample as indicated above but only when Species != ：setosa； There are three categories of iris$Species > summary(iris$Species)
    setosa versicolor  virginica 
        50         50         50
 I am unsure how to correctly nest conditionals. One of my earlier attempts is below with the obviously incorrect results includedK. > iris[sample(nrow(iris)[iris$Species != "setosa"], 2), ]
     Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species

@TITLE:Persisting query string with AngularJS routing
@CONTENT:I've been working on a large Angular app for almost a year now and I'm stuck trying to do what I expected to be trivial. Here are two routes I have with params (shortened for brevity): /a/:id
/a/:id/b
 Let's say the user is at /a/1 and the query string is modified, for example: /#/a/1?foo=123&bar=456
 I want to have a link on the page that directs the user to the second route /a/1/b while maintaining the query string, so the end result is a redirection to: /#/a/1/b?foo=123&bar=456
 I am using Angular 1.2 and the new ngRoute module. What is the best way to achieve this behavior? Edit: I should mention I have a working solution right now that seems terrible to me. The link is bound to an ng-click handler which is essentially the following: $scope.navigateToBClick = function() {
  var path = $location.path() + '/b',
    search = $location.search();
  $location.url(path + '?' + $.param(search));
};
@CODE:/a/:id
/a/:id/b /a/1 /#/a/1?foo=123&bar=456 /a/1/b /#/a/1/b?foo=123&bar=456 ng-click $scope.navigateToBClick = function() {

@CONTENT:I'm using file uploading for images into a BLOB in a MySQL database, for some reason when I upload some pictures I noticed they weren't completely rendered, I then tried uploading directly into PHPMyAdmin when it then showed (Max: 64KiB) I luckily enough run my own server so I thought to go check my php.ini for max file upload size, it's set to 250MB. So my question is, Where is the max filesize for MySQL BLOB Uploads??

@TITLE:Using dateutil.parser to parse a date in another language
@CONTENT:Dateutil is a great tool for parsing dates in string format. for example from dateutil.parser import parse
parse("Tue, 01 Oct 2013 14:26:00 -0300")
 returns datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 1, 14, 26, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -10800))
 however, parse("Ter, 01 Out 2013 14:26:00 -0300") # In portuguese
 yields this error: ValueError: unknown string format
 Does anybody know how to make dateutil aware of the locale?

@TITLE:Element-Wise Matrix Multiplication in Rcpp
@CONTENT:I am working on a code that requires an element-wise matrix multiplication. I am trying to implement this in Rcpp since the code requires some expensive loops. I am fairly new to Rcpp, and may be missing something, but I cannot get the element-wise matrix multiplication to work. // [[Rcpp::export]]

NumericMatrix multMat(NumericMatrix m1, NumericMatrix m2) {
    NumericMatrix multMatrix = m1 * m2 // How can this be implemented ?
}
 I may be missing something very trivial, and wanted to ask if there was any method to do this (other than using loops to iterate over each element and multiply). Thanks in advance.

    $pass = 'testing1234'
    $query->bind_param('s', $userObj->getUsername());
    $query->execute();
    $query->bind_result($userid, $hash);

 I get 'Password is valid!' I believe my problem is something to do with single and double quotes and the interpretation of dollar sign ($) in the password field, as a variable instead of literal (as one of the articles suggests) when storing/retrieving from MySQL database - however I haven't had any luck in resolving.

</div>
 When this code is run I see the tab but no calendar content. If I remove the 'class="tab-content"' from the second div then the tab and calendar displays ok but I'm not getting the tab functionality. There's obviously some contention between the two pieces of software under the hood. Anyone got a workaround ?

Interacting with the manager allows me to alter certain properties of a given type.

 You can see in RoomTypes: FenwayRoom __invalid_name__Fenway Room { get; set; } I'm wondering if their spec for the JSON is wrong, or is there a way for me to create the classes to return the JSON they are expecting? In the example, I believe the room type "Fenway Room" is a variable - so I don't think it can also be a class name. But it may just be that I don't know how to create a class like this. I just can't figure out the "Fenway Room" - which I think needs to have something like: "Room Name":"Fenway Room" - but maybe there is another way of defining the classes so that it doesn't need a label "Room Name". I'd appreciate any help in confirming if it is possible to create classes to match against their JSON. Thanks, Mark

@TITLE:Where does the constant 5 come from in the median-of-medians algorithm?
@CONTENT:I've been trying to understand where the "5" comes from in the Median of Medians algorithm, but can't seem to find a simple description of how it is derived and why it is optimal. For example, why isn't say 7 a viable option? The only advantage I can see for 5 is that it has 2 items on each side of the middle making a sort over the 5 items a simple case of no more than 3 swaps.

@TITLE:Where do you initialize property values in a View Controller?
@CONTENT:I have a view controller with properties that determine its behaviour. These are set by its parent in prepareForSegue. The potential bug this induces in my program is that the parent in question is not guaranteed to set the properties, so I would like to have a default value. On researching, I now understand that properties in Objective C don't have default values. This left me with the following options: Set the default values for properties in the child view's viewDidLoad method. However, on investigation, viewDidLoad is called after prepareForSegue in the parent - so I would be overwriting the parent's values when the parent actually does set the properties. I then thought I could use (id) init to initialize the values, but, at least when using storyboards, this method isn't called at all! I may have a workaround in that objects will initialize to a default value, but in this case all I want to pass in is a BOOL. And since the bool will have some value even if not initialized correctly, I can't test it to see if it is non-nil. Are there any opportunities for initializing value in the child view controller before prepareForSegue in the parent?

@TITLE:Syntax for specialization of nested template class
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out the correct syntax for explicit specialization of a nested template class. The following code will better illustrate: struct Column_Major;
struct Row_Major;

template<size_t rows, size_t cols, typename T, typename Allocator>
class Matrix
{

    /* bunch of members */
    template <typename storage = Column_Major>
    class Iterator
    {
        /* bunch of members */
    };
};
 I'd like to write an explicit specialization for template <> class Matrix<...>::Iterator<Row_Major, but the syntax is eluding me. I have a suspicion that it is not possible to explicitly specialize the Iterator class without an explicit specialization of the containing class, Matrix. But I would be very happy if there is a way to do this. I know I could make the Iterator class a separate class, not a member of the Matrix class, but having the classes nested as such allows me full access to the template parameters and datamebers of the Matrix class, which simplifies things. I know I could work around this if I need to, but I'd first like to investigate and understand the possibilities for the nested approach. Thanks, Shmuel

@TITLE:Python, Matplotlib, plot multi-lines (array) and animation
@CONTENT:I'm starting programming in Python (and OOP), but I have a solid experience in Fortran (90/95) and Matlab programming. I'm developing a little tool using animation on tkinter environment. The goal of this tool is to animate multi-lines (an array and not a vector of data). Below, a simple example of my problem. I don't understand why the result of these two ways of plotting data are so different ? from pylab import *

Nx=10
Ny=20

xx   = zeros( ( Nx,Ny) )
data = zeros( ( Nx,Ny) )

for ii in range(0,Nx):
    for jj in range(0,Ny):
        xx[ii,jj]   = ii
        data[ii,jj] = jj


dline = plot(xx,data)

mline, = plot([],[])
mline.set_data(xx.T,data.T)

show()
 If you plot only "dline" each line is plotted separately and with a different color. If you plot only "mline" all the lines are linked and with only one color. My goal is to make an animation with "mline" changing the data at each loop. Here a simple source code illustrating my purposes : from pylab import *
from matplotlib import animation

Nx=10
Ny=20

fig = plt.figure()
fig.set_dpi(100)
fig.set_size_inches(7, 6.5)

ax = plt.axes(xlim=(0, Nx), ylim=(0, Ny))

xx   = zeros( ( Nx,Ny) )
data = zeros( ( Nx,Ny) )
odata = zeros( ( Nx,Ny) )

for ii in range(0,Nx):
    for jj in range(0,Ny):
        xx[ii,jj]    = ii
        odata[ii,jj] = jj
        data[ii,jj]  = 0.

#dline = plot(xx,odata)

mline, = plot([],[])

def init():
    mline.set_data([],[])
    return mline,

def animate(coef):
   for ii in range(0,Nx):
        for jj in range(0,Ny):
            data[ii,jj] = odata[ii,jj] * (1.-float(coef)/360.)

   mline.set_data(xx.T,data.T)
   return mline,

anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, 
                               init_func=init, 
                               frames=360,

    bitset<8> set(binary_str);  
    cout << hex << set.to_ulong() << endl;
}
 It works great, but I need to store the output in a variable then return it to the function call rather than send it directly to standard out. I've tried to alter the code but keep running into errors. Is there a way to change the code to store the hex value in a variable? Or, if there's a better way to do this please let me know. Thank you.
@CODE:#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;
int main(){
    string binary_str("11001111");
    bitset<8> set(binary_str);  
    cout << hex << set.to_ulong() << endl;
} unsigned long std::string

@TITLE:Windows 8 - IE cannot reach sites listed in hosts file
@CONTENT:I have many local websites set up in IIS and have entries in my hosts file to make the websites available locally. I've come from a Windows 7 machine where everything was working correctly in all browsers. The move to Windows 8, using the same hosts file and the same websites in IIS seems to be causing issues with Internet Explorer (11). I can access the website: mywebsite.local in Firefox and Chrome but am unable to access the same website in Internet Explorer. I've made sure that I'm not connected via any proxies or VPN connections and that my hosts file entry is typed correctly yet Internet Explorer is still aborting the connection with the error: "This page can't be displayed". Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, Jon

@CONTENT:I have a Joomla site, and I have the following problem, I need a "Back to search page" function on my product details page, and I am using this code after some changes according to replies to my initian question: <br/><a href="" onclick="if (document.referrer.indexOf(window.location.host) !== -1) alert('true'); { history.go(-1); return false; } else { window.location.href = 'mysite.com.br'; }"><?php echo JText::_('VOLTAR'); ?></a>
 Now, if a Visitor comes from another site directly to my product page and click this, he will be redirected to homepage of my site, and this is ok, but if I in a search page of my site, click on a product page and then click on the back to search link, the visitor is also redirected to my homepage, which is not good, it should be redirected to previous page, which was his own search page. Is there any way to modify this code in order to accomplish something like: if visitor comes from my search page or from anywhere in my site, by clicking this he will be redirected to the previous page, and if a visitor came from outside of my site, by clicking this he will be redirected to my homepage?

@CONTENT:Should this work this way or am I doing something wrong? I have this code in my project source:   {$IFDEF DEBUG}

 I want ADebugUnit to be used when in debug mode but AReleaseUnit to be used when compiling in release mode. This works great EXCEPT when I select to add a new unit to the project. When I do that it will basically process the code and only keep the unit that pertains to whichever configuration the project is currently set to. For example, if the configuration is set to Debug then after adding a new unit to my project the above code changes to just: ADebugUnit,
 Or if my configuration is set to Release it will change to the following after adding a new unit: ARelaseUnit,
 I have to always restore it back to the conditional statements after adding a new unit. Is there a way to accomplish this without having the add new unit interfere?

@TITLE:How to Authenticate using MVC5RC/RTW with existing database
@CONTENT:I originally asked this question when Identity was in beta. The classes and interfaces have changed considerably since then and it appears the RTW version has some modifications again over the RC version. In principle I need to achieve the following. authenticate the local login against my usertable tblMembers which contains the userid field and password which are the two items I need to authenticate. have access to my tblMember record/class via the Controller.User property (Prior to MVC5 identity I had achieved this using the membership provider methods.) regardless of if the user logged in via the localuser method or via one of the other OAuth providers (Twitter, Google etc). Ability to display my own custom username despite the login method. Local users login with a userid 1234567 and a password, ideally I would like to display "John Smith (1234567)" regardless of the authentication method (local/Twitter etc) Initially I'm unsure as to what my memberclass should be inheriting from It appears from the aspIdentitySample project that I should be using IdentityUser?         public partial class tblMember

            public string password { get; set; }

@LINK:/questions/19321146/how-to-assign-roles-on-successful-registration
@TITLE:How to assign roles on successful registration?
@CONTENT:I'm using fos user bundle and pugx multi user bundle. I've read all the documentation and I'm new to Symfony. In the pugx multi user bundle there's a sample on every point but one: sucessful registration. Samples of overriding controllers for generating forms => ok Samples of overriding templates for generating forms => ok Samples of overriding successful registration sample => nothing. Here's my code: class RegistrationController extends BaseController
{
    public function registerAction(Request $request)
    {   
        $response = parent::registerAction($request);
        return $response;
    }   

    public function registerTeacherAction()
    {   
        return $this->container
            ->get('pugx_multi_user.registration_manager')
            ->register('MyBundle\Entity\PersonTeacher');
    }   

    public function registerStudentAction()
    {   
        return $this->container
            ->get('pugx_multi_user.registration_manager')
            ->register('MyBundle\Entity\PersonStudent');
    }   
}
 The problem is with ->get('pugx_multi_user.registration_manager') which returns a manager. In the fos user overring controllers help, they get either a form or a form.handler. I'm having hard times to "link" those with the pugx_multi_user manager. What code should I put in the registerTeacherAction() to set roles for teacher, and in registerStudentAction() to set roles for student on a successful registration?
@CODE:class RegistrationController extends BaseController
{
    public function registerAction(Request $request)
    {   
        $response = parent::registerAction($request);

@TITLE:What happens if an exception occurs in Catch block in C#. Also what would be the caller result in that case
@CONTENT:It was an interview question, quite simple, but I am not confident about the answer. What happens if an exception occurs in catch block ? I am trying to give an example small prog of what the interviewer was trying to ask me, please correct my program if it is not compiling, I am really new to this. Bottom line is what happens if an exception occurs in Catch and what will be the value of caller int hat case. For instance, I have the following: double Calculate(int x)
{
    try
    {
        x = x/2;
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        Console.Writeline("Message: "+ ex.Message);
    }
    finally
    {
      x = 10;
    }
    return x;
}

double myResult = Calculate(x); //x can be any number or 0 for example
 Now there are two questions: What happens if an exception happens in catch block ? Also, how to resolve it ? (This is simple example of what the interviewer was asking a similar question). What will happen to myResult if an exception happens in Calculate(x) method ?What will be its value in all cases ? (Please explain every case with an example) I would like to understand this with a detailed explanation too. Thank you so much.
@CODE:double Calculate(int x)
{
    try
    {
        x = x/2;
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        Console.Writeline("Message: "+ ex.Message);
    }
    finally
    {
      x = 10;
    }
    return x;
}

@LINK:/questions/19282074/fixed-float-view-in-uiscrollview-with-autolayout
@TITLE:Fixed / Float view in UIScrollView with AutoLayout
@CONTENT:In this technical Note Apple states that you can make a subview of UIScrollView fixed / floating by adding constraints to UISCrollView's superview. I tried that but I'm doing something wrong and I can't figure out whats the problem. Note that you can make a subview of the scroll view appear to float (not scroll) over the other scrolling content by creating constraints between the view and a view outside the scroll view・s subtree, such as the scroll view・s superview. That's what I did. I have a UIScrollView already set up and try to add the fixed view to the top of the scrollview like the following: _testOverlay = [[UIView alloc] init];
_testOverlay.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];
_testOverlay.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
[self.scrollView addSubview:_testOverlay];

[self.view addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"|[_testOverlay]|" options:0 metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(_testOverlay)]];
[self.view addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"V:|[_testOverlay(64)]-(>=0)-|" options:0 metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(_testOverlay)]];
 However, this does not work, the added view will move along with the scrollview and does not 'float'. Any ideas whats wrong here?
@CODE:_testOverlay = [[UIView alloc] init];
_testOverlay.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];
_testOverlay.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
[self.scrollView addSubview:_testOverlay];

[self.view addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"|[_testOverlay]|" options:0 metrics:nil views:NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(_testOverlay)]];

 Here is my code... This is the main controller that is calling the DAO Controller public function clickThroughAction(request $request, $hash)
    {
        if (isset($hash)) {
            $dbController = $this->get('database_controller');

        }
    }
 This is the service that is being used. services:
    database_controller:
        class:  Fuel\FormBundle\Controller\DatabaseController
 This is the dao controller that is calling the database. public function getReferralIdByHash($hash)
    {
        $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
        $query = $em->createQuery(
            'Select u From FuelFormBundle:UserReferrals u WHERE u.user_hash = :hash'

        $referral[0]->setClickThrough($clickThroughCount + 1);
        $em->flush();
        return $referral;
    }
 I think the problem is that the doctrine container is not present which is why I am having issues. I am not sure how to solve this. Any help is appreciated. Thanks! Edit Ok so here is what I changed. Main Controller stayed the same. DAO Controller a couple of things were added. class DatabaseController extends Controller{
    protected  $entityManager;

    public function __construct($entityManager) {
        $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
    }
public function getReferralIdByHash($hash)
    {
        $em = $this->entityManager;
        $query = $em->createQuery(
            'Select u From FuelFormBundle:UserReferrals u WHERE u.user_hash = :hash'
        )->setParameter('hash', $hash);

        $referral = $query->getResult();

        if (!$referral) {
            throw $this->createNotFoundException(
                'No product referral found'
            );
            $logger = $this->get('logger');
            $logger->info('I just got the logger');
            $logger->crit('An error occurred, hash for referrals is not recognized. current hash is: ' . $hash . " .");
            return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('home'));
        }

        $clickThroughCount = $referral[0]->getClickThrough();
        $referral[0]->setClickThrough($clickThroughCount + 1);
        $em->flush();
        return $referral;
    }
}

@TITLE:How do I retrieve UITableView row number of a UISwitch?
@CONTENT:I have tried several approaches posted here, but I cannot get my table full of switches to return an index value for the cell of the changed switch. I am creating the view containing the table programmatically (no xib). TableSandboxAppDelegate.m I instantiate the view controller in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: with: ...
TableSandboxViewController *sandboxViewController = [[TableSandboxViewController alloc]
    init];
[[self window] setRootViewController:sandboxViewController];
...
 TableViewController.h file reads: @interface TableSandboxViewController : UITableViewController
{
   NSMutableArray *_questionOrder;
   NSMutableArray *switchStates;
}
@end
 TableViewController.m cellForRowAtIndexPath: reads: UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@"MainCell"];

UISwitch *theSwitch = nil;

if (cell == nil) {
    cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault
        reuseIdentifier:@"MainCell"];

    theSwitch = [[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
    theSwitch.tag = 100;
    [theSwitch addTarget:self action:@selector(switchChanged:)   
        forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];
    [cell.contentView addSubview:theSwitch];

} else {
    theSwitch = [cell.contentView viewWithTag:100];
}

if ([[switchStates objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] isEqualToString:@"ON"]) {
    theSwitch.on = YES;
} else {
    theSwitch.on = NO;
}

return cell;
 TableViewController.m -(IBAction)switchChanged:(UISwitch *)sender reads: UITableViewCell *theParentCell = [[sender superview] superview];
NSIndexPath *indexPathOfSwitch = [self.tableView indexPathForCell:theParentCell];

NSLog(@"Switch changed at index: %d", indexPathOfSwitch.row);
 My log result is always "Switch changed at index: 0". I feel like the problem is in that CGPoint line where I've tried combinations of replacements for "sender" ([sender superview], [[sender superview]superview], etc). I don't feel like that line is pointing to the view that displays the table. What am I doing wrong? Note added 10/9, 9:15 EDT: my goal is to be able to handle about 100 yes/no questions in the table, so reuse is a key. I want to scroll and have the table the state of each switch, as well as be able to retrieve them when leaving the view.
@CODE:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: ...
TableSandboxViewController *sandboxViewController = [[TableSandboxViewController alloc]
    init];
[[self window] setRootViewController:sandboxViewController];
... @interface TableSandboxViewController : UITableViewController

@TITLE:How to delete all records associated with an ember model without clearing local Storage?
@CONTENT:I have extended the program given in this stackoverflow answer to have a program that deletes all the records all at once. However, the deletion happens only in batches and does not delete everything all at once. Here is a snippet of the function I am using in this JSBin. deleteAllOrg: function(){
  this.get('store').findAll('org').then(function(record){
    record.forEach(function(rec) {
        console.log("Deleting ", rec.get('id'));
        rec.deleteRecord();
        rec.save();
    });
    record.save();
  });
}
 Any idea how the program can be modified such that all records can be deleted at once? I have also tried model.destroy() and model.invoke('deleteRecords') but they don't work. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help!
@CODE:deleteAllOrg: function(){

@TITLE:Android webview cookie returns null
@CONTENT:I'm trying to simply set and retrieve a cookie inside a webview in android. I have tried numerous cookie manager scripts to try and get this to work. I have JavaScript enabled. When running the application on a Samsung S3 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 cookies don't appear to set at all (android 4.1). However, when running the software on a Samsung Galaxy ace, HTC Desire Z and in the android emulators, the cookies are set and read perfectly fine. When working, the webview returns the string as expected, when not working, the output is simply "null"; the cookie has not value/is not set. My specific case also uses sliding Navigation class, which is an extension of Actionbar Sherlock. I'd really appreciate any help, I've been struggling with this for several weeks now. Thank you.

@TITLE:Fragment on Screen Rotation
@CONTENT:I have added a viewpager to an activity which contains two page. In onCreate of activity I add fragments to a fragmentAdapter: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    ......

    FragmentAdapter fragmentAdapter = new FragmentAdapter
    (
        getSupportFragmentManager(),
        new Fragment[]{FragmentGame.builder(id), FragmentComments.builder(id)},

    // fragmentGame.id = id;

    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putLong(Constants.EXTRA_ID, id);
    fragmentGame.setArguments(bundle);

    return fragmentGame;
}
 First time that activity is created the onCreateView of fragment is called as it's expected. The strange behaviour is when the screen is rotated for the first time the onCreateView of fragment is called twice but the second call only has the correct id and for the first call id is 0. On second screen rotation, onCreateView is called three times and again only the last one has id. By more screen rotation, onCreateView calls increase. I found some related question about fragment and screen rotation but I can't figure out why this happens and how to do it the right way. ----- UPDATE ------ The ID problem is solved as I replaced bundle with direct value setting.
@CODE:public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)

Type listType = new TypeToken<List<MyModel>>(){}.getType();
List<MyModel> myModelList = gson.fromJson(jsonArray, listType);
 Unfortunately it complaints at the last line that the method fromJson(String, Type) in the type Gson is not applicable for the arguments (JSONArray, Type). I don't really know how to solve this. Does anybody know how I can solve this?

@CONTENT:If I use Oracle there is the connect by keyword which can be used to create hierarchical queries. Currently I'm using MySQL on a project and I would like to know whether there is an alternative for connect by in MySQL? I tried google but for no avail so far. What I'm trying to achieve is to fetch a tree from the database with one query. There are two tables involved: areas and area_to_parent_join. The latter contains two ids one is area_id and the other is parent_id. So it is basically a self-join and I can create graphs using that model. In fact it is currently only used to create trees but this might change in the future. But in either case what I would like to have is just a spanning tree. Edit: areas might have more than 1.000.000 records which makes most of the space-intensive options unfeasible.

@TITLE:Get Image using jQuery.ajax() and decode it to base64
@CONTENT:What i want to do: HTTP-GET an image (jpeg) using jQuery.ajax() from a basic-auth secured server. it seems like i get some data of the image, it must be binary. i want to convert that to base64, because then i can insert this as an image in my html this way:      $("#image").attr('src', 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + base64encode(data));
 the ajax call looks like this:             $.ajax({
                url: "someurltoajpeg",
                type: "GET",

                    "Authorization" : "Basic " +  btoa("user:pw")
                },
                xhrFields: {
                    withCredentials: true
                }
            }).done(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {
                $("#image").attr('src', 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + base64encode(data));
            }).fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
                alert("fail: " + errorThrown);
            });
 the function base64encode looks like this:         function base64encode(binary) {
            return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(binary)));
        }
 i got this function from here: Retrieving binary file content using Javascript, base64 encode it and reverse-decode it using Python there he says that it works for him. but in my case the src attribute of my image is changed, and some very long data is inserted, but only the very small symbol for that an image should be there appears. i can save that "image", thats not even there, and when i open it, my image viewer says, that it is not a jpeg file. this is not an error caused by the specific image or by the same origin policy. has anyone a solution to this? thanks

@CONTENT:Ok I have a bit of a noob student question. So I'm familiar with the fact that stacks contain subroutine calls, and heaps contain variable length data structures, and global static variables are assigned to permanant memory locations. But how does it all work on a less theoretical level? Does the compiler just assume it's got an entire memory region to itself from address 0 to address infinity? And then just start assigning stuff? And where does it layout the instructions, stack, and heap? At the top of the memory region, end of memory region? And how does this then work with virtual memory? The virtual memory is transparent to the program? Sorry for a bajilion questions but I'm taking programming language structures and it keeps referring to these regions and I want to understand them on a more practical level. THANKS much in advance!

I saw something somewhere saying to delete the Iphone Simulator folder in application support, but no such folder seems to exist. What can I try to do? Update-- With some additional research, I found that Iphone Simultor is in the Xcode.app now, but I don't know what to delete. There are many files under the iPhone Simulator Folder. If I delete the actual app, it just doesnt open. Any ideas?? I dont even get an iphone on the screen, just a black window... Update 2: Even when I just go to open developer tools -> iphone simulator it still gives me just a black screen.... Update 3 I just re-installed X-code, and all works now! Strange....I have no idea what happened...But I thought I would let y'all know for others who have similar issues.

@TITLE:Remove extra icon at actionbar (when using ShareActionProvider and ActionBarSherlock)
@CONTENT:I'm using ActionBarSherlock in my project, and want to set a share button to post content at FB etc etc... I achieved that this way: Adding items to action bar (using ActionBarSherlock) As you may know, ShareActionProvider adds a second icon with the most used option for sharing. That means another app's icon is appearing in my action bar, and I want to prevent that behavior... I've seen 2 possible solutions for that, and unfortunately both didn't worked to me :/ The first attempt was, in my target class, to implement OnShareTargetSelectedListener and override onShareTargetSelected method (like here: ActionBarSherlock - Share Content icon issue). But the extra icon stays there... here is my code: @Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu)
{
    getSupportMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.share, menu);
    mShareActionProvider = (ShareActionProvider) menu.findItem(R.id.share).getActionProvider();
    Intent intent = getDefaultShareIntent();
    mShareActionProvider.setOnShareTargetSelectedListener(this);
    if(intent!=null)
        mShareActionProvider.setShareIntent(intent);
    return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
}

@Override
public boolean onShareTargetSelected(ShareActionProvider source,
                                     Intent intent) {
    this.startActivity(intent);
    // started activity ourself to prevent search history
    return true;
}
 The second attempt was to rewrite some classes from ActionBarSherlock, to prevent it from showing the extra icon (like here: How to hide the share action (which use most) icon near the share action provider?). But I got problems with this solution, as I couldn't import com.actionbarsherlock.widget.ActivityChooserModel from my custom classes (blocked to outer packages). Even copying this class to my package, it didn't worked (app crashes)... Looks like its a pretty usual thing to disable this extra icon, but I couldn't figure out why the solutions above didn't worked to me... Thanks in advance for any ideas and sugestions

@LINK:/questions/18997279/frame-doesnt-reflect-auto-layout-constraints-after-dismissing-modal-view-contro
@TITLE:Frame doesn't reflect auto layout constraints after dismissing modal view controller
@CONTENT:I'm using iOS 6, a paging UIScrollView, and pure auto layout. Summary: I created a view controller that scrolls pages of content. Some of the views are created and configured in storyboard, others programmatically. Here's the view hierarchy: - Main view (storyboard) 
  - UIScrollView (storyboard)
    - content view (programmatically)
      - subviews representing pages of content (programmatically)
 The constraints for the scroll view are configured in IB. Here's how I configured the constraints for the content view in code: - (void)viewDidLoad
{
   // ABPageScrollerContentView is a subclass of UIView; it overrides intrinsicContentSize; the size is calculated without referencing the scroll view's dimensions
   self.contentView = [[ABPageScrollerContentView alloc] init];
   self.contentView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
   [self.pageScrollerView addSubview:self.contentView];

   // configure constraints between scroll view and content view...
   UIView *contentView = self.contentView;
   NSDictionary *viewsDictionary = NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(contentView);

   [self.pageScrollerView addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"H:|[contentView]|" options:0 metrics:0 views:viewsDictionary]];
   [self.pageScrollerView addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"V:|[contentView]|" options:0 metrics:0 views:viewsDictionary]];

   // the content view's subviews are added/removed in the tilePages method (not shown); tilePages is called later in the view controller lifecycle...
}
 If the user taps an edit button, another view controller is presented modally using a segue in the storyboard. After the view controller is dismissed, the system appears to inexplicably modify the frame of the content view even though the constraints are unchanged. I dismiss the presented view controller in the following delegate method: - (void)didExitEditPageViewVC:(id)controller
{
   // update currently displayed page view from data model...

   // logged content view frame = (0, 0; 1020, 460)

   [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{

      // logged content view frame = (-170, 0; 1020, 460)
   }];
}
 I don't understand how the x component of the frame's origin changed from 0 to -170. The constraints are identical before and after dismissing the view controller. Here is the frame and the constraints right before calling the dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion: method: (lldb) po self.contentView
$0 = 0x1ede2b40 <AEBPageScrollerContentView: 0x1ede2b40; frame = (0 0; 1020 460); layer = <CALayer: 0x1edd6f00>>

(lldb) po self.pageScrollerView.constraints
$1 = 0x1ed076c0 <__NSArrayM 0x1ed076c0>(
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1ede2980 H:|-(0)-[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>,
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1eded480 H:[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>,
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1edecbc0 V:|-(0)-[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>,
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1ede1040 V:[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>
)
 Here is the frame and the constraints after the presenting view controller re-appears: contentView = <AEBPageScrollerContentView: 0x1ede2b40; frame = (-170 0; 1020 460); layer = <CALayer: 0x1edd6f00>>

self.pageScrollerView.constraints =
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1ede2980 H:|-(0)-[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1eded480 H:[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1edecbc0 V:|-(0)-[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1ede1040 V:[AEBPageScrollerContentView:0x1ede2b40]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x1edd3410 )>"
)
 Why did the content view's frame change unexpectedly? And why doesn't it match what is dictated by the constraints? A delayed call to hasAmbiguousLayout returns false surprisingly. No exceptions are thrown. The scroll view even scrolls, albeit the content view is partly off-screen. No where do I explicitly set the scroll view's content size; I leave that to the system. The content view has an intrinsic size (the content view's size appears to be fine; it's the content view's origin that is the problem). The scroll view's content offset is the same before and after dismissing the view controller. However, the displacement of the x component of the content view's origin is proportional to the content offset. The greater the content offset, the more negative the x component of the content view's origin is after the modal view controller is dismissed. And, at a content offset of "zero", the x component is zero. So if the modal view controller is presented while viewing the first page of content (when the content offset is "zero"), the content view's frame is correct upon dismissal of the view controller. The content-offset-of-zero case is the only circumstance in which the content view's frame correctly reflects its constraints. I have tried inserting calls to layoutIfNeeded in various places with no results. Any suggestions?

 In other words, is it best to work on a tuple directly or might it be beneficial to work with a generator. If it is possible to approach this problem using both methods, please state the benefits and disadvantages for both approaches. Also, if it might be wise to use the generator approach, how might such a solution look? Here's what I currently do: def f(data, l):
    t = tuple(data)
    for j in range(len(t)):
        print(t[j:j+l])

data = (x for x in (1,2,3,4,5))
f(data,3)
 UPDATE: Note that I've updated my function to take a second argument specifying the length of the window.
@CODE:g = (x for x in (1,2,3,97,98,99)) (1,2,3)
(2,3,97)
(3,97,98)
(97,98,99)
(98,99)
(99) t = tuple(g) def f(data, l):
    t = tuple(data)
    for j in range(len(t)):
        print(t[j:j+l])

data = (x for x in (1,2,3,4,5))
f(data,3)

@TITLE:CSS oval shape cut out from div
@CONTENT:The above image is what i'm trying to create but am having some difficulties with the oval shape. An explanation: The menu bar is a div with a slight linear gradient (dark grey to transparent lighter grey) The company logo image has a transparent bg and will sit 'ontop' of the menu bar The oval cutout will need to match the oval of the logo and have a transparent gap between that will show the background colour (this changes on each page, orange is just an example) I've tried and failed many times with a radial gradient - I was able to get a circle cut out but couldn't work out how to make it oval and then couldn't get the linear gradient to work. See code: .circle {
    height: 10em;
    background: radial-gradient(circle 50px at 50% 100%, transparent 50px, rgba(84, 82, 94, 0.8) 50px);
    background: -webkit-radial-gradient(50% 100%, circle, transparent 50px, rgba(84, 82, 94, 0.8) 50px);
}
 When the cutout shape and the gradient is sorted, the logo will be positioned over the top. Any suggestions or jsfiddle solutions would be appreciated, thanks! EDIT: jsfiddle here EDIT 2: Have solved the problem by changing the design slightly, thanks to those who replied. I wrote some jquery to solve this - when the coloured area scrolls out of view the oval border and header border will pick up the colour of the top section, instead of the transparency.
@CODE:.circle {
    height: 10em;
    background: radial-gradient(circle 50px at 50% 100%, transparent 50px, rgba(84, 82, 94, 0.8) 50px);

@TITLE:Why my PanelND factory throwing a KeyError?
@CONTENT:I'm using Pandas version 0.12.0 on Ubuntu 13.04. I'm trying to create a 5D panel object to contain some EEG data split by condition. How I'm chosing to structure my data: Let me begin by demonstrating my use of pandas.core.panelnd.creat_nd_panel_factory. Subject = panelnd.create_nd_panel_factory(
    klass_name='Subject',
    axis_orders=['setsize', 'location', 'vfield', 'channels', 'samples'],
    axis_slices={'labels': 'location',
            'items': 'vfield',
            'major_axis': 'major_axis',
            'minor_axis': 'minor_axis'},
    slicer=pd.Panel4D,
    axis_aliases={'ss': 'setsize',
            'loc': 'location',
            'vf': 'vfield',
            'major': 'major_axis',
            'minor': 'minor_axis'}
    # stat_axis=2  # dafuq is this?
    )
 Essentially, the organization is as follows: setsize: an experimental condition, can be 1 or 2 location: an experimental condition, can be "same", "diff" or None vfield: an experimental condition, can be "lvf" or "rvf" The last two axes correspond to a DataFrame's major_axis and minor_axis. They have been renamed for clarity: channels: columns, the EEG channels (129 of them) samples: rows, the individual samples. samples can be though of as a time axis. What I'm trying to do: Each experimental condition (subject x setsize x location x vfield) is stored in it's own tab-delimited file, which I am reading in with pandas.read_table, obtaining a DataFrame object. I want to create one 5-dimensional panel (i.e. Subject) for each subject, which will contain all experimental conditions (i.e. DataFrames) for that subject. To start, I'm building a nested dictionary for each subject/Subject: # ... do some boring stuff to get the text files, etc...
for _, factors in df.iterrows():
    # `factors` is a 4-tuple containing
    #  (subject number, setsize, location, vfield, 
    #  and path to the tab-delimited file).
    sn, ss, loc, vf, path = factors
    eeg = pd.read_table(path, sep='\t', names=range(1, 129) + ['ref'], header=None)

    # build nested dict
    subjects.setdefault(sn, {}).setdefault(ss, {}).setdefault(loc, {})[vf] = eeg

# and now attempt to build `Subject`
for sn, d in subjects.iteritems():

@TITLE:XMLHttpRequest cannot load URL. Origin not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
@CONTENT:I want to make a small website that uses xml data from another domain. (Weather data from Weather Underground: www.wunderground.com). I am using just html and javascript, and writing it all in Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web. I make and send the xml request as follows: url = "http://api.wunderground.com/api/3c6e3d838e217361/geolookup/conditions/forecast/q/51.11999893,-114.01999664.xml";

xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlhttp.open("GET", url, false);
xmlhttp.send();
xmlDoc = xmlhttp.responseXML;
 The problem is that I get the following error in the Google Chrome (version 29.0.1547.66) developer console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api.wunderground.com/api/3c6e3d838e217361/geolookup/conditions/forecast/q/51.11999893,-114.01999664.xml. Origin http://localhost:49933 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. 
 Or this on Internet Explorer (version 10.0.8) console: SEC7118: XMLHttpRequest for http://api.wunderground.com/api/3c6e3d838e217361/geolookup/conditions/forecast/q/51.11999893,-114.01999664.xml required Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). 
 As I understand it, CORS (http://enable-cors.org/) needs effort by both the client and the server to work. I want to assume that the Weather Underground API knows what it is doing and has enabled things appropriately, such as setting the response header to include 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *', and I know that I get the same problems when I try the same code using another API provider (World Weather Online). So I think this is something I should be able to fix in my client code. Another SO answer where the suggestion is to fix the server-side header: CORS with XMLHttpRequest I have tried to find answers, but don't understand articles such as: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/dom-access-control-using-cross-origin-resource-sharing/ http://saltybeagle.com/2009/09/cross-origin-resource-sharing-demo/

@TITLE:Multiple Windows using window.open()
@CONTENT:So as we all know if you click on a submit button that has embedded in it a "onClick(windown.open(...))" this opens a new window with all the lovely attributes you specify. However if then proceed to click on teh parent window and again click on the 'submit' button wihtout closing the previous popup window, then that same window is overwritten with the new data. Now I need a way for that "window.open()" script to create new windows everytime it is clicked. SO in theory I could click the parent "submit" button 2 consecutive times and have 2 different child windows appear. I'm sure it's trivial but I can't seem to find anything. thanks in advance, nancy

@TITLE:Bypass HTML ：required； attribute when submitting [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Required attribute HTML5 8 answers I use required for a 1st check before submitting a form. <form action="myform.php">
  Foo: <input type="text" name="someField" required="required">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
  <input type="submit" value="ignore">
</form>
 Problem is, that I have an "ignore" button, which submits the form as well and the backend logic then sets a correct state in a DB. In this case (ignore) the validation is not desired (because there is no need to fill in field "Foo"). What's the best way to handle the 2 scenarios? I am aware that I could give up "required" and do the validation somewhere else (backend / JavaScript). I am looking for a way to keep the "required". I could use some Js onclick for the ignore button scenario and remove the attribute just before sending the form ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/13951500/356726 ). But actually I am looking for something smarter .... --- Edit --- Yes, duplicate of Required attribute HTML5

 The weird thing is that I can run this app on my emulator (API 16) and it runs just great but when I try to run it on a physical device (API 15), it gets this error. The AsyncTask is run in separate class, so it might cause this problem. I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks in advance.

@CONTENT:This question directly relates to this one. But I tried to break it down to the base problem and I didn't want to enter even more text into the other question box. So here goes: I know that I can include classmethods by extending the module ClassMethods and including it via the Module#include hook. But can I do the same with prepend? Here is my example: class Foo: class Foo
  def self.bar
    'Base Bar!'
  end
end 
 class Extensions: module Extensions
  module ClassMethods
    def bar
      'Extended Bar!'
    end
  end

  def self.prepended(base)
    base.extend(ClassMethods)
  end
end
# prepend the extension 
Foo.send(:prepend, Extensions)
 class FooE: require './Foo'

class FooE < Foo
end
 and a simple startscript: require 'pry'
require './FooE'
require './Extensions'

puts FooE.bar
 When I start the script I don't get Extended Bar! like I expect but rather Base Bar!. What do I need to change in order to work properly?
@CODE:class Foo
  def self.bar
    'Base Bar!'
  end
end module Extensions
  module ClassMethods
    def bar
      'Extended Bar!'

@TITLE:Rails JSON API testing POST request with PARAMS in JSON
@CONTENT:This is a problem that has been bothering me for some time. I am building an API function that should receive data in json and response in json. My controller tests run fine(Since I abstract that the data gets there already decode from JSON and only the answer needs to be interpreted ). I Also know that the function runs fine since I have used curl to test it with JSON arguments and it works perfectly. (ex: curl -i --header "Accept: application/json" --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test":{"email":"andreo@benjamin.dk"}}' ) But obviously I would like to write request(feature) tests to test this automatically and the way I see it they should work exactly like curl, i.e., hit my service like it was an external call. That means that I would like to pass the arguments in JSON and receive an answer. I am pretty lost since all the examples I can see people treat arguments as it was already decoded. My question is: I am following a wrong premise in wanting to send the arguments and request as a JSON one since i will be testing that rails works, because this is its responsibility? But I would like to see how robust my code his to wrong arguments and would like to try with JSON. something of this type: it "should return an error if there is no correct email" do
    params = {:subscription => {:email => "andre"}}

    post "/magazine_subscriptions", { 'HTTP_ACCEPT' => "application/json", 'Content-Type' => 'application/json', 'RAW_POST_DATA' => params.to_json }
end
 Do you know how this is possible? and please let me know if you think I am testing it wrong. all the best, Andre

@TITLE:Conditional coloring of cells in table
@CONTENT:I am trying to create a data table whose cells are different colors based on the value in the cell. I can achieve this with the function addtable2plot from the plotrix package. The addtable2plot function lays a table on an already existing plot. The problem with that solution is that I don't want a plot, just the table. I've also looked at the heatmap functions. The problem there is that some of the values in my table are character, and the heatmap functions, from what I can tell, only accept numeric matrices. Also, I want my column names to be at the top of the table, not the bottom, and that doesn't seem to be an option. Here's the example code for addtable2plot. If I could get just the table, filling the whole screen, that would be great. library(plotrix)

testdf<-data.frame(Before=c(10,7,5,9),During=c(8,6,2,5),After=c(5,3,4,3))

 It works fine and excludes the letters that I don't want the user to enter except the square bracket and the caret symbols.

I have searched here and on google for an explanation as to why these characters are also accepted but can't find an explanation. So can anyone help, why does my input accept the square brackets and the caret?

@TITLE:500 Internal Server Error requesting any resource files (css, js, images) in an .Net MVC 3 site
@CONTENT:UPDATE: Things I tried - see answer below for solution I installed a fresh MVC3 site and it served up the resources properly. That eliminated the machine.config settings as a problem. I then when section by section in the web.config to see if any particular changes in web.config caused the problem. When the configs were identical, the fresh site still worked and the old site was still broken. I uninstalled IIS, reinstalled IIS, and then installed apps again in an attempt to clear any settings that were lingering around. Still borked. I then used publish (instead of msi deploy) to new directory. I used the iis option to "Create Application" on new directory of exact same code that is broken. Things worked perfectly. I assumed file permissions, so I deleted offending directory and renamed new working version to old directory name. Site was still borked. This made me assume that some iis setting that is not in the machine.config or web.config is to blame. I used IIS 6 Metabase explorer (yes I used it on IIS 8 site) and saw quite a few entries that were not in the working site. After deleting one by one, I found it was the "scriptMaps" entry that was being added during our MSI install causing a problem. This was added to automatically add wildcard mappings during install. It works on IIS6, but apparently not on IIS8. We have an webforms and MVC3 application that look like one application. This is deployed in many environments (2003, 2008, Win 7) and works properly. I have just set these applications up on a new Windows Server 2012 machine and everything works except getting resource files for the MVC site. The browser gets a 500 Internal Server Error

@TITLE:Line interpolation in Qt?
@CONTENT:I am trying to decrease the spacing of my brush strokes (on a QPixmap) by dividing the length of the line. If I multiply the line then the spacing increases, but the spacing never decreases. Also it appears the minimum length the line can have is one. Obviously dividing it will decrease that - possibly below the allowed amount? Not sure if that'd affect the drawing of the pixmap negatively or not. Here is the offending code: QLineF line = QLineF(lastPoint, endPoint);
float lineLength = line.length();
qDebug() << line.length();
line.setLength(lineLength / 50.0f);

@TITLE:Does iOS keychain storage persist when restoring an app to a new device?
@CONTENT:My question is directly related to this one but is different: iOS: keychain on new devices or on restores. The poster is curious if you store information in keychain storage, does it get backed up to iTunes and iCloud so that when you restore it to another device the data are persisted. A partial answer to the OP's own question was: But now I read that the keychain is only restored if the backup is encrypted in iTunes (don't know about iCloud backups). The accepted answer was: You can transfer data using the iCloud, but this is NOT really secure! Save this data ENCRYPTED on your server and let the app read this data would be a solution. Btw. you shouldn't save sensible data unencrypted in the keychain. The keychain can be read really easy after jailbreak. Is whether the backup is encrypted or not determined by the developer's access to encrypt the data in code or by how the iTunes or iCloud user handles their backups? The answer to this is very important to me because I am trying to set an initial launch date of an app that determines how long before they have to resubscribe with in-app subscriptions. This piece of information must be shared between old and new devices and also remain on a single device even if the app is removed for a time period.

@LINK:/questions/18462064/associate-a-private-key-with-the-x509certificate2-class-in-net
@TITLE:Associate a private key with the X509Certificate2 class in .net
@CONTENT:I'm working on some code that creates a X509certificate and a public/private key pair. The public key is added to the certificate and it is sent to an CA which signs it. The returned certificate is then accessed through the System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 class. Now I want to use this certificate to initiate a secure connection with other clients. Therefore I use the SslStream class. To start the SSL Handshake I use this method: server.AssociatedSslStream.AuthenticateAsServer(
                        MyCertificate,                      // Client Certificate
                        true,                               // Require Certificate from connecting Peer
                        SslProtocols.Tls,                   // Use TLS 1.0
                        false                               // check Certificate revocation
                    );
 This method requires that the private key is associated with the certificate. Of course the certificate returned by the CA does not contain a private key. But it is stored as .key file on the harddrive. The X509Certificate2 class has a property called PrivateKey which I guess will associate a private key with the certificate, but I can't find a way to set this property. Is there any way I can associate the private key with the .net X509 class?
@CODE:server.AssociatedSslStream.AuthenticateAsServer(
                        MyCertificate,                      // Client Certificate

@TITLE:PhoneGap App rejected 10.6
@CONTENT:Our PhoneGap App just got rejected. Binary Rejected: 10.6: Apple and our customers place a high value on simple, refined, creative, well thought through interfaces. They take more work but are worth it. Apple sets a high bar. If your user interface is complex or less than very good it may be rejected Text: "We found the following issues with the user interface of your app: Did not include iOS features. For example, it would be appropriate to use native iOS buttons and iOS features other than just web views, Push Notifications, or sharing. Specifically, we noticed the app provides a consumption of information with limited ways users can interact with that information. It would be appropriate to add iOS specific UI and functionality rather than displaying just text and table views." On above they are first referring to the interface and the look and next they are reffering to just the content/function and that the app just provides informations. The Interface is clean and simple. It is an application that provides (premium) informations. There are several apps in app store who work like this. I heard about including some plugin or API so that I can justify the App. But there would be no sense in this app for the use of an plugin. Or has someone an Idea to provide fake functions? Would be sad if we couldn't release this app, we put a lot of time and effort in this app. Has anyone tips on how to submit an information-based application?

@TITLE:Reading json input in php
@CONTENT:php://input is working properly in localhost. But in server it returns empty. Input( request ) to my site is a json(REST - application/json type), so $_POST didn't work ( please read This question ) . $_POST works with key-value pair type inputs like form-data or x-www-urlencoded key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3 I'm using application/json as input (in REST). Like {'key1':'value1','key2':'value2','key3':'value3'} This can't be handled using $_POST. But using php://input can help to read that data. My code class Webservice_Controller extends CI_Controller {
    public $json_input_data;
    public function __construct(){
        parent::__construct();
        $this->json_input_data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'),TRUE);

        if(isset($this->json_input_data[$label])) return $this->json_input_data[$label];
        else return NULL;
    }
}
 Above code is works fine in another webserver also, But not in the current one. :( I think my web server deny access to php://input. Is there is any other methods to read json input in php ?

@TITLE:Future.wait() can't wait without a fiber (while waiting on another future in Meteor.method)
@CONTENT:In Meteor, I'm writing a method that will have to check a certain path's subdirectories for new files. I first would like to just list the subdirectories within Meteor after which I child_process.exec a simple bash script that lists files added since the last time it executed. I'm having some issues getting the directory discovery to be async (Error: Can't wait without a fiber). I've written a synchronous version but having both fs.readdir and fs.stat in stead of their synchronous alternatives allows me to catch errors. Here's the code: function listDirs(dir, isDir){

    var future1 = new Future();fs.readdir(dir, function(err, files){

            if (err)
                throw new Meteor.error(500, "Error listing files", err);

            var dirs = _.map(files, function(file){

                var future2 = new Future();
                var resolve2 = future2.resolver();

                fs.stat(dir+file, function(err, stats){

                    if (err)
                        throw new Meteor.error(500, "Error statting files", err);

                    if (stats.isDirectory() == isDir && file.charAt(0) !== '.')
                        resolve2(err, file);

                });

                return future2;

            });

            Future.wait(dirs);

            //var result = _.invoke(dirs, 'get');

            future1['return'](_.compact(dirs));
        });

        return future1.wait();
    }
 The error Error: Can't wait without a fiber has to do with future2. When I comment out Future.wait(dirs) the server doesn't crash anymore, but that's about as far as I got in trying to solve this. :/ Another _.map function I use in another part of the method works fine with futures. (see also https://gist.github.com/possibilities/3443021 where I found my inspiration)
@CODE:Meteor Meteor child_process.exec Error: Can't wait without a fiber fs.readdir fs.stat function listDirs(dir, isDir){

    var future1 = new Future();fs.readdir(dir, function(err, files){

            if (err)
                throw new Meteor.error(500, "Error listing files", err);

            var dirs = _.map(files, function(file){

                var future2 = new Future();
                var resolve2 = future2.resolver();

                fs.stat(dir+file, function(err, stats){

                    if (err)
                        throw new Meteor.error(500, "Error statting files", err);

                    if (stats.isDirectory() == isDir && file.charAt(0) !== '.')
                        resolve2(err, file);

                });

                return future2;

            });

            Future.wait(dirs);

            //var result = _.invoke(dirs, 'get');

            future1['return'](_.compact(dirs));
        });

@QREC:18328492
@LINK:/questions/18328492/resttemplate-jackson
@TITLE:RestTemplate + Jackson
@CONTENT:I want to use Spring's RestTemplate plus Jackson to consume a WebService. I have followed several tutorials and have come to the point of creating the DAOs. This is the method where I get all of my domain objects: // Create a Rest template
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

// Create a list for the message converters

List<HttpMessageConverter<?>> messageConverters = new ArrayList<HttpMessageConverter<?>>();

// Add the Jackson Message converter
messageConverters.add(new MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter());

// Add the message converters to the restTemplate
restTemplate.setMessageConverters(messageConverters);

List<Station> resultList = Arrays.asList(restTemplate.getForObject(BASE_URL, Station[].class));

return resultList;
 But my Web Service does not return an array of Station objects right away, but rather a more semantic expression in this way: {"success":true,"message":"Records Retrieved Successfully","data":{"totalCount":"14","stations":[{"id":"1264","station":"Station 1","idJefatura":"1","syncDate":"2013-01-24 13:20:43"}, ...] }}
 So my problem is, I'm not sure how to "tell" RestTemplate to parse the object list right after the "stations" indicator, without creating an ad hoc object, which does not seem like the proper solution. Is there any way to specify the right syntax for RestTemplate? EDIT: I created a wrapper object like this: public class RestResponseObject {

    private boolean success;
    private String message;
    private Data data;

    public Data getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setData(Data data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public boolean isSuccess() {
        return success;
    }

    public void setSuccess(boolean success) {
        this.success = success;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public class Data {
        private int totalCount;
        private List<Station> stations;

        public int getTotalCount() {
            return totalCount;
        }

        public void setTotalCount(int totalCount) {
            this.totalCount = totalCount;
        }

        public List<Station> getStations() {
            return stations;
        }

        public void setStations(List<Station> estaciones) {
            this.stations= estaciones;
        }
    }
}
 But I am struggling as to how to make this object generic, since the key name of my object list in the JSON response is dependant of that domain object's class.
@CODE:// Create a Rest template
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

// Create a list for the message converters

List<HttpMessageConverter<?>> messageConverters = new ArrayList<HttpMessageConverter<?>>();

// Add the Jackson Message converter
messageConverters.add(new MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter());

// Add the message converters to the restTemplate
restTemplate.setMessageConverters(messageConverters);

List<Station> resultList = Arrays.asList(restTemplate.getForObject(BASE_URL, Station[].class));

return resultList; {"success":true,"message":"Records Retrieved Successfully","data":{"totalCount":"14","stations":[{"id":"1264","station":"Station 1","idJefatura":"1","syncDate":"2013-01-24 13:20:43"}, ...] }} public class RestResponseObject {

    private boolean success;
    private String message;
    private Data data;

    public Data getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setData(Data data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public boolean isSuccess() {
        return success;

        this.success = success;

I later removed the codes that sets the local notifications, and added push notification feature. I test the push and it works (whenever I want to).

I decided to use Grid class (QWidget is parent) as a container and my own clas inherited from QWidget as elements. Now I'm trying to learn how to perform a drag & drop for QWidget, but it seems like you are only able to drop onto a QWidget, but it's impossible to drag it. Is it true or just I'm being retard? How do I move this thing? x.x

@TITLE:Check whether an object with property value 'x' exists in an array in Javascript
@CONTENT:I have a lot of objects that I'm trying to filter out duplicates from. When an object has a property, IMAGEURL which is present in another object, I want to ignore this object and move on. I'm using nodeJS for this so if there's a library I can use to make it easier let me know. I've done similar implementations before with checking string values in arrays, doing something like: var arr = ['foo', 'bar'];
if(arr.indexOf('foo') == -1){
   arr.push('foo')
}
 But this won't work for objects, as best I can tell. What are my options here? To put it more simply: var obj1 = {IMAGEURL: 'http://whatever.com/1'};
var obj2 = {IMAGEURL: 'http://whatever.com/2'};
var obj3 = {IMAGEURL: 'http://whatever.com/1'};

var arr = [obj1, obj2, obj3];
var uniqueArr = [];

for (var i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
    // For all the iterations of 'uniqueArr', if uniqueArr[interation].IMAGEURL == arr[i].IMAGEURL, don't add arr[i] to uniqueArr
}
 How can I do this?
@CODE:IMAGEURL nodeJS var arr = ['foo', 'bar'];
if(arr.indexOf('foo') == -1){
   arr.push('foo')
} var obj1 = {IMAGEURL: 'http://whatever.com/1'};

@LINK:/questions/18274986/async-catch-doesnt-work-on-operationcanceledexceptions
@TITLE:Async.Catch doesnt work on OperationCanceledExceptions
@CONTENT:I use Async.Catch to handle exceptions thrown by async workflows: work
|> Async.Catch
|> Async.RunSynchronously
|> fun x -> match x with
            | Choice1Of2 _ -> () // success
            | Choice2Of2 ex -> // failure, handle exception
 Today I noticed that OperationCanceledExceptions aren't handled by Async.Catch. Instead of getting a Choice from Async.Catch the exception keeps bubbling up until it hits me. I expected the following test to be red, but it's green:   [<Test>]
  let ``Async.Catch doesnt work on OperationCancelledExceptions``() =
    use cancellationTokenSource = new System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource(1000)

    let work = async {
      while true do
        do! Async.Sleep 100
    }

    (fun () -> work
               |> Async.Catch
               |> fun x -> Async.RunSynchronously (x, cancellationToken=cancellationTokenSource.Token)
               |> ignore)
    |> should throw typeof<System.OperationCanceledException>
 Evaluating some exceptions with Async.Catch + Choices + matching and some others using try/catch blocks doesn't seem right... it would look like the following, which is way too complicated. Besides that I wonder what use Async.Catch has, since I have to use a try/catch block anyway...:   [<Test>]
  let ``evaluating exceptions of async workflows``() =
    use cancellationTokenSource = new System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource(1000)

    let work = async {
      while true do
        do! Async.Sleep 100
    }

    try
      work
      |> Async.Catch
      |> fun x -> Async.RunSynchronously (x, cancellationToken=cancellationTokenSource.Token)
      |> fun x -> match x with
                  | Choice1Of2 result -> () // success, process result
                  | Choice2Of2 ex -> () // failure, handle exception
    with ex -> () // another failure, handle exception here too
 What's the best way to handle exceptions of async workflows? Should I just dump Async.Catch and use try/catch blocks everywhere?

@TITLE:Optimization techniques for select query on single table with ~2.25M rows?
@CONTENT:I have a MySQL table running on the InnoDB engine called squares that has roughly 2,250,000 rows with the following table structure: `squares` (
   `square_id` int(7) unsigned NOT NULL,
   `ref_coord_lat` double(8,6) NOT NULL,
   `ref_coord_long` double(9,6) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (`square_id`),
   KEY `ref_coord_lat` (`ref_coord_lat`),
   KEY `ref_coord_long` (`ref_coord_long`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
 The first column square_id holds a simple incrementing value from 0 - 2.25M, while ref_coord_lat & ref_coord_long hold a set of latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal degrees for a point, respectively. This is a read-only table. No additional rows will be added, and the only query which needs to be run against it is the following: SELECT * FROM `squares` WHERE 
  `ref_coord_lat` BETWEEN :southLat AND :northLat AND 
  `ref_coord_long` BETWEEN :westLong AND :eastLong
 ...where the values following the colons are PHP PDO placeholders. Essentially, the goal of this query is to fetch all coordinate points in the table that are currently in the viewport of a Google Maps window which is bounded by the 4 coordinates in the query. I've limited the zoom level where this query is run with the Google Maps API, so that the maximum amount of rows that can be fetched is ~5600. As the zoom level increases, the resultant fetch total decreases significantly. Running such an example query directly in PHPMyAdmin takes 1.40-1.45 seconds. This is far too long. I'm already running standard indices on ref_coord_lat and ref_coord_long which brought the query time down from ~5 seconds, but this is still much too large for a map where an end user expects a timely response. My question is simply: How can I further optimize this table/query to increase the speed at which results are fetched?

   `square_id` int(7) unsigned NOT NULL,

@TITLE:Jquery: Click event doesn't work after append. (Don't know how to use .ON)
@CONTENT:I have 2 click events. One appends an IMG which includes another click event. It doesn't work obviously. I know that I have to use jQuery's .ON, but I just can't figure out how and where. My code: $( document ).ready(function() {
    // The one below (.choimh) isn't triggered anymore
    $('.choimg').click(function(){

    });

    // Switch to chosen color
    $('.color').click(function(){
        $(".thumbs").append('<a href="#"><img id="image'+u+'" class="choimg" src="/img/products/mini/'+colnumber+'-'+ i + '.jpg" />');
    });
});
 The .color div is on a completely different place than .choimg. I just can't figure out how to use .ON.
@CODE:$( document ).ready(function() {
    // The one below (.choimh) isn't triggered anymore
    $('.choimg').click(function(){

    });

    // Switch to chosen color
    $('.color').click(function(){
        $(".thumbs").append('<a href="#"><img id="image'+u+'" class="choimg" src="/img/products/mini/'+colnumber+'-'+ i + '.jpg" />');
    });

@TITLE:How to order grouped results using Eloquent?
@CONTENT:I've been trying to figure this out for some time now and just can't seem to make it work. I have a table that looks similar to this. Table: Issues id  yearly_issue    year    stock   created_at      updated_at      magazine_id 
1   10              2000    1       [timestamp]     [timestamp]     3
2   12              1994    6       [timestamp]     [timestamp]     10
3   36              2007    10      [timestamp]     [timestamp]     102
4   6               2002    7       [timestamp]     [timestamp]     7
5   6               2002    2       [timestamp]     [timestamp]     5
6   12              2003    9       [timestamp]     [timestamp]     10
7   11              2003    12      [timestamp]     [timestamp]     10
 My problem is that I need to sort it (easy!) but, I only want to get one of each magazine (column magazine_id). My Eloquent query as of now is: $issues = Issue::where('stock', ($all ? '>=' : '>'), 0)
  ->orderBy('year', 'desc')
  ->orderBy('yearly_issue', 'desc')
  ->take($perpage)
  ->get();
 I thought adding the groupBy('magazine_id') would help, but it seems as though it only partially helps me. The results is not in the correct order. So, my question then is - is there any easy way around this? I've been experimenting with various answers to similar questions but I completely fail to implement it. Retrieving the last record in each group or How to get the latest record in each group using GROUP BY? More help would be much appreciated. EDIT: The closest I am currently is this: SELECT i1.*, c.name AS image, m.title AS title
FROM issues i1
INNER JOIN covers c ON i1.id = c.issue_id
INNER JOIN magazines m ON i1.magazine_id = m.id
JOIN (SELECT magazine_id, MAX(year) year, MAX(yearly_issue) yearly_issue FROM issues GROUP BY magazine_id) i2
ON i1.magazine_id = i2.magazine_id
AND i1.year = i2.year
-- AND i1.yearly_issue = i2.yearly_issue
WHERE i1.stock ($all ? '>=' : '>') 0
ORDER BY i1.year DESC, i1.yearly_issue DESC
LIMIT $perpage
 However, it is not giving me the desired result at all.
@CODE:id  yearly_issue    year    stock   created_at      updated_at      magazine_id 
1   10              2000    1       [timestamp]     [timestamp]     3

@TITLE:Adding keys to Nested NSDictionary
@CONTENT:I am having problems creating new keys for a Nested NSDictionary. Here's what I have done I have this kind of NSMutableDictionary   NSMutableDictionary *Ga=[NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:@{@"Node1" :@{@"SubNode11" :@40,@"SubNode12":@30}}];
 Which NSLogs as: Node1 =     {
    SubNode11 = 40;
    SubNode12 = 30;
};
 Now to add another root key and a nested key I did this, [Ga setObject:@{@"SubNode21" : @555} forKey:@"Node2"];
 Now the NSLog outputs: Node1 =     {
    SubNode11 = 40;
    SubNode12 = 30;
};
Node2 =     {
    SubNode21 = 555;
};
}
 I need to add another key to an existing Node, say SubNode22=345; for Node2 in a separate line of code, so I thought this might work [[Ga objectForKey:@"Node2"] setObject:@5555 forKey:@"SubNode22"];
 But this show Error "Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSDictionaryI setObject:forKey:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance" I don't what the Problem is,, this method seems straight forward to me.. Any solution please.
@CODE:NSMutableDictionary *Ga=[NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:@{@"Node1" :@{@"SubNode11" :@40,@"SubNode12":@30}}]; Node1 =     {

}; [Ga setObject:@{@"SubNode21" : @555} forKey:@"Node2"]; Node1 =     {
    SubNode11 = 40;
    SubNode12 = 30;

Node2 =     {
    SubNode21 = 555;
};

 Thx to the Log I found out that the error happens in NeuQuant::learn(), did some debugs and it crashes on this exact line b = (((*p)) & 0xff) << netbiasshift;. The Crash doesnt happen always, sometimes I get a gif and everything works, but sometimes it crashes at b = (((*p)) & 0xff) << netbiasshift;. I did some more debuging and I found out that when it crashes on b = (((*p)) & 0xff) << netbiasshift; it doesnt crash when it enters the first time, it crashes like after the 30 check of b = (((*p)) & 0xff) << netbiasshift;. Anyone know what might be the problem?

@TITLE:Is there a pure Promise-based approach for mapping/concatenating collections?
@CONTENT:async vs. Q generally I'm learning Node.js development, and trying to wrap my brain around strategies for managing asynchronous "callback hell". The two main strategies I've explored are Caolan McMahon's async module, and Kris Kowal's promise-based Q module. Like many other people, I'm still struggling to understand when you should use one vs. the other. However, generally speaking I have found promises and Q-based code to be slightly more intuitive, so I have been moving in that direction. Mapping/Concatenating collections generally However, I'm still stuck using the async module's functions for managing collections. Coming from a Java and Python background, most of the time when I work with a collection, the logic looks like this: Initialize a new empty collection, in which to store results. Perform a for-each loop with the old collection, applying some logic to each element and pushing its result into the new empty collection. When the for-each loop ends, proceed to use the new collection. In client-side JavaScript, I've grown accustomed to using jQuery's map() function... passing in that step #2 logic, and getting the step #3 result as a return value. Feels like the same basic approach. Mapping/Concatenating collections with async and Q The Node-side async module has similar map and concat functions, but they don't return the concatenated result back at the original scope level. You must instead descend into the callback hell to use the result. Example: var deferred = Q.defer();

...

var entries = [???]; // some array of objects with "id" attributes

async.concat(entries, function (entry, callback) {
    callback(null, entry.id);
}, function (err, ids) {
    // We now have the "ids" array, holding the "id" attributes of all items in the "entries" array.
    ...
    // Optionaly, perhaps do some sorting or other post-processing on "ids".
    ...
    deferred.resolve(ids);
});

...

return deferred.promise;
 Since my other functions are becoming promise-based, I have this code returning a promise object so it can be easily included in a then() chain. Do I really need both? The ultimate question that I'm struggling to articulate is: do I really need both async and Q in the code example above? I'm learning how to replace the async module's control flow with Q-style promise chains generally... but it hasn't yet "clicked" for me how to do mapping or concatenation of collections with a promise-based approach. Alternatively, I'd like to understand why you can't, or why it's not a good idea. If async and Q are meant to work together as I am using them in the example above, then so be it. But I would prefer not to require the extra library dependency if I could cleanly use Q alone. (Sorry if I'm missing something outrageously obvious. The asynchronous event-driven model is a very different world, and my head is still swimming.)
@CODE:var deferred = Q.defer();

...

var entries = [???]; // some array of objects with "id" attributes

async.concat(entries, function (entry, callback) {
    callback(null, entry.id);
}, function (err, ids) {
    // We now have the "ids" array, holding the "id" attributes of all items in the "entries" array.
    ...
    // Optionaly, perhaps do some sorting or other post-processing on "ids".
    ...
    deferred.resolve(ids);
});

...

return deferred.promise; then() callback async.concat

I would like to know why it is undefined in Windows phone 8 and not in Window phone 7 PhoneGap app. Also, I would like to know, is there any way to quit the app programmatically in Windows phone 8 PhoneGap app?.

@TITLE:With HTML5 url input validation assume url starts with http://
@CONTENT:HTML5 provides for automatic URL validation :- <form>
   <input type="url" name="someUrl">
</form>
 This will fail validation for URL's that don't have a protocol prefix - e.g. stackoverflow.com will fail while http://stackoverflow.com will pass. How can I automatically add http:// to a url if there isn't already a protocol? I could add a onblur event handler but is there a better way like some before validation event?

@LINK:/questions/17895888/save-arraylist-in-shared-preferences
@TITLE:Save ArrayList in shared preferences
@CONTENT:i am searching for hours to find out why saving boolean list in shared preferences is not working. The methods are not saving or loading something... the loadmethod always returns the alternative values: so list_size as 0 and the booleans as false. First of all i create the list in my MainActivity and call the save Method: SaveLoadTraining sLoad = new SaveLoadTraining();
    ArrayList<Boolean> listBoolTrain = new ArrayList<Boolean>();
    listBoolTrain.add(true);
    listBoolTrain.add(true);
    sLoad.saveArray(listBoolTrain);
 The subclass SaveLoadTraining looks like this:     package de.sebspr.app08.halle;

import java.util.ArrayList;

import android.content.Context;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import de.sebspr.app08.MainActivity;

public class SaveLoadTraining {

    private Context context;
    public static final String PREFS_NAME = "ListFile";
    private ArrayList<Boolean> list;

    public SaveLoadTraining(){
        this.context = MainActivity.getMContext();
    }

    public void saveArray(ArrayList<Boolean> list){

        this.list = list;

        SharedPreferences settings = context.getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, 0);
        SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit();

        int size = list.size();
        editor.putInt("list_size", size);

        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            editor.remove("list_"+i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            editor.putBoolean("list_"+i, list.get(i));
        }       
        editor.commit();
    }

    public ArrayList<Boolean> loadArray(){

        SharedPreferences file = context.getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, 0);
        list = new ArrayList<Boolean>();
        int size = file.getInt("list_size", 0);

        for(int i = 0; i<size;i++){
            boolean bool = file.getBoolean("list_"+i, false);
            list.add(bool);
        }
        return list;
    }
}
 I can not figure out what is going wrong... Perhaps i handle the context on a wrong way? I just call this method to get the context of the MainActivity: ...
mContext = this;
...
    public static Context getMContext(){
        return mContext;
    }

    }

    public void saveArray(ArrayList<Boolean> list){

        this.list = list;

        SharedPreferences settings = context.getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, 0);
        SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit();

        int size = list.size();
        editor.putInt("list_size", size);

        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            editor.remove("list_"+i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            editor.putBoolean("list_"+i, list.get(i));
        }       
        editor.commit();
    }

            boolean bool = file.getBoolean("list_"+i, false);
            list.add(bool);

@CONTENT:I heard that OS 4.3 has hidden feature to disable some permissions w/o repackaging APK. When we release app, we add necessary permissions and make app work. But that feature can disable permissions. I know some app have been doing this though it's a hack and I don't need to care. But with OS 4.3, user can easily can do this. Now my question is, when permission is disabled, does corresponding API throws exception? (I guess so.) If this is true, I should add try-catch for some operations otherwise novice user may end up thinking my app is poorly designed. Or, I will add some code to check permissions are there for my app to work and if not I will show some rude, no polite message to tell don't do this and quit app. (Someone may close this question saying this is not a true question.)

@CONTENT:I'm setting up a pretty simple conference call system, where the user enters a PIN and is connected to a conference associated with that. I'm also setting it up so they record their name before entering the room. My plan is to take the recording URL, then get the list of participants and make the REST API call to each caller modifying their call to to the Say "Now entering", then Play the recording url. I think I'm going to have to send them back into the room after that as well, I'm not sure. I think that modifying each call will take them out of the Conference room, which is not ideal. Is there an easier way to use Say/Play to all members of a conference built into the REST API?

@TITLE:WordPress jQuery Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
@CONTENT:I'm converting my html files to a WordPress theme and I'm using the plugin ZClip for copy text to clipboard. The ZClip plugin works fine in my html demo, but when converting to WordPress I got this weird syntax error "Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function" in line 288 in the zclip.js file which is $(this.domElement).data('zclipId', 'zclip-' + this.movieId);
 I think it is something with the variable $ not sure. I read something about the jQuery might get in conflict with each other in WP so I have changed my main.js file to jQuery(document).ready(function($){

    ...
    $("button").zclip({
      path:'js/ZeroClipboard.swf',
      copy: function() { return $(this).attr("data-coupon"); }
    });
});

function load_styles_and_scripts(){
    //load css
    wp_enqueue_style( 'main-styles', get_template_directory_uri().'/style.css' );

    // load scripts

    wp_enqueue_script( 'main-script', get_template_directory_uri().'/js/main.js' );

}

add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'load_styles_and_scripts');
 Finally figured this out after a full day, lol. Seems like the WP 3.5.2 load an older version of jQuery 1.8.3 and I using a new version and it it doesn't load because of this line wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery', 'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js' );
 maybe 'jquery' is reserved for WP's local jquery installation I changed it to and my site starts to work, but according to a user here it is not recommended. wp_enqueue_script( 'jq', 'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js' );
@CODE:$(this.domElement).data('zclipId', 'zclip-' + this.movieId); jQuery(document).ready(function($){

I'm sending some text resource to an activity that shows it... If I did it with different text views, I'd have to create several of them, a new one for whenever I want bold text, and that's not very elegant.

@TITLE:Text detection on Seven Segment Display via Tesseract OCR
@CONTENT:The problem that I am running with is to extract the text out of an image and for this I have used Tesseract v3.02. The sample images from which I have to extract text are related to meter readings. Some of them are with solid sheet background and some of them have LED display. I have trained the dataset for solid sheet background and the results are some how effective. The major problem I have now is the text images with LED/LCD background which are not recognized by Tesseract and due to this the training set isn't generated. Can anyone guide me to the right direction on how to use Tesseract with the Seven Segment Display(LCD/LED background) or is there any other alternative that I can use instead of Tesseract.

@TITLE:Custom Layout Inflation with Fragments in Robolectric not working
@CONTENT:When inflating a layout in a Fragment, with the LayoutInflater, i am getting this exception:  ./res/layout/locations_list.xml line #-1 (sorry, not yet implemented): Error inflating class com.costum.android.widget.LoadMoreListView
 I figured out that this is happening when inflating a custom layout in @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
            Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.locations_list, container, false);
    }
 Edit This is the locations_list.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:background="@android:color/white"
    android:orientation="vertical" >

    <com.costum.android.widget.LoadMoreListView
        android:id="@+id/android:list"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:padding="0dp" />

</LinearLayout>
 any other layout inflator works, like in this test: @Test
    public void testInflator() {
        ActivityController<SherlockFragmentActivity> activityController = CustomTestRunner
                .startActivity();
        SherlockFragmentActivity activity = activityController.get();
        LayoutInflater from = LayoutInflater.from(activity);
        View view = from
                .inflate(com.twisper.R.layout.locations_list_item, null);
        assertNotNull(view);
    }
 I am using Robolectric with the 2.2-SNAPSHOTs , Now my question is how could I work around this issue or how could I implement the missing functionality, the robolectric documentation is very sparse, hence I had trouble to find any starting point.

@TITLE:Making a Group hide Actors outside of its bounds
@CONTENT:I have created a very simple plot that is dynamically updated by adding new images on the right side of the screen, and then making them move towards the left side. This way, the plot within the screen's bounds looks like they are plotted as time goes by. Unfortunately, when doing it this way, I have to let the images start outside of the screen, and move into view, and I can't remove them again before they are completely outside of the screen on the left side. This results in the images being partially visible outside of the screen's bounds. The control is created as a Group that contains two static images (a black background and the image of the screen as foreground), plus all the moving images in between. This Group is then added to my Stage (like all other actors), and drawn as part of the Stage. In the image below, the control's bounds are marked with red. I would like to hide the parts of the moving images that are outside of these bounds. Is this possible to do using some libGDX functionality I have missed? By somehow constraining the Group's drawing area, perhaps? My other alternatives are to draw parts of the blue background in front of the screen, to hide the outliers, or to make the screen's edges thick enough to hide them. I think that both these solutions are unnecessarily inconvenient, and I'm pretty sure there is a better way to do this. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:Closing active connections using RMySQL
@CONTENT:As per my question earlier today, I suspect I have an issue with unclosed connections that is blocking data from being injected into my MySQL database. Data is being allowed into tables that are not currently being used (hence I suspect many open connections preventing uploading into that particular table). I am using RMySQL on Ubuntu servers to upload data onto a MySQL database. I'm looking for a way to a) determine if connections are open b) close them if they are. The command exec sp_who and exec sp_who2 from the sql command line returns a sql code error. Another note: I am able to connect, complete the uploading process, and end the R process successfully, and there is no data on the server (checked via the sql command line) when I try only that table. (BTW: If all else fails, would simply deleting the table and creating a new one with the same name fix it? It would be quite a pain, but doable.) Thanks for your help!

@CONTENT:The Hibernate docs show this example: session = sessionFactory.openSession();
session.beginTransaction();
List result = session.createQuery( "from Event" ).list();

 Why is it necessary to perform the session.getTransaction().commit() even though the Event list was merely printed out?

string orderby = "BookID ASC";
IQueryable<T> MyDataQueryable = _DataRawBase.AsQueryable<T>();
MyDataQueryable = MyDataQueryable.Where(where).OrderBy(orderby);
 Now I want to query the MyDataQueryable to do a SUM (and perhaps Average) of certain fields. How would I go about this? Something like: double mysum = MyDataQueryable.Sum("Price");  
 would be nice...

@TITLE:How to convince jenkins to share a build number for several jobs?
@CONTENT:I do have a requirement from the development team to setup the build system so each build will have an unique build number for all branches. The builds are made by jenkins using jobs for each branch. There is a jenkins plugin that can setup the next buildnumber for a job but this is kinda useless for at least two reasons: it will set the build number for a single job and you cannot know all how to setup it for all branches because they can be removed or added at any time it doesn't set it for current build How to we get the build numbers: we do make a HTTP call with the branch name and the revision number in git/mercurial. Based on this the centralized sever is giving us a build number as a response. If you call it twice with the same parameters, you will get the same response (desired behaviour). Now, how can we tweak jenkins to use the same build numbers as us? Obviously I could use the build number returned from the script, but the job number would be different and I doubt jenkins will know that I touched the BUILD_NUMBER variable inside my script. Mainly, what I need is some kind of pre-job-start script that I can run, one that would run before the build number is assigned to the job.

@TITLE:How to perform batch update in Spring with a list of maps?
@CONTENT:New to Spring, I am trying to insert a List<Map<String, Object>> into a table. Until now I have been using the SqlParameterSource for batch update, which works fine when a java bean is supplied to them. Something like this:     @Autowired
    private NamedParameterJDBCTemplate v2_template;

    public int[] bulkInsertIntoSiteTable(List<SiteBean> list){
            SqlParameterSource[] batch = SqlParameterSourceUtils
                    .createBatch(list.toArray());
            int[] updateCounts = v2_template
                    .batchUpdate(
                            "insert into sitestatus (website, status, createdby) values (:website, :status, :username)",
                            batch);

            return updateCounts;

        }
 However, I tried the same technique with a list of maps in place of a bean, it failed (rightly so). public int[] bulkInsertIntoSiteTable(List<Map<String, Object>> list){
        SqlParameterSource[] batch = SqlParameterSourceUtils
                .createBatch(list.toArray());
        int[] updateCounts = v2_template
                .batchUpdate(
                        "insert into sitestatus (website, status, createdby) values (:website, :status, :username)",
                        batch);

        return updateCounts;

    }
 The above code failed with the following exception: Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: No value supplied for the SQL parameter 'website': Invalid property 'website' of bean class [org.springframework.util.LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap]: Bean property 'website' is not readable or has an invalid getter method: Does the return type of the getter match the parameter type of the setter?

 It fails as it considers the list to be a batch of beans, I guess. I cannot find a way to perform a batch update in Spring with a list of maps and using NamedParameterJDBCTemplate. Please advice.

@LINK:/questions/17327912/python-parse-ipv4-addresses-from-string-even-when-censored
@TITLE:Python - parse IPv4 addresses from string (even when censored)
@CONTENT:Objective: Write Python 2.7 code to extract IPv4 addresses from string. String content example: The following are IP addresses: 192.168.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 101.099.098.000. These can also appear as 192.168.1[.]1 or 192.168.1(.)1 or 192.168.1[dot]1 or 192.168.1(dot)1 or 192 .168 .1 .1 or 192. 168. 1. 1. and these censorship methods could apply to any of the dots (Ex: 192[.]168[.]1[.]1). As you can see from the above, I am struggling to find a way to parse through a txt file that may contain IPs depicted in multiple forms of "censorship" (to prevent hyper-linking). I'm thinking that a regex expression is the way to go. Maybe say something along the lines of; any grouping of four ints 0-255 or 000-255 separated by anything in the 'separators list' which would consist of periods, brackets, parenthesis, or any of the other aforementioned examples. This way, the 'separators list' could be updated at as needed. Not sure if this is the proper way to go or even possible so, any help with this is greatly appreciated. Update: Thanks to recursive's answer below, I now have the following code working for the above example. It will... find the IPs place them into a list clean them of the spaces/braces/etc and replace the uncleaned list entry with the cleaned one. Caveat: The code below does not account for incorrect/non-valid IPs such as 192.168.0.256 or 192.168.1.2.3 Currently, it will drop the trailing 6 and 3 from the aforementioned. If its first octet is invalid (ex:256.10.10.10) it will drop the leading 2 (resulting in 56.10.10.10). import re

@TITLE:Send ArrayBuffer with other string in one Ajax call through jQuery
@CONTENT:I'm working on a project need to upload large file to server side. I decided to use HTML5 FileReader and jQuery to upload the file in chunks (ArrayBuffer). I successfully finished this task by converting the chunks into base64 string, send to backend server through jQuery.post with the data parameter in JSON format. For example $.ajax({ url: "/Home/Upload", type: "POST", data: { name: block.name, index: block.index, base64: base64 }, processData: true }); But I'd like to optimize this code since base64 is too large to transform. I'd like to know if I could send ArrayBuffer directly through $.ajax. I know that if I set the processData: false and just put ArrayBuffer into data parameter it could be sent to my server side as Request.InputStream. But in this way I cannot attach other data such as name and index. I'd like to know may I send the raw ArrayBuffer (or blob, binary) alone with my other data (name, index) in one ajax call.
@CODE:$.ajax({ url: "/Home/Upload", type: "POST", data: { name: block.name, index: block.index, base64: base64 }, processData: true }); $.ajax processData: false Request.InputStream name index

@TITLE:Adding point and value to line chartK how to color the point like the line?
@CONTENT:I've started from the multiline example http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955 I extended it to show the dots along the line, but I'm not able to give to the circle the same color of the line... I'm really new in d3.js and I really need an advice. here the example page: http://www.danielepennati.com/d3/linea.html I've change some variable name to make the script more general so there is some difference with the original example code. the main one is the name of the variable that contain the mapped data: it is "column" and not "cities" d3.tsv(surce_data, function(error, data) {
color.domain(d3.keys(data[0]).filter(function(key) { return key !== "id"; }));

var column = color.domain().map(function(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    values: data.map(function(d) {
      return {id: d.id, value: +replace(d[name])};
    })
  };
});
 the second main difference is the x axsis: in my code it is ordinal and not linear. so to draw the line the code is: var tracciato = svg.selectAll(".line-group")
.data(column)
.enter().append("g")
.attr("class", "line-group");

tracciato.append("path")
.attr("class", "line")
.attr("d", function(d) { return line(d.values); })
.style("stroke", function(d) { return color(d.name); });
 to make the points along the line I've wrote this code: var point = tracciato.append("g")
    .attr("class", "line-point");

    point.selectAll('circle')
    .data(function(d,i){ return d.values})
    .enter().append('circle')
    .attr("cx", function(d, i) {
        return x(i) + x.rangeBand() / 2;
      })
     .attr("cy", function(d, i) { return y(d.value) })
     .attr("r", 5);
 I'd link the points color be the same of the line, but the problem is the colors are assigned to the "column" object. I don't know how to give to each new circle within the same column the same column color... I don't know if my problem is clear, please ask me if you need any more specification. Thanks
@CODE:d3.tsv(surce_data, function(error, data) {

@TITLE:Accomplishing MYSQL's Group_Concat in SQL Server [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Concatenate many rows into a single text string? 31 answers I'm porting an application I originally wrote to run on Apache using PHP and a MySQL database. One of the queries used the MySQL functions of Concat_WS and Group_Concat to first concatenate a few different columns into one string, and then concatenate all items that were grouped together by the Group_By clause. As an example: ID    Name    Candy
1     John    M&Ms
1     John    KitKat
 The query: Select Group_Concat(Concat_WS('-',Name, Candy) Separator '00--00') as UserCandy
From ExampleTable
Group By ID
 The result: UserCandy
John-M&Ms00--00John-KitKat
 Now, I am trying to accomplish the same result in SQL Server 2008 using PHP 5.4+. What I've tried: SELECT Stuff(name + ';' + candy, 1, 0, '-----') AS UserCandy 
FROM   test 
 The problem can be seen in the fiddle that I have setup. The expected result would be: -----John;MMs-----John;KitKat
 Lastly, this becomes even more difficult when I add more columns to the mix. I want to merge the results (as shown above) where the ID is the same. This works very well with group_concat because it will automatically merge rows that have been grouped together.
@CODE:Concat_WS Group_Concat Group_By ID    Name    Candy

However, I'll be honest, I'm new to Ruby and clicking on the documentation (see link) leaves me a little bit confused about where to start (i.e. a good example would be nice) I also see other smaller gems and libraries that users have designed, but I'm restricted to using certified gems from the rubyGems database as this is for official work use.

 According to the Rails Guide for Active Record Associations (4.3.3.1 where), I believe my usage of the scope and expectation are valid: If you use a hash-style where option, then record creation via this association will be automatically scoped using the hash. Why is the artist_tracks.artistic_role_id attribute being lost? If my expectations are wrong, I'd like to understand why and how to implement an alternative solution. I have also listed this as an issue on the Rails repo. Any insight is appreciated! Thank you

@TITLE:Copying strided data in C++
@CONTENT:I have two arrays and I want to copy one array into the other with some stride. For example, I have A A A A A A A A ...

B B B B B B B B ...
 and I want to copy every three elements of B to A to obtain B A A B A A B A ...
 From the post "Is there a standard, strided version of memcpy?", it seems that there is no such a possibility in C. However, I have experienced that, in some cases, memcpy is faster than a for loop based copy. My question is; Is there any way to efficiently perform strided memory copy in C++ performing at least as a standard for loop? Thank you very much. EDIT - CLARIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM To make the problem clearer, let us denote the two arrays at hand by a and b. I have a function that performs the unique following for loop for (int i=0; i<NumElements, i++)
    a_[i] = b_[i];
 where both the []'s are overloaded operators (I'm using an expression templates technique) so that they can be actually mean, for example  a[3*i]=b[i];
@CODE:A A A A A A A A ...

B B B B B B B B ... B A B A A B A A B A ... memcpy for for a b for for (int i=0; i<NumElements, i++)

@CONTENT:The Standard states, that nullptr is a pointer literal of type std::nullptr_t (2.14.7). And 18.2p9 defines nullptr_t by namespace std {
  typedef decltype(nullptr) nullptr_t;
}
 By 7.1.6.2p4 decltype(nullptr) is the type of the expression nullptr, which is by definition std::nullptr_t (since the expression nullptr is a prvalue). Substituting that into the definition of nullptr_t results in typedef nullptr_t nullptr_t
 On the other hand a typedef specifier does not introduce a new type, it's just a name for another existing type. So, what is exactly nullptr_t? I'm not able to comprehend these definitions.

@TITLE:Java - why does char get implicitly cast to byte (and short) primitive, when it shouldn't?
@CONTENT:Certain functionality of the compiler puzzles me (Oracle JDK 1.7 using Eclipse). So I've got this book that says char primitive needs to be explicitly cast to short and byte and this all makes sense due the data types' allowed ranges don't overlap. In other words below code works (but wouldn't work without the explicit type casts): char c = '&';  
byte b = (byte)c;
short s = (short)c;
 Printing b or s correctly displays the number 38, which is the numeric equivalent of (&) in Unicode. Which brings me to my actual question. Why does the following work as well? byte bc = '&';
short sc = '&';
System.out.println(bc); // Correctly displays number 38 on the console
System.out.println(sc); // Correctly displays number 38 on the console
 Now I would certainly understand the following (which works too): byte bt = (byte)'&';
System.out.println(bt); // Correctly displays number 38 on the console
 But this no-compiler-warning char to byte (and short) "sneak conversion" doesn't seem right to me. Can some one explain, why this is allowed? Could the reason be in the interpretation of the '<char>' itself, so that it doesn't actually ever get to a char primitive state but is handled as a numeric (octal or hexadecimal etc) value?
@CODE:char c = '&';  
byte b = (byte)c;
short s = (short)c; byte bc = '&';
short sc = '&';
System.out.println(bc); // Correctly displays number 38 on the console
System.out.println(sc); // Correctly displays number 38 on the console byte bt = (byte)'&';
System.out.println(bt); // Correctly displays number 38 on the console '<char>'

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: UK Postcode Regex (Comprehensive) 24 answers I'm looking to be able to validate UK Postcodes, and ideally, I would like the following cases to pass: W1 W12 WC1 WC1A WC12 W1 6BT W12 6BT WC1 6BT WC1A 6BT WC12 6BT W16BT W126BT WC16BT WC1A6BT WC126BT I have the following regex patterns: ^(GIR 0AA)|(((A[BL]|B[ABDHLNRSTX]?|C[ABFHMORTVW]|D[ADEGHLNTY]|E[HNX]?|F[KY]|G[LUY]?|H[ADGPRSUX]|I[GMPV]|JE|K[ATWY]|L[ADELNSU]?|M[EKL]?|N[EGNPRW]?|O[LX]|P[AEHLOR]|R[GHM]|S[AEGKLMNOPRSTY]?|T[ADFNQRSW]|UB|W[ADFNRSV]|YO|ZE)[1-9]?[0-9]|((E|N|NW|SE|SW|W)1|EC[1-4]|WC[12])[A-HJKMNPR-Y]|(SW|W)([2-9]|[1-9][0-9])|EC[1-9][0-9])( [0-9][ABD-HJLNP-UW-Z]{2})?)$
 This pattern allows for 3 or 4 & 6 or 7 digit postcodes (so either outward code only with 3 or 4 digits, or full postcodes with 6 or 7 digits) however it doesn't allow for points 4 and 6 (postcodes where spaces have been omitted) I also have this pattern: ^(GIR 0AA|[A-PR-UWYZ]([0-9]{1,2}|([A-HK-Y][0-9]|[A-HK-Y][0-9]([0-9]|[ABEHMNPRV-Y]))|[0-9][A-HJKPS-UW]) {0,1}[0-9][ABD-HJLNP-UW-Z]{2})$
 This pattern allows for 6 or 7 digit postcodes, with our without the space, but not for incomplete postcodes (outward code only) Sorry for asking a question that has been covered so extensively already on here, but all the examples I found, they match part of my requirement, but not all of it. Ideally, I'd like a regex pattern that allows 3, 4, 6 & 7 digit postcodes, with our without spaces. UPDATE: I've re done my pass cases as I don't think it was entirely comprehensive initially. The basic concept that is it should follow UK postcode patterns, and validate any of the following combinations: 1 Letter 1 Number
1 Letter 2 Numbers
2 Letters 1 Number
2 Letters 1 Number 1 Letter
2 Letters 2 Numbers
1 Letter 1 Number (OptionalSpace) 1 Number 2 Letters
1 Letter 2 Numbers (OptionalSpace) 1 Number 2 Letters
2 Letters 1 Number (OptionalSpace) 1 Number 2 Letters
2 Letters 1 Number 1 Letter (OptionalSpace) 1 Number 2 Letters
2 Letters 2 Numbers (OptionalSpace) 1 Number 2 Letters
 ^ Hope the above makes sense, and is detailed enough. Bit hard to read I know. ANSWER: So I now have a regex that passes all the cases above (example and pattern). As mentioned in the comment below, it's very hard, if not impossible to cater for ALL UK postcodes, nevertheless, the one below does all I need and should be good for 90% of input cases: ^(GIR 0AA)|[a-z-[qvx]](?:\d|\d{2}|[a-z-[qvx]]\d|[a-z-[qvx]]\d[a-z-[qvx]]|[a-z-[qvx]]\d{2})(?:\s?\d[a-z-[qvx]]{2})?$

@TITLE:For loop without the second condition, i.e. the boolean check?
@CONTENT:I have to write a function that calculates the floor of log base 16 of an unsigned int passed in. There are restrictions as to what operators and what constants we are allowed to use, and we can only use specifically for loops. For clarity, we cannot use any conditional statements(if, else, switch ... ). The function prototype is: int floor_log16(unsigned int x); 
 Allowed operators: ++ -- = & | ~ ^ << ! >> Allowed constants: 1 2 3 4 8 16 I wrote a version of the program as follows: int floor_log16(unsigned int x) {
    int index=1;
    int count=(1!=1);

    count--;

    for(; index<=x; index<<=4) {
        count++;
    }

    return count;
}
 which seems to work as desired. However, I realized that based on the later functions and description of the needed functionality we have to write, I noticed that under "allowed operators" sometimes > and < were listed. I deduce this implies that since for the floor_log16 function listed above, we weren't explicitly told to use > or <, I can only assume that the solution posted above will not be accepted. This leaves me rather confused because I don't understand how you can possibly have a for loop without a boolean check? Isn't the whole idea of a loop to iterate while a condition is met?
@CODE:for int floor_log16(unsigned int x); ++ -- = & | ~ ^ << ! >> 1 2 3 4 8 16 int floor_log16(unsigned int x) {
    int index=1;
    int count=(1!=1);

    count--;

    for(; index<=x; index<<=4) {
        count++;
    }

    return count;
} > < floor_log16 > < else if (condition) statement; for(;condition;) {statement; break;} for(;x;x>>4) x == 0 int count = (1 != 1) index <<= 4 index = index << 4

@TITLE:Using Ant's classpath in Eclipse
@CONTENT:I have an Ant build.xml file that works just fine on the command line: it compiles, builds the JAR, and I am able to execute the main method from the JAR just fine. The build.xml file references several thirdparty libraries that are scattered here and there. When building the JAR, the script doesn't include all the thirdparty libraries into the JAR itself. Instead, it puts their path into the JAR's manifest. This helps to keep my JAR slim and tidy. I'd like to be able to edit and debug my project in Eclipse, but I can't find an easy way to do so. I can have my project use the Ant file to build the project, and that seems to work. However, Eclipse is having trouble finding the thirdparty libaries, and thus Eclipse is having two problems: it shows (in the text editor) lots of compile errors, because lots of classes are undefined, and it can't execute the JAR. I can solve both of the above problems by specifying by hand, in two difference places (i.e., the build path via Properties->Java Build Path->Libraries, and the execution classpath via Run Configurations->Classpath), all the third party libraries. But it seems like I shouldn't have to do this manually, since all the third party libraries are already listed in my JAR's manifest. What am I doing wrong? Here's my build.xml file: <!-- Set global properties for this build -->

 You can see that I have third-party libraries in several directories (${lib}, ${hive-util}, ${hpdb}, and ${static}). I use these to create a path called dep.runtime. I then include dep.runtime in the manifest when building my jar. How can I get Eclipse to use the same dep.runtime for the build path and the classpath when executing?

@TITLE:Triggering a custom jQuery event without bubbling
@CONTENT:I want to trigger a non-bubblable custom jQuery event on an object. I know we can either use return false or stopPropagation to prevent bubbling. What I want to know is can I trigger a custom event and specify that by default it does not bubble. This is the code I have now         $(".abc").on("change", function () {
            var e = new $.Event("datachange");
            $(this).trigger(e)
        });
 The above triggers the datachange event on #abc and bubbles the event all the way up. I don't want that. I can achieve that by using the following.         $(".abc").on("change", function () {
            var e = new $.Event("datachange");
            //e.stopPropagation(); this does not work
            $(this).trigger(e)
        }).on("datachange", function (e) {
            e.stopPropagation();
            return false;
        });
 I read that triggerHandler does something similar, but only for the first matching element. Is there a better way to achieve this?
@CODE:$(".abc").on("change", function () {
            var e = new $.Event("datachange");
            $(this).trigger(e)

            var e = new $.Event("datachange");

@TITLE:safari rounding down on subpixel calculations
@CONTENT:i have a container that takes up 829px on a row, and has a background-image of the same size. i have a div within that container that calculates its width based on the 829px container. on safari, the divs width comes out to be something like 173.8px, but since safari/webkit round down, its truncated and becomes 173px in width. this 829px container has 3 divs inline on the same row. the first div, 1px is lost, the second, 2px is lost, and by the third, 3 pixels are lost, so the third div is shifted left by three pixels. on an ipad, thats 6 pixels lost. i've tried to search for subpixel rendering problems, and ive read john resigs article and some other SO questions but i couldnt find a solution. on google, i found an article: http://www.pixafy.com/blog/2013/05/css-subpixel-rendering/#more-310 i tried to apply it to my situation, but i cannot get away with not setting a width thats calculated on the containers 829px. what can i do?

@CONTENT:I could'nt find a solution to a problem that has been hindering the use of notepad++. When you double click text to highlight that text and others like it, camelCase or under_score words work great, but when hyphen-words-are-clicked this does not treat it as a single word and only highlights the segment between the "-". question: how can you customize notepad++ so that hyphenated words are treated as single words? or does anyone know a text editor that does this? saw this, but not sure how to implement it: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/notepad-plus/index.php?title=Word_Customisation this was really helpful: Where are the recorded macros stored in Notepad++?

@TITLE:Form Validation with Dependent Fields in AngularJS
@CONTENT:I have an object that has 2 fields, while 1 should be less than or equal to another. Say it's HDD quota settings and I need the threshold to be less than or equal to HDD's size. I am trying to use angular's ui-utils#validate. This is how I got so far: http://embed.plnkr.co/EysaRdu2vuuyXAXJcJmE/preview (i hope the link will work) The problem that I am having is that it works to one direction: Setting size and then playing with threshold works ok But if I try to change size, after threshold is in invalid state - nothing happens. This is because invalid threshold is not set on the model and size id being compared against null or undefined (or something like that). On one hand I understand the logic of not setting invalid value on the model... but here it is getting in my way. So, any help making this work will be appreciated.

@TITLE:Using standard io stream:stdin and stdout in a matlab exe
@CONTENT:Question I want it to 'listen' to the standard input stream in a running (compiled) Matlab executable. This is how I believe it is done in c or a similar language: #include stdio.h
fgets(line, 256, stdin)
 Or more elaborately, it it can be used as such: if (!fgets(line, 256, stdin))
    return;
if (line[0] == '\n')
    continue;
sscanf(line, "%s", command);
 Answer For completeness I will leave the background and notes intact, but with the help of Amro and EitanT I have managed to work it out. Background I have found how to do this in other languages, and here are some instructions for the compilation process. However, I have not found anywhere how to 'listen' to the input in Matlab. The closest I have come is this description of C-like IO in Octave, but I cannot make progress with this as I looking for a solution in MATLAB. Note that altering or wrapping the program that sends the data over the stream is not possible, and that I would prefer a pure MATLAB solution rather than wrapping my entire program. If I were to call a trivial function from MATLAB in a different language that would be ok. What have I tried? I tried a few functions from the command window like fgets(0) (fid = 0 seems to be the id corresponding to stdin (as mentioned by @EitanT and seen when trying fopen(0)) )but it just returns: Operation is not implemented for requested file identifier.
 I have also considered using the option in MATLAB to invoke system commands or execute java / perl commands, but so far without luck. I am also not sure whether these would still work after compilation. Furthermore I attempted to use input('prompt','s') this works when I open the program via cmd, but does not do anything until I hit enter. (Which the program that I listen to of course will never do, in the best case I can get \n at the end of each line). I also tried out waitinput from File Exchange but I think this is a dead end as it did not catch anything and seems to perform quite poorly. Notes I am using Windows 7 and MATLAB 2012b. I found popen on File Exchange but that does not seem to be available for Windows. When I simply type something like 'show me' this is properly sent to the standard output stream.
@CODE:c #include stdio.h
fgets(line, 256, stdin) if (!fgets(line, 256, stdin))
    return;
if (line[0] == '\n')
    continue;
sscanf(line, "%s", command); fgets(0) fid = 0 stdin fopen(0) Operation is not implemented for requested file identifier. java perl input('prompt','s') cmd \n waitinput popen 'show me' input input()

@CONTENT:Sorry for my English. My work is based on https://github.com/harism/android_page_curl/ After many hours of research, I have found a few solutions, but not for all the issues what I have in my application. I've some trouble with a GLSurfaceView. I've got a background with a relativeLayout, a GLSurfaceView, and an overlay on top. <RelativeLayout

@CONTENT:Delphi IDE uses InstallAware as installer in last few releases (2010, XE, XE2, XE3, XE4). Using the normal setup.exe installation will copy a few GB of files into c:\programdata if you install all the IDE releases. The installer consumes disk spaces quickly especially for users who use an SSD hard disk that is expensive. Is it possible to setup the Delphi IDEs without copying files to c:\ProgramData? Is it advisable to delete those files manually after installation too? Uninstalling a previous version of the IDE does delete these files but as component maker, I need those IDEs for testing.

@CONTENT:Is there a quick way to add a table to my ggplot2 graph? I would like this table to have the value of each line at the same breakpoints as specified in scale_x_continuous(), but with the percentage (%) symbol next to them. My end goal is to create something like the image below. However, I don't know how to add the table. The following block of code just makes two lines in ggplot2 and should be adequate to provide me with an example: require(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(a = seq(0, 90, 10), b = seq(10, 100, 10))
df.plot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = seq(1, 100, 10))) + geom_line(aes(y = a), colour = 'red') +
           geom_line(aes(y = b), colour = 'blue') + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,100,10))
df.plot
 A similar question was asked here, but the given answer is more of a workaround and wouldn't look good for a table with 2 rows. I am going to mess around with the clues provided by Brian Diggs, but I figured I would post this in case anyone has already done something like this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Edit: Thanks to @baptiste for helping me figure this out. I posted my own response below that finished what he started.

SOLVED: Ok I found the reason!! Thank you very much for that site, Flipbed. On IE10, the "border-radius" to me doesn't work. In order to get it working, it's necessary to specify each corner: border-top-left-radius:5px;
border-top-right-radius:5px;
border-bottom-left-radius:5px;
border-bottom-right-radius:5px;
 Indeed the site you sent, does exactly that (look the page source). It gives as output the instruction: border-radius: 5px;
 but internally it declares the 4 corners separately as above :)
@CODE:<style>
#about-kader {
    width: 200px;
    height: 180px; 
    float: left;
    margin: 0px auto;
    background-color: #9bafc4;
    padding: 3px;
    border-radius: 5px; 
    -moz-border-radius: 5px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 5px; 
    -khtml-border-radius: 5px;
    -ms-border-radius: 5px;
    behavior: url(border-radius.htc);
}
</style> <div id="about-kader">
...
...
...
</div> border-top-left-radius:5px;
border-top-right-radius:5px;
border-bottom-left-radius:5px;
border-bottom-right-radius:5px; border-radius: 5px;

@CONTENT:If I have a page with: <body>

 Is it possible for the layout to not render this section, or is that contrary to how this should work conceptually. Seems like it would be useful to be able to not render certain sections on a page (unless I'm thinking about this incorrectly). Edit: Including the error message may be helpful, when I put a section into the main page, the layout page fails with: The following sections have been defined but have not been rendered for the layout page "/Views/Layouts/_Layout1.cshtml": "SomeStuff". As if it's forcing me to render every section on the page or something. In otherwords, in Layout.cshtml, I don't call @RenderSection, but in Index.html I have a section called SomeStuff defined. Is that legal? Seems like it's forcing me to render all sections in the page, but that seems like sections should be optional, no?

@TITLE:Is __int128_t arithmetic emulated by GCC, even with SSE?
@CONTENT:I've heard that the 128-bit integer data-types like __int128_t provided by GCC are emulated and therefore slow. However, I understand that the various SSE instruction sets (SSE, SSE2, ..., AVX) introduced at least some instructions for 128-bit registers. I don't know very much about SSE or assembly / machine code, so I was wondering if someone could explain to me whether arithmetic with __int128_t is emulated or not using modern versions of GCC. The reason I'm asking this is because I'm wondering if it makes sense to expect big differences in __int128_t performance between different versions of GCC, depending on what SSE instructions are taken advantage of. So, what parts of __int128_t arithmetic are emulated by GCC, and what parts are implemented with SSE instructions (if any)?

@TITLE:Error in heatmap.2 (gplots)
@CONTENT:Ive moved on to a new server and Installed R version 3.0 on it. (gplots library was no longer available for 2.14) Using a script that worked for version 2.14 I now encounter a problem generating a heatmap. In R version 3 I get an error: Error in lapply(args, is.character) : node stack overflow
Error in dev.flush() : node stack overflow
Error in par(op) : node stack overflow
 In R version 2.14 I get an error: Error: evaluation nested too deeply: infinite recursion / options(expressions=)?
 Which I can resolve by increasing the options(expressions=500000) In R version 3 increasing this option does not resolve the issue. And Im still stuck with the same error. The script is the same for both: y=read.table("test", row.names=1, sep="\t", header=TRUE)
hr <- hclust(dist(as.matrix(y)))
hc <- hclust(dist(as.matrix(t(y))))
mycl <- cutree(hr, k=7); mycolhc <- rainbow(length(unique(mycl)), start=0.1, end=0.9); mycolhc     <- mycolhc[as.vector(mycl)]

 Where "test" is a tdl file with headers and row names and a 40*5000 0/1 matrix Any help would be appreciated PS: When I reduce my data set to 2000 lines I no longer get the error. PSS: Increasing the dataset to 2500 lines resulted in the same error; However, removing all non-informative lines (all 1s) left me with 3700 lines. Using this data set did not result in the error.

@TITLE:Merging a list of Strings using mkString vs foldRight
@CONTENT:I am currently trying out things in Scala, trying to get accustomed to functional programming as well as leaning a new language again (it's been a while since last time). Now given a list of strings if I want to merge them into one long string (e.g. "scala", "is", "fun" => "scalaisfun") I figured one way to do it would be to do a foldRight and apply concatenation on the respective elements. Another way, admittedly much simpler, is to call mkString. I checked on github but couldn't really find the source code for the respective functions (any help on that would be appreciated), so I am not sure how the functions are implemented. From the top of my head, I think the mkString is more flexible but it feels that there might be a foldRight in the implementation somewhere. Is there any truth to it? Otherwise the scaladocs mention that mkString calls on toString for each respective element. Seeing that they are already strings to start with, that could be one negative point for mkStringin this particular case. Any comments on the pros and cons of both methods, with respect to performance, simplicity/elegance etc?

However, even if you package these into apps, I'm assuming you still have to deal with the Android fragmentation with various manufacturers making weird modifications to the browser. We've tested a lot of manufacturers (especially those from China) and the default Android browser is being hacked to death. Our app works perfectly in the Chrome browser on Android, so, the question is, is it possible to just literally put Chrome into the same package and just use that? Instead of some random modified browsers each manufacturer feels like making. Sorry if this is a dumb question, still very new to this. Any help / advice would be greatly appreciated!!

@LINK:/questions/16275928/hibernate-session-save-does-not-reflect-in-database
@TITLE:hibernate session.save() does not reflect in database
@CONTENT:According to my understanding in hibernate (please confirm) 1- You have to session.close() if you get it by getSessionFactory().openSession(). 2- No need to session.close() if you get it by getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession(). It is automatically closed after commit(). 3- @2 When using getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession(), we have to do all DB activities inside an active transaction so that we can commit() at the end. 4- Hibernate en-queues all save, update, and delete operations and submits them to the database server only after a flush() operation or committing the transaction or closing of the session in which these operations occur.(as per javadoc) From the above points if I consider 1 & 4, then the following code should work: Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();  
AccountDetails ac = new AccountDetails();  
//perform set operations  
session.save(ac);  
session.close();  
System.out.println("new account stored.");
 BUT it is not working i.e. it runs smoothly but does not reflect(store) in database.Why this is so ? When I write the code inside a transaction and commit, then it is stored. I think I am missing a basic thing. Please clarify.
@CODE:session.close() getSessionFactory().openSession() session.close() getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession() getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession() Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();

@TITLE:PHP creating a multidimensional array of message threads from a multidimensional array (IMAP)
@CONTENT:My question is the following: If you look below you'll see there is a datastructure with message ids and then the final datastructure containing the message details which should be aggregated from imap_fetch_overview. The message ids are from imap_thread. The problem is its not putting the email details in the position where the message id is. Here is my datastructure: [5] => Array
    (
        [0] => 5
        [1] => 9
    )

[10] => Array
    (
        [0] => 10
        [1] => 11
    )
 What I'd like to have is: [5] => Array
    (
        [0] => messageDetails for id 5
        [1] => messageDetails for id 9
    )

[10] => Array
    (
        [0] => messageDetails for id 10
        [1] => messageDetails for id 11
    )
 Here is the code I have thus far: $emails = imap_fetch_overview($imap, implode(',',$ids));

// root is the array index position of the threads message, such as 5 or 10
foreach($threads as $root => $messages){

    // id is the id being given to us from `imap_thread`
    foreach($message as $key => $id){

      foreach($emails as $index => $email){

         if($id === $email->msgno){
             $threads[$root][$key] = $email;
             break;
          }
      }
    }
 }
 Here is a printout from one of the $emails:     [0] => stdClass Object
    (
        [subject] => Cloud Storage Dump
        [from] => Josh Doe
        [to] => jondoe@domain.com
        [date] => Mon, 21 Jan 2013 23:18:00 -0500
        [message_id] => <50FE12F8.9050506@domain.com>
        [size] => 2559
        [uid] => 5
        [msgno] => 5
        [recent] => 0
        [flagged] => 0
        [answered] => 1
        [deleted] => 0
        [seen] => 0
        [draft] => 0
        [udate] => 1358828308
    )
 If you notice, the msgno is 5 which corrolates to the $id, so technically the data should be populating into the final datastructure. Also, this seems like an inefficient way to handle this. Please let me know if I you need any additional clarification. UPDATE CODE This code is a combination of code I found on php api and some fixes by me. What I think is problematic still is the $root. $addedEmails = array();
$thread = imap_thread($imap);
foreach ($thread as $i => $messageId) { 
    list($sequence, $type) = explode('.', $i); 
    //if type is not num or messageId is 0 or (start of a new thread and no next) or is already set 
   if($type != 'num' || $messageId == 0 || ($root == 0 && $thread[$sequence.'.next'] == 0) || isset($rootValues[$messageId])) { 
    //ignore it 
    continue; 
} 

if(in_array($messageId, $addedEmails)){
    continue;
}
array_push($addedEmails,$messageId);

//if this is the start of a new thread 
if($root == 0) { 
    //set root 
    $root = $messageId; 
} 

//at this point this will be part of a thread 
//let's remember the root for this email 
$rootValues[$messageId] = $root; 

//if there is no next 
if($thread[$sequence.'.next'] == 0) { 
    //reset root 
    $root = 0; 
    } 
  }
$ids=array();
$threads = array();
foreach($rootValues as $id => $root){
    if(!array_key_exists($root,$threads)){
        $threads[$root] = array();
    }
    if(!in_array($id,$threads[$root])){
        $threads[$root][] = $id;
       $ids[]=$id;
    }
 }
 $emails = imap_fetch_overview($imap, implode(',', array_keys($rootValues)));

 $keys = array();
 foreach($emails as $k => $email)
 {
$keys[$email->msgno] = $k;

 $threads = array_map(function($thread) use($emails, $keys)

@TITLE:Confidence intervals for model prediction
@CONTENT:I am following along with a statsmodels tutorial An OLS model is fitted with formula = 'S ~ C(E) + C(M) + X' 
lm = ols(formula, salary_table).fit()
print lm.summary()
 Predicted values are provided through: lm.predict({'X' : [12], 'M' : [1], 'E' : [2]}) The result is returned as a single value array. Is there a method to also return confidence intervals for the predicted value (prediction intervals) in statsmodels? Thanks.

 The created tables look like: EMP_PHONE
=================================
EMP_ID    PHONES_ID    PHONE_TYPE
------    ---------    ----------
42        1            NULL


EMPLOYEE
=================================
ID
--
42


PHONE
=================================
ID    NUM
--    --------
1     867-5309
 The NULL PHONE_TYPE seems to tell me something funky is going on, and the way that eclipselink is looking for EMPLOYEE.PHONE_TYPE makes me think it's thinking about the relationship from PHONE->EMPLOYEE rather than the other way around. the JPA entities are defined as follows. The phones map is unidirectional, and Phone objects should be shared by multiple Employees (not my actual types, but this simplified example demonstrates the problem) @Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id private long id;

    @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinTable(name="EMP_PHONE", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="EMP_ID"))
    @MapKeyColumn(name="PHONE_TYPE")
    private Map<String, Phone> phones = new HashMap<String, Phone>();

    public Employee() {}
    public Employee(long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public Map<String, Phone> getPhones() {
        return phones;
    }
}

@Entity
public class Phone {
    @Id
    private long id;
    private String num;

    public String getNum() {
        return num;
    }
    public Phone() {}
    public Phone(String num) {
        this.num = num;
    }
    public Phone(long id, String num) {
        this.id = id;
        this.num = num;
    }
    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
 using the following test code EntityManagerFactory factory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("test");
EntityManager em = factory.createEntityManager();
Employee employee = new Employee(42);
// exception will occur with or without phones added to the map
employee.getPhones().put("home", new Phone(1, "867-5309"));
em.getTransaction().begin();
em.persist(employee);
em.getTransaction().commit();

Query q = em.createQuery("select o from Employee o");
q.setHint("javax.persistence.cache.storeMode", "REFRESH");
q.getResultList();  // EXCEPTION THROWN HERE

@TITLE:Is ：const int x = get();； legal in C?Can we assign a function's return value to a constant at declaration?
@CONTENT:A highly reputed contributor "R.." on this forum explicitly told me this 2 days back: Initializers for objects of static storage duration must be constant expressions. The result of a function call is not a constant expression. He was talking about global variables.But I am not sure what goes with constants declared inside the main() function, or any function for that matter.Though intuitively I feel it is so even for constants declared within functions,the following program sourced from the following link, with its supposedly correct answer, is confusing me. http://www.indiabix.com/c-programming/const/discussion-546 #include<stdio.h>
int get();

int main()
{
    const int x = get();
    printf("%d", x);
    return 0;
}

int get()
{
    return 20;
}
 So can anyone explain whether it's valid in C to assign a return value to a constant?
@CODE:"R.." Initializers for objects of static storage duration must be constant expressions. The result of a function call is not a constant expression. main() correct #include<stdio.h>
int get();

int main()
{
    const int x = get();
    printf("%d", x);
    return 0;
}

int get()
{
    return 20;

@TITLE:Can I reuse an rvalue reference parameter to return an rvalue reference?
@CONTENT:Consider the following code: struct MyString
{
  // some ctors

  MyString& operator+=( const MyString& other ); // implemented correctly
};

MyString operator+( const MyString& lhs, const MyString& rhs )
{

MyString&& operator+( MyString&& lhs, const MyString& rhs )

}
 This works for the following use-case MyString a, b, c; // initialized properly
MyString result = a + b + c;
 But it creates a dangling reference for const MyString& result = a + b + c;
 Now, I understand why that is and how to fix it (returning an ravlue instead of an rvalue reference) but I consider it a usage error if someone writes the above as the code looks like it is asking for trouble. Is there any "canonical" real-world example where the above operator returning a rvalue reference is a problem? What is a convincing reason why I should always return an rvalue from operators?

@TITLE:Is there a size or term limit for a SOLR query string when using HTTP POST?
@CONTENT:I'm using Java to query a SOLR server for results that have IDs within a set of known IDs that I am interested in. The best way I could think to get just these results that I am interested in was to create a long query string that looks something like this: q=(item_id:XXX33-3333 OR item_id:YYY42-3445 OR item_id:JFDE-3838) I generate this String, queryString, before making my request, and there are over 1500 such ids included in the request I would eventually like to make. I am using an HTTP POST to make the query as such:         HttpPost post = new HttpPost(url);
        post.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8");

        StringEntity entity = new StringEntity(queryString, "UTF-8");
        entity.setContentType("application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8");
        post.setEntity(entity);

        HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
        HttpResponse response = client.execute(post);
 If I limit the query to just the first 1000 ids, it succeeds and I get the results back as I would expect. However, if I increase the query to include all 1500 that I am really interested in, I get an HTTP 400 response code with the following error: HTTP/1.1 400 org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: Cannot parse '[my query here...] Is there a limit to the number of ids that I can OR together in a SOLR query? Is there another reason this might be failing when I go past 1000? I have experimented and it fails at around 1024 (my ids are all almost the same length) so it seems to suggest there is a character or term limit. Or, if someone has a good suggestion of how I can retrieve the items I'm looking for in another, smarter, way, I would love to hear it. My backup solution is just to query SOLR for all items, parse the results, and use the ones that belong to the set I am interested in. I would prefer not to do this, since the data source could have tens of thousands of items, and it would be inefficient.
@CODE:q=(item_id:XXX33-3333 OR item_id:YYY42-3445 OR item_id:JFDE-3838) queryString HttpPost post = new HttpPost(url);

@TITLE:Android: Child process (logcat) keeps running after parent process (app) died
@CONTENT:our Android app spawns a logcat shell process and then reads its result for processing. However, when the app stops (e.g. when restarted after recompilation during development), the logcat process will keep running. Here's an example of this behaviour: processes = new ArrayList<Process>();

try {
  processes.add(Runtime.getRuntime().exec("logcat -v time"));
  processes.add(Runtime.getRuntime().exec("logcat -v time"));
  processes.add(Runtime.getRuntime().exec("logcat -v time"));
  processes.add(Runtime.getRuntime().exec("logcat -v time"));
} catch (IOException e) {
  // oh no!
}

Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
  public void run() {
    for (Process p : processes) {
      p.destroy();
    }
  };
});
 Add this to the onCreate() method of a test app, start it, then force-stop it using the settings manager. The child processes will keep running, now with a parent-id of 1. In How to kill logcat process initiated by Android application? it was suggested to use ProcessBuilder, but that wasn't a solution and the process will keep running, too. In Stop child process when parent process stops it was suggsted to use a shutdown hook - that doesn't work either as demonstrated above. Thanks!

@CONTENT:With the following code: int main(){

    return 0;
}

float multiply(float n){
    return n * 2;
}
 When I try to compile I get one warning: "'%f' expects 'double', but argument has type 'int'" and two errors: "conflicting types for 'multiply'", "previous implicit declaration of 'multiply' was here." Question 1: I am guessing that it's because, given the compiler has no knowledge of function 'multiply' when he comes across it the first time, he will invent a prototype, and invented prototypes always assume 'int' is both returned and taken as parameter. So the invented prototype would be "int multiply(int)", and hence the errors. Is this correct? Now, the previous code won't even compile. However, if I break the code in two files like this: #file1.c
 int main(){
    printf("%f\n",multiply(2));
    return 0;
 }

#file2.c
float multiply(float n){
    return n * 2;
}
 and execute "gcc file1.c file2.c -o file" it will still give one warning (that printf is expecting double but is getting int) but the errors won't show up anymore and it will compile. Question 2: How come when I break the code into 2 files it compiles? Question 3: Once I run the program above (the version split into 2 files) the result is that 0.0000 is printed on the screen. How come? I am guessing the compiler again invented a prototype that doesn't match the function, but why is 0 printed? And if I change the printf("%f") to printf("%d") it prints a 1. Again, any explanation of what's going on behind the scenes? Thanks a lot in advance.

@TITLE:Doubts on concurrency with objects that can be used multiple times like formatters
@CONTENT:Maybe a stupid question to ask but I need some confirmations on it. Usually, when I deal with objects that can be used multiple times within my application I use an approach like the following. Create an extension, say for example NSDecimalNumber+Extension, or a class utility where a number formatter is created like the following. + (NSNumberFormatter*)internal_sharedNumberFormatter
{
    static NSNumberFormatter* _internal_numberFormatter = nil;
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        _internal_numberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
        // other configurations here...
    });

    return _internal_numberFormatter;
}

+ (NSString*)stringRepresentationOfDecimalNumber:(NSDecimalNumber*)numberToFormat
{
    NSString *stringRepresentation = [[self class] internal_sharedNumberFormatter] stringFromNumber:numberToFormat];
    return stringRepresentation;
}
 This approach is quite good since, for example, formatters are expensive to create. But it could be applied to other situations as well. Now, my questions is the following. Does this approach is also valid in situations where different path of execution (different threads) are involved? So, if I call first stringRepresentationOfDecimalNumber on the main thread and then in a different thread, what could happen? I think is valid to perform different calls to stringRepresentationOfDecimalNumber in different threads since the shared formatter, in this case, is reading only, but I would like to have a reply from experts. Thanks in advance.

My best guess is that it is a problem when converting the textures to screen coords but really have no idea how to fix this. I would of thought this problem to have come up before but couldn't find any fixes anywhere. I have checked and double checked my precision with tile sizes and lining them up. Any help would be much appreciated. thanks.

@LINK:/questions/15995787/python-zelle-book-uses-eval-is-it-wrong
@TITLE:Python - Zelle book uses eval(), is it wrong?
@CONTENT:PLEASE NOTE: This is NOT about the use of eval(), it is about the potential quality (or lack thereof) of a book it is used and taught in. SO already has countless threads about eval() in Python. Risking to invite the wrath and downvotes of SO, I nonetheless decided to ask this question, just in case. Please bear with me. I've tried Google and SO itself for this specific question (as you will see) and got nothing. I might be blind, though. This question is about the use of the notorious eval() function. There is a relatively well-known (and well-reviewed, as you can see) book by John Zelle: http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282418/ref=pd_sim_b_3 Technically, it is a CS1 book which uses Python as the programming language. Fair enough, that kind of takes some responsibility off of the author's shoulders ("Hey, I'm trying to teach you something broad here, not all these syntax and security details"), but when I started reading it I noticed, in literally the very first example, the use of x = eval(input("Enter your number: ")) where x should be an int and thus we need to convert user input into an int. I'm using Python 2.7.4 and the book is about Python 3, so I faced quite a lot of problems with print() and input() and eval() right from the very beginning and had to do some research to get the examples to work. In the course of my research, I've read countless opinions about eval() in Python (mostly here on SO) which boil down to it being almost always bad, a security risk, an unnecessary technical overhead and so on. The questions of the users were a lot more elaborate (there was one about using eval() when doing a wxPython project), so I can't vouch for total similarity between my case and their cases, but still... So, I admit, I'm not too far into the book, but I've reached the point where, a bit later on, the author explained the use of eval() with no reference to its controversial nature whatsoever. He basically said what I just said: we need x to eventually be an int, so here's a handy way to do that. And he seems to be using it ever after. My question is this: if, right from the beginning, an author makes such a mistake (or is it NOT a mistake? I might be missing something here), is it a book worth learning from? I believe Mr. Zelle is a great teacher of CS, and it shows, but whether he wants it or not, people will still learn Python from his book as well, in addition to algorithms and the art of programming. So is it worth learning Python from a book which stays silent over such a seemingly universal issue in the Python community? I don't want Mr. Zelle to be a Python hacker and uncover all of its secrets, but little details like these can make or break someone who's self-teaching/self-learning. What will your advice be with regards to this learning material? P.S. On the other hand, making me do quite a bit of research and experimentation (unwittingly) right from the start is pretty cool :-) Thank you!

@TITLE:Switched to VS 2012 and now form doesnt resize properly?
@CONTENT:I switched to VS 2012 yesterday from VS 2010 and all seemed to go well except this. I have a button on my form that when pressed extends the width of the form to show additional controls. Press the button again and it reduces the width to hide those controls. Now all of this worked great in VS 2010 and also works fine when I debug in VS 2012 but as soon as I publish or compile the project and open the .exe when you click on the button it adds like 5 to the width instead of the 100+ it needs to. I click it again and it will then change it to 372 like it should and shows all my controls. I click it again to hide the controls and it hides the controls partially (goes to the 188 + the mysterious 5) I hope all of this makes sense and am hoping there is a better way to run the process I need to. Here is the code I am currently working with and I didn't change anything between switching from 2010 to 2012.

        </aside>
 My CSS for the "box" class is irrelevant but I will include it to avoid any questions: .box {

 I appreciate any help in removing this double border. Thank you! UPDATE: When I tried this CSS rule: * {
    border: none !important;
}
 only Google's border was removed. The picture is below:

@CONTENT:I tried running git p4 submit on a repo that I've been running as an interim bridge between git and perforce. Multiple people are using the repo as a remote and its being periodically submitted back to perforce. It's been working mostly fine, except for some duplicated perforce commits whose bizarre behaviour I can't seem to reproduce. Then one day out of the blue I get this error. I can no longer push any git commits to perforce. user@hostname:~/Source/code$ git p4 submit -M --export-labels

 That error looks a lot like this error: git-p4 submit fails with patch does not apply except I'm NOT doing any keyword substitution, so I have no idea what it could be. adding --verbose doesn't seem to help explain much (I don't have that command output on hand) The only change I could imagine is that I added a .gitattributes file with the following contents below at the time that I made the commit. However, commits made before this commit while that gitattributes file was in place did work, so it couldn't be that (I've since made the .gitattributes file more detailed) * text eol=lf
 I have tried rolling back the commits in this remote repo to right before this offending commit, and then repushing them from my repo to this remote repo and then resubmitting. Same behavior. I tried rolling back, and making different edits to the same file, repushing, resubmitting. Same behavior. And it only seems to happen with these files. Since the rollback I have tried making edits to other files and they work. I tried running dos2unix to force unix line endings on offending files, and that didn't fix it either. What command can give me a better explanation of what is going on here? Is there a git log file I could tail? Any assistance would be appreciated. edit: I've retested my issue with and without the .gitattributes file. that made no difference. currently my global core.autocrlf setting is input. But with the .gitattributes file missing that seemed to make no difference. Here's what it looked like when I retested it with just one of the offending files with --verbose turned on. user@hostname:/code$ git p4 submit -M --export-labels --verbose

@TITLE:Drastic performance differences: debug vs release
@CONTENT:I have a simple algorithm which converts a bayer image channel (BGGR,RGGB,GBRG,GRBG) to rgb (demosaicing but without neighbors). In my implementation I have pre-set offset vectors which help me to translate the bayer channel index to its corresponding rgb channel indices. Only problem is I'm getting awful performance in debug mode with MSVC11. Under release, for an input of 3264X2540 size the function completes in ~60ms. For the same input in debug, the function completes in ~20,000ms. That's more than X300 difference and since some developers are runnig my application in debug, it's unacceptable. My code: void ConvertBayerToRgbImageDemosaic(int* BayerChannel, int* RgbChannel, int Width, int 

Height, ColorSpace ColorSpace)
{
    int rgbOffsets[4]; //translates color location in Bayer block to it's location in RGB block. So R->0, G->1, B->2
    std::vector<int> bayerToRgbOffsets[4]; //the offsets from every color in the Bayer block to (bayer) indices it will be copied to (R,B are copied to all indices, Gr to R and Gb to B).
    //calculate offsets according to color space
    switch (ColorSpace)
    {
    case ColorSpace::BGGR:
            /*
             B G
             G R
            */ 
        rgbOffsets[0] = 2; //B->0
        rgbOffsets[1] = 1; //G->1
        rgbOffsets[2] = 1; //G->1
        rgbOffsets[3] = 0; //R->0
        //B is copied to every pixel in it's block
        bayerToRgbOffsets[0].push_back(0);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[0].push_back(1);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[0].push_back(Width);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[0].push_back(Width + 1);
        //Gb is copied to it's neighbouring B
        bayerToRgbOffsets[1].push_back(-1);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[1].push_back(0);
        //GR is copied to it's neighbouring R
        bayerToRgbOffsets[2].push_back(0);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[2].push_back(1);
        //R is copied to every pixel in it's block
        bayerToRgbOffsets[3].push_back(-Width - 1);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[3].push_back(-Width);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[3].push_back(-1);
        bayerToRgbOffsets[3].push_back(0);
        break;
    ... other color spaces
    }

    for (auto row = 0; row < Height; row++)
    {
        for (auto col = 0, bayerIndex = row * Width; col < Width; col++, bayerIndex++)
        {
            auto colorIndex = (row%2)*2 + (col%2); //0...3, For example in BGGR: 0->B, 1->Gb, 2->Gr, 3->R
            //iteration over bayerToRgbOffsets is O(1) since it is either sized 2 or 4.
            std::for_each(bayerToRgbOffsets[colorIndex].begin(), bayerToRgbOffsets[colorIndex].end(), 
                [&](int colorOffset)
                {
                    auto rgbIndex = (bayerIndex + colorOffset) * 3 + rgbOffsets[offset];
                    RgbChannel[rgbIndex] = BayerChannel[bayerIndex];
                });
        }
    }
}
 What I've tried: I tried turing on optimization (/O2) for the debug build with no significant differences. I tried replacing the inner for_each statement with a plain old for loop but to no avail. I have a very similar algorithm which converts bayer to "green" rgb (without copying the data to neighboring pixels in the block) in which I'm not using the std::vector and there there is the expected runtime difference between debug and release (X2-X3). So, could the std::vector be the problem? If so, how do I overcome it?

@LINK:/questions/15928750/numerical-ode-solving-in-python
@TITLE:numerical ODE solving in python
@CONTENT:I am new to Python so at this moment in time, I can only very basic problems. How do I numerically solve an ODE in Python? Consider \ddot{u}(\phi) = -u + \sqrt{u}
 with the following conditions u(0) = 1.49907
 and \dot{u}(0) = 0
 with the constraint 0 <= \phi <= 7\pi.
 Then finally I want to produce a parametric plot where the x and y coordinates are generated as a function of u. The problem is I need to run odeint twice since this is a second order differential equation. I tried having it run again after the first time but it comes back with a Jacobian error. There must be away to run the twice all at once. Here is the error: odepack.error: The function and its Jacobian must be callable functions
 which the code below generates. The line in question is the sol = odeint. import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy import linspace


def f(u, t):
    return -u + np.sqrt(u)


times = linspace(0.0001, 7 * np.pi, 1000)
y0 = 1.49907
yprime0 = 0
yvals = odeint(f, yprime0, times)

sol = odeint(yvals, y0, times)

x = 1 / sol * np.cos(times)
y = 1 / sol * np.sin(times)

plot(x,y)

plt.show()
 Edit I am trying to construct the plot on page 9 Classical Mechanics Taylor Here is the plot with Mathematica In[27]:= sol =

   y'[0] == 0}, y, {t, 0, 10*\[Pi]}];

In[28]:= ysol = y[t] /. sol[[1]];

@LINK:/questions/15928644/how-to-use-a-resource-to-populate-angular-ui-bootstrap-typeahead
@TITLE:How to use a $resource to populate Angular UI Bootstrap typeahead
@CONTENT:I am trying to get Angular UI bootstraps typeahead working with a REST resource I have set up. But I am not sure how to get it working with it's asynchronous nature. At the moment I have adapted the example given by Angular UI Bootstrap. so my html looks like so, calling getLibs() to get the list for the typeahead dropdown. <div class='container-fluid' ng-controller="TypeaheadCtrl">
    <pre>Model: {{selected| json}}</pre>
    <input type="text"  typeahead="lib.name for lib in getLibs($viewValue)" active='active' ng-model="selected" typeahead-min-length='3' >
</div>
 my resource looks like so: angular.module('LibraryLookupService', ['ngResource']).factory('Library', 
    function($resource){
        return $resource(   "../../api/seq/library/?name__icontains=:searchStr" , {} , 
        {   'get':    {method:'GET'},
            'query':  {method:'GET', params: {} ,  isArray:false },
        }
    )
}
 ); my controller looks like so (I am guessing it is here I am doing something incorrect): function TypeaheadCtrl($scope , Library){

    $scope.selected = undefined;
    $scope.active = undefined ;

    $scope.libs = [{name:'initial'} , {name:"values"}];

    $scope.getLibs = function(viewValue){
        console.log("value:", viewValue);
        if (viewValue.length > 3 ) { 
            var return_vals =  Library.query({searchStr:viewValue},  function() {
                $scope.libs = return_vals.objects ; 
                console.log("here", $scope.libs) ; 
                }) ;
            }
        return $scope.libs
    }
}
 So as I understand it, the typeahead menu is being populated from the return value of the getLibs() function. When getLibs() is called it is querying the REST interface, but initially an empty value is returned. This is being populated by the function supplied to the Library.query() method, and this is done after the data is returned from the REST request. This means basically that the menu is being updated one keypress later than what I want. I type '3456' and it gets populated with results of a '345' query to the REST interface. How do I get the menu to update when the response is returned from the Library.query() function? Am I going about this correctly?
@CODE:<div class='container-fluid' ng-controller="TypeaheadCtrl">
    <pre>Model: {{selected| json}}</pre>
    <input type="text"  typeahead="lib.name for lib in getLibs($viewValue)" active='active' ng-model="selected" typeahead-min-length='3' >
</div> angular.module('LibraryLookupService', ['ngResource']).factory('Library', 
    function($resource){
        return $resource(   "../../api/seq/library/?name__icontains=:searchStr" , {} , 
        {   'get':    {method:'GET'},
            'query':  {method:'GET', params: {} ,  isArray:false },
        }
    )
} function TypeaheadCtrl($scope , Library){

    $scope.selected = undefined;
    $scope.active = undefined ;

@CONTENT:I have the following Code: if(

 And after having netbeans reformat it i get if(

 which is not what I want. I already tried changing Editor>Formatting>PHP>Wrapping>If Statement - but I could not even figure out what this option does, but at least it seems not to solve my issue. How can I make netbeans format multiconditonal ifs as I like them (or just leave them as they are)?

@TITLE:How to solve Redirect Loop
@CONTENT:I have a web application, and some users who use Chrome as their preferred browser of choice, get the following error when they have logged out of the application, and try to log back in. "This webpage has a redirect loop". My web application uses forms authentication, and the FormAuthenticationModule redirects the user back to the Login page of my application, so I cannot use this approach: <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="~/MyErrorPage.aspx" >

    <error statusCode="401" redirect="~/NoAccess.aspx"/>

</customErrors>
 Instead, I have added the following to the Page_Load event of my LoginPage. if (Request.IsAuthenticated && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["ReturnUrl"]))
{
    Response.Redirect("~/NoAccess.aspx");
}
 However, since I have added this approach, the users seem to get the "Redirect Loop" error. After clearing the cookies, all seems well, but the problem does occur again. Is there a permanent fix for this I can add to my code, or is there anything else I can do to prevent this issue from happening?

@LINK:/questions/15835415/robospice-persist-json-array-with-ormlite
@TITLE:RoboSpice persist JSON array with OrmLite
@CONTENT:I'm using RoboSpice with Spring for Android and would like to persist a JSON array of objects with OrmLite. GSON is used for the JSON marshalling. With the default caching everything works as expected. But OrmLite doesn't seem to like the array of objects. This is a simplified version of the JSON: [{"id": 1, "title": "Test 1"},{"id": 2, "title": "Test 3"},{"id": 3, "title": "Test 3"}]
 I would like to persist this in the following object: @DatabaseTable
public class Foo {
    @DatabaseField(id = true)
    private int id;
    @DatabaseField
    private String title;

    // getters and setters
    ...
}
 Based on the RoboSpice OrmLite example I've created the following GsonSpringAndroidSpiceService class to add the OrmLite CacheManager. This is where the problem starts. public class CustomGsonSpringAndroidSpiceService extends GsonSpringAndroidSpiceService
{
    @Override
    public CacheManager createCacheManager(Application application)
    {
        // add persisted classes to class collection
        List<Class<?>> classCollection = new ArrayList<Class<?>>();
        classCollection.add(Foo.class);

        // init
        CacheManager cacheManager = new CacheManager();
        cacheManager.addPersister(new InDatabaseObjectPersisterFactory(
            application, new RoboSpiceDatabaseHelper(
                application, "database.db", 1), classCollection));
        return cacheManager;
    }
}
 This results in the following error: RequestProcessor.java:174(22356): java.lang.RuntimeException: Class [Lcom.example.model.Foo; is not handled by any registered factoryList
 When I change classCollection.add(Foo.class); to classCollection.add(Foo[].class); I get the following error: RequestProcessor.java:174(22601): 14:42:23.112 pool-5-thread-1 An unexpected error occured when processsing request CachedSpiceRequest [requestCacheKey=foo, cacheDuration=-1, spiceRequest=com.example.app.FooRequest@4055df40]
RequestProcessor.java:174(22601): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No fields have a DatabaseField annotation in class [Lcom.example.app.model.Foo;
 Anyone an idea how to handle a JSON array with the OrmLite CacheManager ?

@LINK:/questions/15776732/how-to-convert-a-vector-of-strings-to-title-case
@TITLE:How to convert a vector of strings to Title Case [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Capitalize the first letter of both words in a two word string 7 answers I have a vector of strings in lower case. I'd like to change them to title case, meaning the first letter of every word would be capitalized. I've managed to do it with a double loop, but I'm hoping there's a more efficient and elegant way to do it, perhaps a one-liner with gsub and a regex. Here's some sample data, along with the double loop that works, followed by other things I tried that didn't work. strings = c("first phrase", "another phrase to convert",
            "and here's another one", "last-one")

# For each string in the strings vector, find the position of each 
#  instance of a space followed by a letter
matches = gregexpr("\\b[a-z]+", strings) 

# For each string in the strings vector, convert the first letter 
#  of each word to upper case
for (i in 1:length(strings)) {

  # Extract the position of each regex match for the string in row i
  #  of the strings vector.
  match.positions = matches[[i]][1:length(matches[[i]])] 

  # Convert the letter in each match position to upper case
  for (j in 1:length(match.positions)) {

    substr(strings[i], match.positions[j], match.positions[j]) = 
      toupper(substr(strings[i], match.positions[j], match.positions[j]))
  }
}
 This worked, but it seems inordinately complicated. I resorted to it only after experimenting unsuccessfully with more straightforward approaches. Here are some of the things I tried, along with the output: # Google search suggested \\U might work, but evidently not in R
gsub("(\\b[a-z]+)", "\\U\\1" ,strings)
[1] "Ufirst Uphrase"                "Uanother Uphrase Uto Uconvert"
[3] "Uand Uhere'Us Uanother Uone"   "Ulast-Uone"                   

# I tried this on a lark, but to no avail
gsub("(\\b[a-z]+)", toupper("\\1"), strings)
[1] "first phrase"              "another phrase to convert"
[3] "and here's another one"    "last-one"  
 The regex captures the correct positions in each string as shown by a call to gregexpr, but the replacement string is clearly not working as desired. If you can't already tell, I'm relatively new to regexes and would appreciate help on how to get the replacement to work correctly. I'd also like to learn how to structure the regex so as to avoid capturing a letter after an apostrophe, since I don't want to change the case of those letters.
@CODE:gsub strings = c("first phrase", "another phrase to convert",
            "and here's another one", "last-one")

# For each string in the strings vector, find the position of each

matches = gregexpr("\\b[a-z]+", strings)

#  of each word to upper case
for (i in 1:length(strings)) {

  # Extract the position of each regex match for the string in row i

  match.positions = matches[[i]][1:length(matches[[i]])] 

  # Convert the letter in each match position to upper case

    substr(strings[i], match.positions[j], match.positions[j]) =

@TITLE:Symfony 2.2 extend ExceptionController
@CONTENT:This question is related to the following change (part of Symfony 2.2 release): Part 1 In pre-2.2 Symfony, I was overriding ExceptionController to display some custom error pages. I did that via: parameters:
       twig.exception_listener.controller: My\CustomBundle\CustomExceptionController::showAction
 Now, after upgrading to 2.2, I can no longer do that, because an exception is thrown while generating an exception (no pun intended): ExceptionController::__construct() must be an instance of Twig_Environment, none given, called in... Since ExceptionController is a service now, how can I override that, and what do I need to change in my old code? All I did in the custom class, is changed the template reference in showAction method: $template = new TemplateReference('TwigBundle', 'Exception', $name, $format, 'twig');
 Part 2 Since ExceptionController no longer extends ContainerAware, how do I get to the current container? Is it enough to implement ContainerAwareInterface?
@CODE:ExceptionController parameters:
       twig.exception_listener.controller: My\CustomBundle\CustomExceptionController::showAction ExceptionController $template = new TemplateReference('TwigBundle', 'Exception', $name, $format, 'twig'); ExceptionController ContainerAware ContainerAwareInterface

@LINK:/questions/15769948/round-a-python-list-of-numbers-and-maintain-the-sum
@TITLE:Round a Python list of numbers and maintain the sum
@CONTENT:I have a list or an array of decimal numbers in Python. I need to round them to the nearest 2 decimal places as these are monetary amounts. But, I need the overall sum to be maintained, i.e. the sum of the original array rounded to 2 decimal places must be equal to the sum of the rounded elements of the array. Here's my code so far: myOriginalList = [27226.94982, 193.0595233, 1764.3094, 12625.8607, 26714.67907, 18970.35388, 12725.41407, 23589.93271, 27948.40386, 23767.83261, 12449.81318]
originalTotal = round(sum(myOriginalList), 2)
# Answer = 187976.61

# Using numpy
myRoundedList = numpy.array(myOriginalList).round(2)
# New Array = [ 27226.95    193.06   1764.31  12625.86  26714.68  18970.35  12725.41 23589.93 27948.4   23767.83  12449.81]

newTotal = myRoundedList.sum()
# Answer = 187976.59
 I need an efficient way of amending my new rounded array such that the sum is also 187976.61. The 2 pence difference needs to be applied to items 7 and 6 as these have the greatest difference between the rounded entries and the original entries. Any ideas?
@CODE:myOriginalList = [27226.94982, 193.0595233, 1764.3094, 12625.8607, 26714.67907, 18970.35388, 12725.41407, 23589.93271, 27948.40386, 23767.83261, 12449.81318]

@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Do DOM tree elements with ids become global variables? 3 answers I noticed the following: <div id='myDiv'>...</div>

<script>
    myDiv.style.color = 'red'; // I can access the object.
<script>
 Before realizing this, I was always using the following: var x = document.getElementById('myDiv'); 
x.style.color = 'red';
 I am confused. What's the point of the second approach? Does the first approach always work?

@LINK:/questions/15761489/python-respond-to-command-line-prompts
@TITLE:Python: Respond to Command Line Prompts
@CONTENT:I am trying to use Python to interact with another program via the command line. The main problem I am having is a specific call that has multiple follow-up prompts. Initially the command line call asks for the name of a project and then proceeds to ask if I would like to view any of the subfolders of the project. I need to answer y/n to each of these in order and the answer to each is unfortunately not all y or n. Additionally, I cannot know the answer to the question without reading the individual prompts so I am incapable of sending a block of 'y's or 'n's all at once. This is the command line call: si viewproject After entering the command, the command line prompts: Enter the project name: And an example response would be: Enter the project name: c:/test.pj After entering the project, it prompts the following: Do you want to recurse into the subproject test_subprj.pj? [ynYN](n) At which point I need to respond with either a y or n depending on if I need that subproject. Again, the response to this question is dependent on the subproject. I need to be able to read the subproject in this prompt in order to respond to it with a 'y' or 'n' Currently I need to manually enter in the project and each of the y's and n's respectively. My goal is to automate this process using Python. Is there a way to respond to these command line prompts automatically? Current Progress Subprocess Strategy  project_path = "c:/test.pj"

 with Popen(["si", "viewproject", "--project=" + project_path], 
             stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, universal_newlines=True) as p:
     for line in p.stdout: 
         if line.startswith("Do you want"):
             answer = 'n'
         else:
             continue # skip it
         print(answer, file=p.stdin) # provide answer
         p.stdin.flush()
 This method is hanging after the with Popen statement. It never errors, but it never enters or exits the for statement and never completes. Currently I am defaulting all answers to "n", but that will be replaced with logic later. Winpexpect Strategy  import re
 import sys

 for found in iter(partial(p.expect, patterns), 1): # until EOF
     if found == 0:
         answer = 'n'

 Installing Winpexpect Lazy Persons Way Install Distribute Do This Install PyWin32 Install Winpexpect Optional: Install Nose Optional: Install Pip First-World Problems Python is a new language for me, and I had never installed a package before for Python. Additionally, Python 3.x is a little different than the other versions of Python making installing modules a little bit more of an adventure. So, to help others get some sweet sweet module action (and to help those who are more knowledgeable see if I did anything wrong) here's a soon to be success story (hopefully) documenting how I got and installed my first module. Setup Python allows third-party groups to develop and distribute modules that extend the abilities of the programming language. Naturally, there is a standard way to help third-party developers make modules as easily available to the end-user as possible. For Python 3.x, that standard for distributing modules is called Distutils. Here is how a developer uses Distutils: Distributing Python Modules And here is how the end-user uses Distutils: Installing Python Modules Normally, navigating to the folder of your downloaded module in the command line and running "setup.py install" will be enough. BUT Sometimes life isn't so easy and you may still have problems with your installation. You may, in fact, need something else. For example, you may get the following error: "ImportError ：No Module named Setuptools；" Luckily, there is a solution for that: Python 3: ImportError "No Module named Setuptools" As it turns out, not everything uses distutils. Some packages use setuptools. Unfortunately, there is no setuptools for Python 3.x. Rather, Python 3.x uses distribute which is a branch of setuptools. So for those who use Python 3.x, here is Distribute: Distribute For those using Python 2.x, here is Setuptools: Setuptools In the Installation Instructions for Distribute, it says the following: "Download distribute_setup.py <http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py>_ and execute it, using the Python interpreter of your choice." It also says: "Notice this file is also provided in the source release." So I downloaded Distribute and saved it to the computer. Once it was saved to the computer, I ran distribute_setup.py from the source release and got the following error: Downloading http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.36.tar.gz

 Well that is no good! I honestly still do not know where that error is coming from or why it happened. Regardless, then I found the following site that ran a .exe to install distribute as well as pip. Install Distribute Install Pip So I got those installed and then used the following site to setup my computer to more easily use easy_install: Setting Up Easy Install Made Easy Once I got this working I then installed nose:Nose The reason I got nose was because the Winpexpect website says: "WinPexpect includes unit tests. To run the tests, you need nose. Use the following command to run the tests: $ python setup.py test" Well that sounds nice :). Now I just wished I knew where to run that test. I know that if you install manually you use the setup.py install command so there will most definitely be a setup.py in the zipped directory online. To see if this was correct, I downloaded and saved the winpexpect file, extracted the information, navigated to it via command-line, and ran setup.py test. Here was the following result: running test

 Ok, so the Python 3.3 version of Nose contains invalid syntax for Python 3.3? print "%s version %s" % (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]), version)... should definitely have parenthesis around it... This makes me question if nose will actually work here as it clearly looks to be made for earlier versions of Python.

@CONTENT:I have a Rails 3 app that I'm developing locally and deploying on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk for production. There's several places in my app where images can be uploaded through HTML forms. After upload, I'm then sending the files to S3 for storage. I have no trouble with this workflow while developing locally, but in production, I'm getting a 500 Internal Server Error response during the upload (I'm fairly sure it's before any communication with S3). I ssh'ed into my EC2 instance found traces of the error in /var/app/support/logs/passenger.log. Here's the line that's generated during upload. 2013/03/30 00:58:52 [crit] 1723#0: *196227 open() "/tmp/passenger-standalone.1645/client_body_temp/0000000014" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: ip_address, server: _, request: "POST /admin/users/1 HTTP/1.1", host: "www.my_domain.com", referrer: "https://www.my_domain.com/admin/users/1/edit" Does anyone have any words of wisdom as to why I'm not able to upload a file to Elastic Beanstalk from my Rails?

@LINK:/questions/15691740/does-assignment-with-advanced-indexing-copy-array-data
@TITLE:Does assignment with advanced indexing copy array data?
@CONTENT:I am slowly trying to understand the difference between views and copys in numpy, as well as mutable vs. immutable types. If I access part of an array with 'advanced indexing' it is supposed to return a copy. This seems to be true: In [1]: import numpy as np
In [2]: a = np.zeros((3,3))
In [3]: b = np.array(np.identity(3), dtype=bool)

In [4]: c = a[b]

In [5]: c[:] = 9

In [6]: a
Out[6]: 
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.]])
 Since c is just a copy, it does not share data and changing it does not mutate a. However, this is what confuses me: In [7]: a[b] = 1

In [8]: a
Out[8]: 
array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1.]])
 So, it seems, even if I use advanced indexing, assignment still treats the thing on the left as a view. Clearly the a in line 2 is the same object/data as the a in line 6, since mutating c has no effect on it. So my question: is the a in line 8 the same object/data as before (not counting the diagonal of course) or is it a copy? In other words, was a's data copied to the new a, or was its data mutated in place? For example, is it like: x = [1,2,3]
x += [4]
 or like: y = (1,2,3)
y += (4,)
 I don't know how to check for this because in either case, a.flags.owndata is True. Please feel free to elaborate or answer a different question if I'm thinking about this in a confusing way.

I know, in R, I can change the working directory each time I want to refer to a file in one of the folders but it is definitely not a good way to do it. Even if I store the folder paths as strings in R, I can't figure out how to refer to those (like using `folder1' in Stata).

    private static object lockingObject = new object();
    private static T singleTonObject;
    protected SingletonBase()
    {

    }

I have a submit button on the login page whose POST request doesn't seem to map to a method in its corresponding login controller. The login form's action is actually mapped to the Servlet - j_spring_security_check. The entire spring-security.xml file is as follows, if it is required. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@TITLE:Why should we write custom exception classes in Java
@CONTENT:What is the purpose of writing custom exception classes when mostly what it does is same. For eg, NullPointerException: class NullPointerException extends RuntimeException {
      private static final long serialVersionUID = 5162710183389028792L;


      public NullPointerException() {
          super();
      }


      public NullPointerException(String s) {
          super(s);
      }
}
 This is the basic template for most exception classes that I have seen and created. One purpose I can think of is in handling these exception.But then cant this be based on Exception Message?. Mostly we write single handling code for each exception type. I know there are 'exceptions' to this. But is there anything more to it? Isnt this repeating yourself where only the class name changes? Also are there any JDK Exception classes that has some code than this?
@CODE:class NullPointerException extends RuntimeException {
      private static final long serialVersionUID = 5162710183389028792L;


      public NullPointerException() {
          super();
      }


      public NullPointerException(String s) {

@TITLE:A sticky Top Bar makes the page jump up when scrolling past it with Zurb Foundation
@CONTENT:I am using the Zurb Foundation 4 framework for my site. I want to have a navbar that is positioned beneath a header that sticks to the top of the page when you scroll past. This works fine, except that the page content jumps up ~45 pixels when the Top Bar sticks to the top of the page. The effect can be seen on this page, though this is a different navigation element: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/magellan.html Is there some way to fix this, or do I have to change my site design to accomodate this bug?

@TITLE:XML validation and namespaces in .NET
@CONTENT:What I'm trying to do is to validate XML against an XSD. This is all pretty straightforward, but I'm having a problem with XML's without a namespace. C# only validates the xml if the namespace matches the targetnamespace of the XSD. This seems right, but an XML with no namespace or a different one then the SchemaSet should give an exception. Is there a property or a setting to achieve this? Or do I have to get the namespace manually by reading the xmlns attribute of the xml? An example to clearify: Code: XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.Schemas.Add("http://example.com", @"test.xsd");
settings.Schemas.Add("http://example.com/v2", @"test2.xsd");
settings.ValidationType = ValidationType.Schema;

XmlReader r = XmlReader.Create(@"test.xml", settings);

XmlReader r = XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(xml), settings);
XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
try
{
    doc.Load(r);
}
catch (XmlSchemaValidationException ex)
{

    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}

@TITLE:Loading json with varying schema into PIG
@CONTENT:I ran into an issue loading a set json documents into PIG. What I have is a lot of json documents that all vary in the fields they have, the fields that I need are in most documents and in whare missing I would like to get a null value. I just downloaded and compiled the latest Pig version (0.12 straight from the apache git repository) just to be sure this hasn't been solved yet. What I have is a json document like this: {"foo":1,"bar":2,"baz":3}
 When I load this into PIG using this Json1 = LOAD 'test.json' USING JsonLoader('foo:int,bar:int,baz:int');
DESCRIBE Json1;
DUMP Json1;
 I get the expected results Json1: {foo: int,bar: int,baz: int}
(1,2,3)
 However when the fields are in a different order in the schema : Json2 = LOAD 'test.json' USING JsonLoader('baz:int,bar:int,foo:int');
DESCRIBE Json2;
DUMP Json2;
 I get an undesired result: Json2: {baz: int,bar: int,foo: int}
(1,2,3)
 That should have been (3,2,1)
 Apparently the field names in the schema definition have nothing to do with the fieldnames in the json. What I need is to load specific fields from a json file (with embedded documents!) into PIG. How do I resolve this?
@CODE:{"foo":1,"bar":2,"baz":3} Json1 = LOAD 'test.json' USING JsonLoader('foo:int,bar:int,baz:int');
DESCRIBE Json1;
DUMP Json1; Json1: {foo: int,bar: int,baz: int}
(1,2,3) Json2 = LOAD 'test.json' USING JsonLoader('baz:int,bar:int,foo:int');
DESCRIBE Json2;
DUMP Json2; Json2: {baz: int,bar: int,foo: int}
(1,2,3) (3,2,1)

@TITLE:ViewModels with asp.net mvc 4 and EntityFramework whats the Point
@CONTENT:I'm debating with myself whats the point in creating ViewModel classes in a project which uses Entity Framework? I currently have a project which uses EntityFramework. My solution is structured basically like this: UI project (contains controllers and Views) Model project (contains EntityFramework model) Services project (contains service classes which talk to Model Project to serve up the entities out of the model project to the UI project) My controllers pass the entities that Entity Framework creates straight to the view. It's nice and simple. In the past I would of created separate view model classes and mapped from the entities that EntityFramework creates to these view models. But now I'm struggling to see the point. I'm currently helping out on a project which map from the entities produced by entity framework to view models. It actually uses AutoMapper to do this. Now this all seems like a lot of effort and code for very little gain. Am I missing something here?

..... More code.
 The result looks like this: Which looks nice. The trouble is even when I enter valid values for a TextBox a red border remains. Like you can see in the title and full name TextBoxes here. How do I remove this residue red border? Where is it coming from?

@TITLE:Large TFSUser\AppData\Local\Temp Directory on Build Machine
@CONTENT:I'm using TFS 2012 Update 1 on Windows Server 2008 R2. We have the TFS build running under the account TFSUser. The other day we ran out of space on our build machine. Upon investigation I found that the folder C:\Users\TFSUser\AppData\Local\Temp had over 50GB of files in it, some dating back as far as October of 2012. None of the files are overly large, but they don't ever seem to get cleaned up. Investigating today shows that folder gets written to a lot during an automated build. Why aren't these files getting cleaned up and what can I do to ensure my build machine doesn't run out of space again due to this issue? Update 2013-03-13 I created a small powershell script that runs nightly to delete the temp directory contents. Here's the powershell script: Stop-Service TFSBuildServiceHost.2012
Remove-Item Drive:\Path\To\TFSUser\AppData\Local\Temp\* -recurse -exclude Build*
Start-Service TFSBuildServiceHost.2012
 I have the task run with elevated privileges nightly as the TFSUser account. The elevated privileges are needed because we need to start and stop services.

  (222) - 000 - 1114
 and the following numbers are invalid 1 (222) - 000 - 11

 using "?9 (999) - 999- 9999" will not work since it makes the whole thing optional If this cant be done in masked can someone help me out with regular expression to achieve this?

@TITLE:How to migrate single-token cluster to a new vnodes cluster without downtime?
@CONTENT:We have Cassandra cluster with single token per node, total 22 nodes, average load per node is 500Gb. It has SimpleStrategy for the main keyspace and SimpleSnitch. We need to migrate all data to the new datacenter and shutdown the old one without a downtime. New cluster has 28 nodes. I want to have vnodes on it. I'm thinking of the following process: Migrate the old cluster to vnodes Setup the new cluster with vnodes Add nodes from the new cluster to the old one and wait until it balances everything Switch clients to the new cluster Decommission nodes from the old cluster one by one But there are a lot of technical details. First of all, should I shuffle the old cluster after vnodes migration? Then, what is the best way to switch to NetworkTopologyStrategy and to GossipingPropertyFileSnitch? I want to switch to NetworkTopologyStrategy because new cluster has 2 different racks with separate power/network switches.

@LINK:/questions/15328666/run-a-sparql-query-against-two-graphs
@TITLE:run a sparql query against two graphs?
@CONTENT:A typical SPARQL query that specifies a graph might look like this: SELECT ?b ?c WHERE { GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}}
 This will tell me all the triples in AliceIRI where "foo" is a subject. What if I want to look in two different graphs, is my only option to do a UNION: SELECT ?b ?c WHERE {{ GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}}
UNION
{ GRAPH <http://BobIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}}}
 Or is there some shorthand that would allow me to write this more conveniently, something like this: SELECT ?b ?c WHERE { GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> + <http://BobIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}
 BTW I'm on Virtuoso 6.01.3127. Update 1 To clarify, I'd really like to be able to run: SELECT ?b ?c WHERE { GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> + <http://BobIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c .
<http://local.virt/bar> ?b ?c}}
 and have this match ?b and ?c such that <http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c is in <http://AliceIRI> and <http://local.virt/bar> ?b ?c is in <http://BobIRI>. Simply taking the union of matches in <http://AliceIRI> (alone) and <http://BobIRI> (alone) won't accomplish this. And to clarify further: I've realized that if the foos all belonged to Alice and the bars all belonged to Bob, then I could write SELECT ?b ?c WHERE { 
GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c } .
GRAPH <http://BobIRI> {
<http://local.virt/bar> ?b ?c}}
 (which is actually what I needed for my application) -- but at least for "academic interest" the question of whether there is a syntactically nice way to run a query against a union of graphs (as opposed to against multiple graphs and then union the results) still stands.
@CODE:SELECT ?b ?c WHERE { GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}} SELECT ?b ?c WHERE {{ GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}}
UNION
{ GRAPH <http://BobIRI> {
<http://local.virt/foo> ?b ?c}}} SELECT ?b ?c WHERE { GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> + <http://BobIRI> {

GRAPH <http://AliceIRI> {

To that end, I've written a number of client-side hooks, which work all right, but now I want the same checks to run when a developer pushes their modifications to the central repository. But they don't work. Here is what I want to do: I want to traverse the pushed files line by line, check for coding conventions violations and if I find any, reject the push, also showing the line numbers + violations. In my pre-commit client side hook I was able to do that by calling git diff --cached --name-status --diff-filter=AM to get the list of modified files, and git cat-file -p :filename for each of the files retrieved in the first call to get the whole text of the files. When I try to do the same in my server-side update hook, I get an empty string (for the list of the files). I also tried calling git show --pretty="format:" --name-only newrev (where newrev is the SHA I get as a parameter to the update hook, git diff-tree -r --name-only --no-commit-id <tree-ish>, and some other things I find on the net, but I can't get a clear understanding of what is going on and what I should call.

 I'm sure the two last lines are not working properly, but I don't know why. The first function works perfect. What am I doing bad? How can I fix it? Thank you! =)

@LINK:/questions/15289178/how-are-views-injected-into-the-ui-using-prism-and-mef
@TITLE:How are Views injected into the UI using PRISM and MEF?
@CONTENT:I have already searched some tutorials and even looked pluralsite Introduction to PRISM. However, most examples based on using unity containers and the some lack of information on how to implement this feature with Mef container. My simple helloworld module is based on web tutorial. My code is the same except I・m stuck only on HelloModule and using Mef, not Unity as tutorial shows: The main my problem how to initialize my view with my view model. The only working way I have found via experimenting is to initialize view-model in View constructor: HelloView.xaml.cs
namespace Hello.View
{
    [Export]
    public partial class HelloView : UserControl, IHelloView
    {
        public HelloView()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            Model = new HelloViewModel(this);
        }

        public IHelloViewModel Model
        {
            //get { return DataContext as IHelloViewModel; }
            get { return (IHelloViewModel)DataContext; }
            set { DataContext = value; }
        }
    }
}
 And standard module initialization code: [ModuleExport(typeof(HelloModule), InitializationMode=InitializationMode.WhenAvailable)]
    public class HelloModule : IModule
    {
        IRegionManager _regionManager;

        [ImportingConstructor]
        public HelloModule(IRegionManager regionManager)
        {
            _regionManager = regionManager;
        }

        public void Initialize()
        {
            _regionManager.Regions[RegionNames.ContentRegion].Add(ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<HelloView>());
        }
    }
 However, can someone tell the correct way how to this things, I this it must be done in Module initialization section.
@CODE:HelloView.xaml.cs
namespace Hello.View
{
    [Export]
    public partial class HelloView : UserControl, IHelloView
    {
        public HelloView()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            Model = new HelloViewModel(this);
        }

        public IHelloViewModel Model
        {
            //get { return DataContext as IHelloViewModel; }
            get { return (IHelloViewModel)DataContext; }
            set { DataContext = value; }
        }
    }
} [ModuleExport(typeof(HelloModule), InitializationMode=InitializationMode.WhenAvailable)]
    public class HelloModule : IModule
    {
        IRegionManager _regionManager;

        [ImportingConstructor]
        public HelloModule(IRegionManager regionManager)
        {
            _regionManager = regionManager;
        }

        public void Initialize()
        {
            _regionManager.Regions[RegionNames.ContentRegion].Add(ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<HelloView>());
        }
    }

@CONTENT:Enabling post privacy gating in the Page's privacy settings allows creating of posts with separate Gating and Targeting. Enable: Post: Now I have been able to get news feed targeting to work through the api by specifying the param feed_targeting when as specified in the docs. However there is only one mention of Gating in the docs: Gating vs. Targeting Gating a post is restricted to only language and country currently. This is different from news feed targeting because a gated post to a language or country will not show up to a user outside of the gating criteria. Using targeting, the post will be visible on the Page and only visible to those in the targeting segment of the Page. If a user shares a post, the user・s friends will be able to see the post even if they are outside the targeting set. Is is possible to set Gating through the API?

@LINK:/questions/15258924/line-breaks-in-jquery-ajax-html-callback-cause-errors
@TITLE:Line breaks in jQuery ajax html callback cause errors
@CONTENT:I am returning a large chunk of HTML from an $.ajax call. The string coming from PHP has two line breaks at the beginning, e.g. $data = "

<div>
     <p>Here is some text</p>
</div>";
 Here is the $.ajax call: $('form#form_id').submit(function(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    $form = $(this);
    $.ajax({
        url: $form.attr('action'),
        type: $form.attr('method'),
        data: $form.serialize(),
        dataType: 'html',
        success: function(data) {
            var $html = $($.parseHTML(data));
            $html.appendTo('#container_id').hide().fadeIn(300);
        }
    });
});
 Everything works until I add the .hide().fadeIn(300) at which point it throws: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'hooks.cur = fn') jquery.js:1925. If I remove the line breaks it works. I am using the $.parseHTML because jQuery says: If a string is known to be HTML but may start with arbitrary text that is not an HTML tag, pass it to jQuery.parseHTML() which will return an array of DOM nodes representing the markup. A jQuery collection can be created from this, for example: $($.parseHTML(htmlString)). Any idea what・s going on?
@CODE:$.ajax $data = "

<div>
     <p>Here is some text</p>
</div>"; $.ajax $('form#form_id').submit(function(e){

    $form = $(this);
    $.ajax({
        url: $form.attr('action'),
        type: $form.attr('method'),
        data: $form.serialize(),
